The holding room (I didn't know what else to call it) stunk of blood, sweat, and feces. I looked around at my fellow captives, trying to calm my nerves and keep my whole body from shaking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Not exactly what I was expecting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Most didn't look any better than I felt. More than a few were muttering unintelligibly to themselves. I was pretty sure one was unconscious. Dead? A boy in his teens caught my eyes and immediately looked away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I looked back to the – corpse? And something stirred in my memories.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My brief musing was interrupted by what I can only describe as the world's most obnoxious laugh. "Boy, ya better get used to it. It won't get any easier."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Was he talking to me? I steadied my breathing, and tried to find the source of the gruff voice. An older man, in his late forties? He sat reclined against the wall, his hands behind his head and his legs splayed outward over the wooden bench. I couldn't make out much detail in the dim lighting, but he had thick, matted black hair, and a full salt-and-pepper beard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">"First time's the hardest," he said, now staring off at the black gate at the far edge of the room. He had a thick southern drawl. "Mine was a pretty, sweet little thing. Red hair. Twenty-something." He trailed off and sat silent for several seconds, then turned to look back at me, lips pursed. "You’ll get used to it. Or ya'll die. Dunn't much matter to me."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I tried to speak, but only rasped. I cleared my throat and tried again but it only came out as a sputtering cough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">That obnoxious laugh again. I grit my teeth, and some part of me decided it wouldn't be the worst thing if he was the next one I fought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I let perhaps a little too much emotion creep into my voice as I forced out the words: "Hey, you motherfucking asshat! The fuck is your problem?" I mostly didn't strain against the chains. That would've been a silly waste of effort. I definitely didn't dribble spit all over myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I'll be damned if he didn't chuckle again and look at me with a mock crybaby face. Yeah, no qualms at all with killing him next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A bell chimed. Same as last time; three short dings. I sunk back against the wall. At least I'd get a bit of a reprieve until the next bout. Best to conserve my--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">"Armond," came the voice. I froze. The chains around my neck, wrists, and ankles came unshackled. The black gate opened, and I shielded my eyes against the bright light pouring through from on the other side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c1">No. Not yet. Not so soon. Everyone else had more time! They couldn't--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">"Armond," the voice repeated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">More fucking obnoxious laughter. Barely able to contain my anger, I walked over and kicked the man in the chest. Or at least, that was my intention. Instead, I crumpled into a ball as a jolt of pain shot up my spine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">"Armond," the voice repeated. I scrambled to recover, wobbling slightly as I got to my feet and recovered my balance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The man continued to mock me, grinning like an idiot. "Well?! Ya'd best go, boy. It only gets worse."</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Glaring daggers and grinding my teeth, I went.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Stepping through the gate and into the blinding light, I squinted and shielded my eyes as they adjusted, crouching low and examining the surroundings. It wasn't so much that I felt like fainting--I just didn't want to be caught off guard again. At least, that’s what I told myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Just as before, I found myself in a new place entirely. There was no door or corridor behind me--why would there be? Nothing about this place made sense. I found myself in an area surrounded on three sides by implausibly high stone walls--no visible entrances or exits--under a cloudless sky with the sun almost directly overhead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">To my right stood an imposing Gothic-style keep; one might be forgiven for thinking it had somehow been lifted straight out of a fantasy book. To my left, a few dozen meters off, was a sheer cliff overlooking a ravine so deep it made the walls look reasonable in comparison. Before the cliff was a well-kept garden and a small grove of sapling oak trees. Ahead was a plain cobbled street. And In the distance, perhaps a couple hundred meters ahead, I spotted them. My opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">...And they were sprinting straight for the keep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I cursed under my breath. They weren't even looking in my direction, and already had a few seconds head-start. Dare I risk running after them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">(Adrenaline is such a funny thing, I thought, feeling my sympathetic nervous system kick into overdrive, banishing the dizziness and lightheadedness in an instant.) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">After only a moment's hesitation, I scrambled off to the left, ducking behind a bush and peering around from marginally better cover. I decided I would wait, and scope out the environment. Maybe there was another entrance? At any rate, it didn't take long for them to reach the keep. They didn't even spare a glance backwards, immediately flinging open the wooden doors and slamming them just as quickly behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Huh, interesting. That alone told me quite a lot about them and what to expect. Either they really didn't want to be caught in the open, or perhaps they would just benefit more from fighting a confined space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">"...Godmotherfuckingdammit, Armond. Nice going." I mentally kicked myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Well, nothing for it now. Glancing about, I didn't see anything of note in the gardens or elsewhere. My best shot was probably finding another entrance. Cautiously, I picked up the largest rock I could conveniently carry in one hand and set out to scout around back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">...At least, that's what I had intended. When I reached the gap between the keep and those ridiculously tall walls, I heard a ghastly screech, followed by rhythmic scraping noises that sounded distinctly what I imagined chitin on stone might sound like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I froze, looking up at the source of the noise. Climbing down from the roof was a thing that looked like someone grafted the legs, mouths, and eyes of half a dozen giant spiders together because, fuck you, that's why. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">"WHAT THE FUCK?! NO, THIS IS COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT," I calmly remarked, doubling back to the front of the keep and making my way to the doors with perhaps not as much caution. Thankfully, the creature didn't follow. In fact, and somewhat suspiciously, it stopped paying attention to me as soon as I rounded the corner. I didn’t want to think about the implications.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">A moment later I found myself standing in front of the doors, struck by a sudden appreciation for their craftsmanship. They were a deep, rich brown wood; polished smooth and with dozens of fist-sized iron rivets along the edges. I couldn't really tell if the rivets were functional or aesthetic. In fact, I didn't know much about construction of keeps, or really anything about big loomy doors for that matter. Still, I could tell that someone put in a hell of a lot of effort to make these doors appear particularly loomy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">High up above came the screech again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">"OKAY, ALRIGHT? I GET IT. FINE." I called out to no-one in particular. I took a deep breath and pulled the doors open, stepping through into the keep with my rock ready. Not exactly the most effective weapon, but it was better than nothing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I'm not sure what I expected. A grand ballroom? A throne room? A great hall? There was nothing of the sort. Only a long hallway stretching into the distance. I crept forward, keeping my ears open and scanning along the rows of lit torches for any sign of movement. Oddly, even after several paces I didn't notice the end of the hall getting any closer. In fact, I was pretty sure this hallway had to be longer than the keep...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">With an exasperated sigh, I turned around to find myself face-to-face with the loomy doors again. Nodding in resignation, I turned back around to find a three-way split in the path only a few paces ahead; two paths to either side, and a steep, narrow staircase leading upwards. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Wonderful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Well, at least this one couldn’t directly harm me. Probably? That was something. I found myself humming for no apparent reason. </span><span class="c1 c9">Left, right, straight ahead. There's no way out--you're dead. Left, right, straight ahead…</span><span class="c5 c1"> Thanks, brain. Very helpful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My first thought was to try using the rock to scrape along the walls, marking my path. I wasn’t sure if it even mattered, depending of course on the specifics of my opponent’s ability. Still, if it was anything like mine and the last guy’s, it had peculiar and very specific rules. Rules I would need to exploit, if I wanted to survive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>A few questions came to mind. Questions such as: </span><span class="c1">Did I even want to survive? What kind of life is this, anyway? Am I already dead? Is this hell?</span><span class="c6"> </span><span>I shook my head. No time for that now; I resolved to deal with the hard questions later. </span><span class="c5 c1">Focus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">To my chagrin, the rock didn’t even leave a scuff mark on the walls. I’d need something harder. Unfortunately the metal torch casings were securely fastened; very little chance of me prying one loose. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c11 c1">Plat. Plat. Sklook.</span><span class="c6"> </span><span class="c1 c8">… Plat. Plat. Sklook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>That couldn’t be good. It sounded like it was coming from the left path up ahead, and getting closer. I made my way to the juncture with some haste, and peered around the corner; I was </span><span class="c1">not</span><span class="c2"> getting caught in this hallway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Whatever put together the giant chimerical spider-thing outside probably had a hand in making this one too. About a dozen meters down the path was a massive, blob-like creature. It had two long, burly, multi-jointed arms protruding from a black, almost gelatinous body that rippled as it moved. It didn’t seem to have eyes; only two recesses where the eyes should be. Its only other facial feature was a gaping maw with rows and rows of teeth. And just for good measure, there were also mouths on the hands. Because of course it had mouths on its hands.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c1">Plat. Plat. Sklook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Whoashititmovesfast.</span><span class="c2"> It had closed a third of the distance already. I sprinted up the stairs, taking two at a time. At the top, it looked like another short hallway led to a wider room just ahead. I thought I could make out more stairs in the distance. I chanced a look backwards. Yep, the thing was following me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c1">Plat, plat. Plat, plat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Steeling myself, I promptly</span><span class="c1"> noped the fuck away</span><span class="c2">. Unsurprisingly, however, the halls decided to reorient themselves again when I wasn’t looking, and I ran face-first into a wall. Cursing under my breath, I touched the back of my hand to my face and wiped away blood. I was pretty sure my nose was broken, but that was the least of my concerns at the moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I turned back around. The creature was nearing the top. I closed my eyes and glanced behind me again. Nope, still a wall. I tried again just in case, waiting slightly longer this time. No luck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">“Fuckfuckfuckfuck.” It was at the top now, and getting close. I scampered back until I was pressed against the wall. The creature’s maws began to slather with drool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Only one thing left to try. I was dubious it would work, but I was out of options. I waved my hands frantically and jerked about in a threatening manner with my rock held high. The creature paused and turned its head fractionally, focusing on me with one of its empty eye-sockets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c5">Perfect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I met its… gaze? … and imagined the hallway being engulfed in a raging inferno, erupting from the wall behind me and flying towards the creature. As far as I knew, that was universal; everything had a healthy respect for fire. Sure enough, the creature recoiled with what I imagined was its version of an agonizing gurgle. It backpedalled, then lost its balance and slipped down the stairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My satisfaction was short-lived, however. For all its blubbery mass, it was quite agile and deceptively strong. It managed to halt its descent by slamming its arm-like things into the wall, then righted itself and took off down the stairs in a more controlled, deliberate manner, if still decidedly frantic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Biting my lip, I hopped down a few stairs and back up again, in what I knew was credulous futility. Yep, still a wall. With some trepidation, I followed after the creature before it regained its senses and came to try for me again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Back at the juncture, the creature continued straight ahead. However, the path to the door had been replaced with a stairwell not unlike the one behind me, except going down. In fact…</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea, but I turned around again, only to find the creature at the top of the stairs. It, also noticing me, gave a shrill cry and resumed its pursuit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">“Shit.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I took off to my left. Of course, it wasn’t long before I found myself back at the exact same juncture. In the dim torchlight, I saw that the creature had made its way down the stairs and was lumbering forward ahead of me--and also coming up behind me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Fuck. Loops. I hated loops.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c1">Wait, why couldn’t I see myself too?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The creature was far enough away that I had a moment to ponder before I needed to move again. With only a brief hesitation, I lobbed the rock forward as hard as I could manage, and pegged it in the back of the head. It emitted an angry gurgle and turned about, plodding after me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">However, the other creature hadn’t turned around, and was still in pursuit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">“OH, COME ON!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">That told me something, at least. I wasn’t sure what yet, but it was something. I started to race down the stairs to buy myself time, but paused midway. What if I reached the same juncture again? The last thing I wanted was to be caught in this stairway with four of the damned things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">An idea came to me. It was a stretch, but again--I really didn’t have much of a chance otherwise. It was exceedingly unlikely I could use my illusions on all four of the creatures before one of them got to me, but I probably had just enough time--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I jumped back up part-ways and met the… eye holes… of the closer one on the right, imagining a thick granite wall springing up to block the top of the stairs. Seeing it slow marginally and then stop, I did the same for the one on the left. Finally, I took a couple steps down and crouched down into a ball, pressing myself up against the stone and tucking my arms and legs in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Holding my head still, I slowly and very deliberately swiveled my eyes back and forth. Two creatures came together below me and two above me at exactly the same time, inspecting the illusory wall. I was just barely out of reach of the upper pair, but the illusions held and the ones below didn’t seem to notice me. As I guessed, their eyesight worked primarily by detecting motion. I had to fight the urge to let out a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Also as I suspected, the creatures in either pairing were definitely out-of-sync. The two left-originating creatures (using my entrance to the maze as reference) were exact copies of each other, as were the two right pairs; however the two creatures in each pairing were not mirror images. I could only conclude that I broke some kind of symmetry when I threw the rock, causing there to now be two distinct rooms rather than a single looping one. There was still something funky going on with the halls spontaneously rearranging themselves, but this was definitely an important observation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The creatures seemed to be tasting each other with their hand-mouths (</span><span class="c1">ewwww</span><span class="c2">), in what I assumed was their primary method of communication. After a moment, the left-originating pair turned around and backtracked, while the right pair stayed put.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Were they coordinating?</span><span> If I was right, the pair that just left would eventually loop back around. If they were coordinating, then they might wise up and check </span><span class="c1">up</span><span class="c2"> the stairs next. I needed to act.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Another idea. Mentally mapping out the layout in two-dimensional space, so far the only true loops had been in horizontal directions. When I attempted to travel vertically, the halls shifted when I looked away. That hunch probably wasn’t exactly right--I didn’t have enough information to be sure. I don’t think I had attempted backtracking or turning around after travelling horizontally. But perhaps…</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>With the utmost care, I gradually turned my head to the right until I was facing the upper-level creature. I let the wall illusion fade, then blinked and opened and closed my lips a few times in quick succession, careful to minimize my head and jaw movement. Just as I hoped, I got the creature’s attention, but did not alert it to my presence. I met its eye-hole-things (</span><span class="c1">I was still surprised this worked at all</span><span class="c2">) and imagined another creature plodding down the stairs above it and making some gurgling noises, before turning around and heading back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The real creature didn’t notice.</span><span class="c5 c1"> Oh, they can’t hear. Huh. That’s useful to know. Shitshititscomingcloserfuck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Hastily, I tried again, this time with an illusion of me holding a torch in one hand that cast shadows in this direction. That did it. The creature above me spun around and went for the attack. I imagined fake-me tossing the torch in its face and legging it back up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Not a moment too late. I only had a few seconds to angle my head back so I could see the bottom area again out of the corner of my eye, before the left-originating creatures returned (from the right side this time). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The one at the top paused at the juncture, ostensibly not expecting to find it empty, but eventually continued onward in the same direction. Below me, the pair were taste-communicating with each other again, but were interrupted as a third creature crashed into them from below, causing the trio to break out into a fight. That loop was certainly unexpected, but welcome all-the-same. I took the opportunity to slide back up and inch up the stairs, hoping I wouldn’t draw attention. To my relief, I did not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">It took every bit of restraint I could muster not to look back down the stairs, towards the scuffle below. I had just travelled vertically in part of a loop, and every time I had done that previously and then looked back, the halls changed in a manner that made my life more difficult. At least right now I knew there had to be three--no, wait--four connected junctures. Two parallel halls that each looped onto itself, the staircase behind the trio and ahead of me that looped, and… what the heck would happen in the other two junctures now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I needed to think before I continued. Careful so as not to look back, I side-straddled the wall to the right a-ways and sunk down, assuming the same position as earlier. If another creature came through (or looped back), with luck it wouldn’t immediately notice me unless it got an urge to poke around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Okay, I had time to breathe. What next? </span><span class="c1">My opponent.</span><span> Right. I had almost forgotten there was a </span><span class="c1">human</span><span class="c2"> adversary trying to kill me too. I needed to reinterpret what I’d seen in the context of a malicious actor trying to screw me over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">That… that actually made a lot of sense. It wasn’t the halls themselves that were out to get me, but the one manipulating them sure was. At least, that seemed like the most reasonable explanation. But if they could manipulate the geometry (topology?) of space here, why couldn’t they just put me in a dead-end room with several of the creatures to start with?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ah.</span><span class="c2"> Because there was only one creature! Initially, at least. It was only my actions that caused the room duplications and the asymmetries resulting in multiple independent copies. My opponent seemed to anticipate my actions, at least enough to get me to exploit the underlying rules to my disadvantage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">No–actually, that couldn’t be right. If it weren’t for my ability working on the creature at the start, I would have been trapped and killed straight away. That trap seemed intentional, sure, but maybe the duplications were just a coincidence. It seemed unlikely they could predict me that well--and they only had a couple minutes head-start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Could my opponent see me and react, or have some other way to detect my presence? Or did they have to plan out the shifts and loops in advance? What was I missing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">When I went up the first set of stairs, I saw an open room and another set of stairs leading upwards. If I had to guess, those stairs would have looped too, at least until I looked away, at which point I’d see a dead-end when I turned back. And as long as the creature was behind in pursuit, it was a safe bet that I’d look back at some point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>If I were my adversary hastily trying to construct traps to get </span><span class="c1">me</span><span class="c2"> killed (and assuming I couldn’t arbitrarily change things at will), it seemed a sensible thing to do to string together many such rooms, together with some looping routes, in the hopes that at least one would cause me to get stuck in a dead-end. I could bet on the vanishingly small probability of me stumbling along the “correct” path, and after the first few such rooms, then perhaps I could afford to take the time to get more creative. If that were at all necessary, of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1 c11">Plat. Plat. Sklook.</span><span class="c1 c7"> </span><span class="c1 c9">Plat. Plat. Sklook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The creature on the top loop had made its way back around again. I sat deathly still. Once more, it paused at the juncture and… sensed around? expectantly. This time, however, it decided to stay put rather than continuing on or trying another path. I could fix that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I waited until I got a good angle, then met its eyehole and worked my illusions again, using the same trick as before to send it scrambling after a doppelganger up the stairs. Listening intently, I heard a crash below me just as the noises were dying down, and the fighting began anew. Finally, I could relax for a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I took a moment to stand up and stretch. Where was I?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Right. </span><span class="c5 c1">Adversary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">What happened if I took a path my opponent didn’t plan? Initially I managed to redirect the creature back down the stairs, and then found myself in a room with--as far as I could tell--nothing but loops, at least until I mucked things up. The creatures I just redirected up the stairs in front of me had come back up from below, rather than disappearing into some other place, and it seemed sensible this would hold for the duplicated junctures. Or maybe the creatures just didn’t trigger shifts?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">What would happen if I looked back down the stairs? I had initially assumed another shift, but if it was the case that this was some sort of default-endless-loop that my opponent didn’t plan for (or hoped to trap me in), and that the shifts all had to be pre-planned, I would expect nothing to change. If I was wrong about the shifts being pre-planned, or about my opponent’s strategy, or if they had a way to observe me and alter things dynamically… Well, that could end poorly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Was there any way to hedge my bets? There were four creatures now. The worst thing that could happen would be getting caught in an intersection with one coming in on each side, or perhaps a dead-end with the squabbling creatures back at the top of the stairs if I went down now. Mentally, I mapped out the junctures again. It seemed unlikely I would be caught. As long as I didn’t draw the group’s attention, or only dealt with one of them, I should be able to continue using my illusions to buy time until I got more information or figured something out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>So, options: I could go up the stairs ahead (</span><span class="c1">I might trigger a shift that the creature didn’t?</span><span>). I could somehow get past the group below and go down the stairs in the bottommost room (</span><span class="c1">strictly speaking I don’t know if it loops that way or not...</span><span>). I could investigate the horizontal paths and see if they always looped or if I could trigger shifts there (</span><span class="c1">I also don’t know that one for sure</span><span class="c2">). I supposed I could also check out the leftmost room copies on either branch--although it would be exceptionally weird if anything unexpected happened there given what I had already observed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Then again, it occurred to me that if I </span><span class="c1">was</span><span class="c2"> stuck in an area of endless-loops, I didn’t have much prospects for the future anyway. I’d be stuck down here until the creatures caught me or my opponent decided to let me out. And that probably wouldn’t….</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Hmm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>I jogged the short way down the left path until I found my trusty rock. I </span><span class="c1">knew</span><span class="c2"> this thing would come in handy. If I was right, then the stairs going down in this juncture looped to the stairs going upwards. I laid flat on my stomach to get a look into the room below. Indeed, it did look identical to the one I was in, and just as before I couldn’t see myself in the loop. I could only expect that if I broke any symmetries I would cause more duplication.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>I had no idea what this would do, but it </span><span class="c1">surely</span><span class="c2"> wouldn’t be good for my opponent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>As straight and true as I could manage, I carefully tossed the rock down the stairs, aiming for the lower level stairs in the room below. </span><span class="c1">Just in case</span><span class="c2">, I stepped to the side, although it proved unnecessary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I waited for several seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I waited for several more seconds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I waited for over a minute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">“Well, it was worth a shot.” I said to myself, shrugging.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Then I noticed something rather peculiar: the flames on the torches were </span><span class="c1">slowing down</span><span>. They were still burning… just… </span><span class="c1">slower, </span><span>somehow. And then they </span><span class="c1">glitched</span><span>, and </span><span class="c1">stopped</span><span class="c2">. Curious, I walked over and held my hand over one. Oddly, it didn’t even feel warm. I poked the fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Around me, the entire world </span><span class="c1">fuzzed</span><span>. I don’t know how else to describe it. It just--</span><span class="c1">fuzzed</span><span class="c2">. And then everything faded to a pure white light. I rubbed my eyes and found myself back outside. It was as if the round had just started. We were back out in the courtyard, with my opponent just opposite of me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Except I was prepared this time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>As I set off at a dead sprint to get closer, he fell to his knees, clutching his head. I had been expecting something to happen. I didn’t know what, and certainly didn’t expect </span><span class="c1">this</span><span class="c2">, but I could imagine how disorienting this would be for someone caught completely unaware.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Finally, I met his eyes. They were wide with fear, pupils heavily dilated. He tried making a break for the keep again, but I imagined several dozen of those spider-monstrosities from earlier bursting from the door, climbing from the walls, and jumping down from the roof, together with a cacophony of ghastly screeching as I had heard before. And just for added effect, I added the words of the disembodied voice from the end of my previous round: </span><span class="c5 c1">“Sudden Death!”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">If he was afraid before, he was terrified now. I watched in mild amusement as he tripped over himself to avert course and run for the grove. More illusory spider-monsters leaped out at him from behind trees, forcing him ever closer to the cliff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">He was surrounded, with nowhere left to go, and I had the illusions back off. I didn’t really want to kill him. I wouldn’t if I didn’t have to. I wouldn’t if they didn’t make–</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Unbidden by me, more spider-monsters peaked over the cliff. </span><span class="c1">Fuck.</span><span class="c2"> These weren’t illusions. I tried to warn him, but before I realized what was happening, one grabbed him in its many chelicerae. To my horror, I heard only panicked screaming as he was dragged over the edge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">“Winner: Armond! Flawless victory!”</span><span class="c2"> came the voice. I only stood there; cold and numb. At least, until my own illusions turned around and started eyeing me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">“Son of a–” I turned about, and walked back through the black gate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
