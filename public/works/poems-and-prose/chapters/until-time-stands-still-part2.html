<span>"Has my flame truly gone out?" she wonders, finding herself unable to call upon its warmth as she once so readily could. Goodness only knew how much she could use its light right now. So much time she had spent wandering in circles—and upon reflection she found that the world was a far colder and far darker place than she had ever remembered it being.</span>
<br><br>
<span>...Or perhaps it had always been precisely this cold and this dark, and it was only that until now she was able to overlook as much under the auspices of hope?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She supposed it did not matter much in the grand scheme. Regardless of the truth of the matter, she found herself here once more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Here, of all places.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except...</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except this time, she understood more clearly the powers she called upon. It was nothing less than an invocation of ancient, arcane rites that allowed her to transcend time and space. —In a manner of speaking, at least.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Here, echoes of her former self stretched out behind her, as ahead did glimpses of what was to be and who she was to become. All here, all true, all unified in a single, divine crystal lattice. Connected at all points, yet unseen by any but her. Nothing "changed"; all simply <i>was</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She kept just enough distance from this wonderous structure as she stood here against the abyss, in order to keep a hold of herself and not lose herself; a careful balancing act as she looked inward, outward—simultaneously in all directions and all instants, melding with her own essence just enough to heighten her connection to it and bring it to primary focus, forgetting and losing just enough while at the same time maintaining enough perspective of the present to bring something back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a lot to keep in mind all at once, but she was quite practiced by now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much had she learned. And yet, had she grown even one iota in the intervening time? The very nature of what she was...</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shook herself. Too much. Too close. Retreading, redrawing the same lines. She needed to step back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She did this, coming here, visiting this place, not out of desperation; for she was far past being desperate. Nor out of fear, for she had long since looked upon the most wretched and vile of demons in the very pits of hell, and she had emerged—if not unscarred, at least intact.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Come to think of it, it wasn't even out of loneliness that she did this thing, for had she not in these great many years beyond years found such wonderful companionship?</span>
<br><br>
<span>If it wasn't for comfort, and it wasn't for consolation... then why? Why was it she called upon—</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stopped in her tracks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was in that moment that she realized:</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stood now in this cold dark place, alone and wholly without protection. The icy winds no longer bit at her heart. Her skin she bore to the abyssal frost; unblemished. Her mind and her senses were as sharp and as keen as they had ever been.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So then, what was it she sought here?</span>
<br><br>
<span>"My determination? Is not the very act of seeking out that light to guide me in the face of all else proof of my willingness to continue ahead?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>She started, for the words were not her own. Or rather, they were her own—only not in the usual sense of one having spoken them herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was it any wonder that the entire experience came to her in an instant? That these words wrote themselves? That she understood precisely at the outset the nature of what she would find this time?</span>
<br><br>
<span>"I am, and have always been me. I had to hide from myself once, from others, and from the world itself—but no longer. This may be a dark place, but it does not pain me..."</span>
<br><br>
<span>She closes her eyes and wipes away a frozen tear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>"...It does not pain me any more than I can bear, at least."</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looks once more ahead. Not "foreward," but elseward. To new horizons. To the person she has yet to become, to the places she would yet go, to the things she would yet do, to the love she would share and find and spread, and to the people whose lives she would touch along the way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>"I need not any flame to protect me, for I am the flame."</span>
<br><br>
<span>She takes one bold step. Her heart thrums in her chest as she realizes the true extent what those words mean.</span>
<br><br>
<span>"And I need not any false hope or illusory path to guide me, for I at all times decide where I belong."</span>
<br><br>
<span>How else? None other could decide her purpose for her. None but herself could decide who she was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another step, and another. She picks up the pace, and in unison, every facet of her self speaks with words of raw power:</span>
<br><br>
<span>—She snaps awake.</span>
<br><br>
<span>"I cannot yet speak these words. But I know their meaning; it rests, buried within me. I must find the truest way to express them."</span>
