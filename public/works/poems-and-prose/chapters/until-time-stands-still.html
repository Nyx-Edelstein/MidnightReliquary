"It will be over before I know it," she says to herself. "I will reach the end soon. Only a short while longer and I will make it through." But these are little more than empty words, meant only to distract her from the truth. Empty words; she knows this, and yet she says them still, desperate for consolation as she trudges along through the endless abyss. In truth, she hadn't the faintest idea how much longer this road stretched out before her. But pretending she did meant she could pretend to fathom what lies ahead.

Her heart stings as it is assailed by the frigid, biting winds. Icy needles pierce through to her bones. Her mind slows. Her senses numb in the cold dark, and she yearns so badly to forget herself. It would be so easy to let it all go, to escape from this seemingly unending darkness. All she had to do is close her eyes and rest. The pain would subside and she would be somewhere far, far away from here.

She turns an eye inwards, seeking once more the flame that burns within. In this desolate place she draws upon its warmth for nourishment, for it is all she has. She speaks again, invigorated as she feels its warmth wash over her "I will not stumble. I will not be broken. I will continue on, and nothing can stand in my way."

These words are not empty. They echo throughout her core and resonate with every fibre of her being. Her spirit livens as the warmth of the flame gives her just enough strength to keep from succumbing. This abyss may be a hostile, unforgiving place, but she knows that no matter what the darkness holds, it will never have the power to snuff out her most precious of flames. And as long as she has that, she will go on.

<br><br>
<span>
She takes a deep breath and raises her head, looking onward. It is a long, perilous journey. But she knows what lies at the end. And for that, she would walk this path until time itself stood still.
