## Story Integration

### Central Religious Authority & Artifact Guardianship
**Faith Integration**: The Order of Sages operates as a specialized division within **[[The Faith]]**, consisting of **seven individuals "entrusted with the protection and preservation of ancient artifacts, said to be handed down by Hylia herself."** Each Sage maintains **"their own order of Abbots"** who assist in preservation duties and administrative functions.

**Supernatural Jurisdiction**: The Order claims **authority over supernatural phenomena and magical artifacts**, as demonstrated in Chapter 31 when **[[Sage Chalia]]** demands **"immediate transfer of Ryn's pendant to Seeker custody."** This authority enables them to control access to dangerous magical resources and maintain security protocols.

### Historical Deception & Secret Knowledge
**Divine Truth Management**: The Order maintains **orthodox doctrine claiming [[Hylia]] still watches over her peoples** while secretly knowing of her ancient demise. This **"closely guarded secret"** prevents societal chaos while enabling **active [[Fae]] suppression** for fear that public knowledge would destabilize the kingdom.

**Theological Crisis Management**: The Order's dual role requires managing both **public religious doctrine** and **supernatural threat containment**, creating tension between maintaining social stability and addressing real cosmic dangers through organizations like the **[[Seekers]]**.

### Temple of Time Operations & Fae Containment
**Administrative Headquarters**: The **[[Temple of Time]]** serves as the Order's primary **base of operations**, housing leadership functions and serving as the coordination center for supernatural artifact management and religious doctrine enforcement.

**Historical Containment Role**: The Order has historically managed **[[Fae]]** imprisonment and containment, with the Temple of Time serving as a secure facility for dangerous supernatural entities. **[[Niesis]]**'s imprisonment there demonstrates their containment capabilities and security protocols.

### Chapter Appearances & Political Functions
**Chapter 31 Authority**: **Sage Chalia**'s demand for pendant custody demonstrates the Order's active involvement in **supernatural artifact collection and management**, showing their direct engagement with ongoing magical investigations and security protocols.

**Church-State Balance**: The Order's authority creates a **balance of power** that prevents either Faith or Crown from achieving absolute control over supernatural resources, though this creates tension in resource allocation and magical research permissions.

### Known Sage Members & Organizational Structure
**[[Hylian]] Sages**:
- **[[Sage Amaurath]]**: Ranking member whom **[[Zelda]] studied under for many years**, indicating educational and mentorship functions
- **[[Sage Kakaro]]**: Member with unspecified specialization
- **[[Sage Chalia]]**: Artifact management specialist handling security protocols

**Zora Sages** (from expanded data):
- **[[Sage Vulas]]**: Zora member indicating inter-racial cooperation
- **[[Sage Rutilo]]**: Zora member showing diversity in religious leadership

### Historical Context & Ancient Precedents
**Byrna Connection**: Historical data suggests the Order once operated from **[[Byrna]]**, where they **"possessed two shards of Wisdom"** and prepared defensive measures during the **[[Blin]]** invasion approximately 1000 years ago. This demonstrates their historical role in **crisis management** and **fragment protection**.

**Documentation Mission**: Their core mission involves **"preservation of historical knowledge and ancient artifacts"** while also seeking to **"document and detail current events,"** positioning them as both historians and active participants in supernatural crisis response.
