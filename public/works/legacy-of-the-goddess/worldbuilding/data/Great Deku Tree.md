## Story Integration

### Triforce Fragment Significance
**Wisdom Shard Bearer**: The Great Deku Tree's possession of a **[[Triforce of Wisdom]]** shard makes it a crucial strategic entity in the cosmic conflict, representing one of the divine fragments that must be considered in any comprehensive defense strategy against void entities.

**Fae Alliance Implications**: The bonding between a **[[Deku]]** and **[[Fae]]** entity creates a hybrid supernatural power structure that combines plant-based influence with divine fragment abilities, demonstrating the complex interactions possible between different supernatural entity types.

### Territorial Control & Threat Assessment
**Lost Woods Dominion**: Control over a "significant fraction of the **[[Lost Woods]]**" establishes the Great Deku Tree as a regional power that could affect movement through this strategic location, particularly given its isolation from global conflicts.

**Child Enthrallment Concern**: The pattern of **[[Hylian]]** children "who wander too far" falling under its dominion suggests either protective custody or more sinister recruitment, with the QM note about "growing Kokiri from Hylian children refugees" indicating potential population transformation.

### Strategic Isolation Policy
**Portal Vulnerability**: The note that it's "unlikely to make a move on the global stage unless assaulted via portal" suggests it maintains deliberate isolation from the cosmic conflicts, potentially making it either a neutral refuge or a defensive threat that must be approached carefully.

### Cross-References
- **[[Triforce of Wisdom]]**: Contains a crucial fragment of this divine artifact
- **[[Fae]]**: Bonded with a Fae entity, combining their supernatural abilities
- **[[Lost Woods]]**: Controls significant territory within this location
- **[[Hylian]]**: Target population for child enthrallment/recruitment
- **[[Deku]]**: Original species before supernatural enhancement

## Description
### About

Several centuries past, a massive [[Deku]] bonded with a [[Fae]] after happening upon a shard of the [[Triforce of Wisdom]]. With its power, this "Great Deku Tree" has managed to enthrall and enslave countless creatures, expanding its influence over a significant fraction of the [[Lost Woods]]. Notably, [[Hylian]] children who wander too far into the forest often find their way into his dominion.
