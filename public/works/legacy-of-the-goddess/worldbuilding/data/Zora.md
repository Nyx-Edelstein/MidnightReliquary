## Story Integration
### Narrative Role
The Zora represent the ancient guardians of cosmic balance, serving as protectors of dangerous void perpendicularity sites and bearers of ancient wisdom regarding supernatural threats. Their isolationist tendencies and magical abilities make them crucial but challenging allies in the cosmic conflict, while their cultural emphasis on longevity and careful deliberation contrasts with the urgency of current threats.

### Chapter Appearances & Context
- **Zelda's Dreams Investigation (Chapter A2)**: Golvara serves as the diplomatic intermediary when Zelda seeks to understand her prophetic visions, revealing Zora knowledge of "Ja'bu" and their role as guardians of ancient threats
- **Triforce Fragment Delivery (Chapter 30)**: Golvara delivers the fourth Wisdom fragment to Zelda, showing dramatic evolution from antagonistic to respectful recognition of her leadership, and discussing the dangerous infiltration mission to corrupted Zora Domain temple
- **Domain Corruption Crisis (Chapters 12-13)**: The attack on Zora's Domain by void entities represents a critical breach of their protective barriers, forcing the normally isolationist Zora to seek external alliance for survival
- **Lizalfos Conflict (Chapter 34)**: The ongoing territorial struggle between Zora and Lizalfos illustrates the ancient enmity between the races and the Zora's defensive capabilities through blue magic

### Cross-Reference Connections
- **Golvara Network**: As one of Shesan's marked operatives, Golvara connects Zora intelligence to the Shadow Dancers' multiverse monitoring mission, providing crucial supernatural threat assessment
- **Ja'bu Perpendicularity**: The Zora's guardianship of the void entity and perpendicularity at Ja'bu Cove demonstrates their role as cosmic barrier maintainers and their intimate knowledge of void threats
- **Blue Magic Mastery**: The Zora's natural affinity for Scry and Foretelling makes them invaluable for intelligence gathering and early warning systems against supernatural incursions
- **Triforce of Wisdom**: Nineve the Wise's possession of a Wisdom fragment and the Zora's ancient knowledge repository position them as keepers of cosmic understanding
- **Ancient Lightsworn Sites**: Golvara's responsibility for protecting temple facilities within Zora Domain reveals their historical connection to Lightsworn infrastructure and training grounds

### Canon Reconciliation
No conflicts detected between worldbuilding data and story canon. The Zora's role as ancient guardians, their isolationist nature forcing them into reluctant alliance during the crisis, their magical capabilities supporting intelligence operations, and their complex relationship with both cosmic threats and territorial conflicts all align consistently with established narrative frameworks. The evolution from Golvara's initial antagonism to respectful cooperation reflects realistic diplomatic progression under crisis conditions.

## Description
### Overview
* Created by [[Nayru]] at the behest of [[Farore]]
* Isolationist / Xenophobic
    * Significantly longer lived than most other races, viewing them as petulant, reckless, and immature (usually with good reason). Many Zora live to be over a thousand years old.
    * Generally content to keep to themselves and study the laws of magic and nature
    * Some mavericks still decide to travel and explore; usually keep nearby to rivers and lakes
* More spiritually attuned than other races, and prevalent natural affinity for [[Blue magic]]s -- high incidence, roughly one in ten
    * Make effective use of [[Scry]] and [[Foretelling]] to detect and defend their territory against invaders (usually [[Lizalfos]])
* Live simply and subsist entirely off of nature
* Do not worship [[Hylia]], though she is generally revered. Revere [[Nayru]] as their progenitor and as a paragon of their ideals, but do not worship her either. Instead, their faith is loosely based on ancestor worship, deifying and seeking to emulate those long past who were paragons of Zora culture and thought.
* Society is extremely egalitarian, with no real system of governance or societal classes. 
* Elders are respected for their knowledge and wisdom, and individuals are afforded fame and recognition based on merit.
* Due to their biology, they are not particularly keen with metallurgy and thus rely much more heavily on magic than on technology

### Location Lore
* Inhabit the [[Zora Basin]], and constantly guard a natural choke point (known as [[Zora's Pass]]) to keep their lands safe
* Natural enemies of [[Lizalfos]], who prey upon them. Lizalfos are not really a threat in the Domain due to extensive traps, chokepoints, and scrying-aided ambushes, but can be a real nuisance if travelling outside of the Domain

### History
* The Zora have taken it upon themselves to guard and protect a [[perpendicularity]] situated close to the basin, at [[Ja'bu Cove]]
    * [[Ja'bu]] is a massive fishlike void entity that managed to break through the perpendicularity many ages ago. It attacked [[Faron]] and managed to drive her mad. Ja'bu was fought back and sealed by the Zora (with the aid of Hylia) while it was weakened. Ever since, a sect of Zora have dedicated themselves to watching over the entity and ensuring the seals are maintained and that it does not reawaken. These Zora would sooner die than allow outsiders to gain knowledge of the perpendicularity's existence

### Important Characters
* [[Sage Rutilo]] of the Zora
* [[Sage Vulas]] of the Zora
* [[Nineve the Wise]] - oldest living Zora by a fair margin (~5000 years old)
    * May be a source of knowledge of the history of the world and the wider universe, though is exceptionally unlikely to want to divulge any information without earning her trust (-very- hard)
* [[Golvara]], a young and popular Zora leader and a devotee of [[Shesan]]
