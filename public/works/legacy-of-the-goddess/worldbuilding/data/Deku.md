## Story Integration

### Parasitic Threat Assessment & Strategic Implications
**Biological Warfare Potential**: Deku reproductive cycles pose sophisticated biological hazards through **spore-based infection systems that hijack nervous control while leaving consciousness intact**. The combination of **immune-suppressing gas attacks** and **neurological takeover** represents advanced biological warfare capabilities that could theoretically be weaponized or encountered during wilderness exploration.

**Territorial Isolation Effect**: Deku behavioral patterns **contribute to Lost Woods myths and legends**, creating natural deterrent effects that **keep travelers from venturing beyond outer reaches**. This isolation protects both Deku populations and provides strategic concealment for important locations within the forest.

### Great Deku Tree Strategic Significance
**Triforce Fragment Bearer**: The **[[Great Deku Tree]]**'s possession of a **[[Triforce of Wisdom]]** shard creates crucial strategic considerations—combining **Fae-bonded supernatural enhancement** with **divine fragment power** to control significant territory within the **[[Lost Woods]]**. This represents a **major power concentration** that could affect regional stability.

**Child Enthrallment Concern**: The pattern of **[[Hylian]]** children "who wander too far" becoming part of the Great Deku Tree's dominion suggests either **protective sanctuary operations** or **population recruitment mechanisms**. The QM note regarding "growing Kokiri from Hylian children refugees" indicates potential **transformation processes** requiring careful assessment.

**Portal Vulnerability Assessment**: Intelligence suggesting the Great Deku Tree is "unlikely to make a move on the global stage unless assaulted via portal" indicates **deliberate isolation from cosmic conflicts**, making it either a **neutral refuge zone** or a **defensive threat requiring diplomatic approach**.

## QM Data
### Overview
The Deku are a parasitic plant-based intelligence, often found in deep woods, jungles, or marshes. Not much is known about them, as they are fiercely territorial and extremely secretive. Upon encountering a threat, they will usually hide away until it passes by. However, if it lingers too long, or ventures too close to spawning grounds, they will attempt to attack it from afar with any means at their disposal (which may include throwing rocks or sharpened sticks, blowing darts, using poisons and biological weapons, etc.)

Deku inhabit and control the bodies of any creature they can manage to infect, by hijacking the more primitive and universal nervous systems which control automatic movement, base desires, and instinct. The creatures they are capable of controlling varies, and can range from large insects and small creatures, to monstrosities that lurk in the forgotten depths.

They are not particularly intelligent on their own -- or at least, their intelligence is sufficiently alien that other races do not recognize it. Usually their most complex behaviors are limited to things like herding and domesticating creatures for breeding and food, but if a collective manages to infect and control an intelligent individual (or an entire species!) they can be much more dangerous.

Generally, their host remains conscious and "in control", although the Deku can override physical movement, and has complete control over the host's desires and instincts. A sentient creature possessed by a Deku would experience euphoria when submitting to the Deku's wishes, and agonizing pain otherwise. They may even develop a sense of being guided by a higher power, and come to worship the Deku as gods.

They reproduce in a two-stage cycle:

1. First they release spores, which enter host's bodies through the respiratory system. Normally these would be destroyed, excised, or rendered inert by the host's immune system, but the Deku also release a noxious gas full of various chemical and biological agents which temporarily suppress the immune response. If a spore successfully latches onto a host (and it doesn't die from infection), it will slowly make its way to the host's head and burrow into their brain. From this point, the gestating spore will release various neurotoxins which alter the behavior of their host, causing it to want to travel back to the spawning pools (if it wasn't small enough to be subdued already).

2. Once there, the Deku Spore secretes more neurotoxins, causing the host to drift into a deep sleep. Nourished by the pools, the spore is able to sprout and take root. It grows thousands of tiny tendrils which permeate the host's hindbrain, spinal cord, and nervous system, as well as altering various biological processes. The whole process takes roughly a week before the sprout has gained sufficient control, during which mature Deku will keep the host alive.

While there are two primary modes they operate in that are akin to male and female in other species, Deku do not have clearly defined biological sex. Indeed, they will transition between male and female as is needed by the collective.

Deku adopt the feminine role by default. Female Deku are signified by a small pod surrounded by an elaborate flower rooted in the host's head. The use of the pod/flower varies between subspecies, but they usually produce and store various chemical and biological agents, and also serve to deliver fertilized spores. They often act as scouts, hunters, and patrols.

Masculine Deku are signified by a much larger carnivorous pod attached to a long stalk, with sprawling prehensile vines. Their primary role is to guard and tend to spawning pools. Males do not move often, and will usually consume their host as part of the transition to the male form. They require much more nourishment in this form, and rely on the females to bring a constant supply of food. Males also produce spores, which are activated by stimulating female Deku with their vines and depositing the spores into their pods. If food is scarce, males will revert to the female form (after adopting a new host), and the collective will seek out new areas.

### Location Lore
Deku thrive in deep jungles, overgrown swamps, and dense forests. In Hyrule, they make their home in the [[Lost Woods]], having developed natural affinities over the millennia that allow them to better navigate the ever-shifting spatial distortions caused by close proximity to a quasi-stable [[perpendicularity]].

There are hundreds of isolated spawning pools throughout the Lost Woods, with Deku clusters mostly keeping to themselves, although occasionally there is population crossover, and very rarely, conflict between clusters over scarce resources or prime breeding grounds. A few clusters are more centralized than others, being organized and coordinated by a singular powerful Deku, either in male form (having grown to considerable size) or in female form (having infected a particularly large or powerful creature).

The behavioral tendencies of the parasitic Deku, together with the spatial distortions caused by the aforementioned perpendicularity, have resulted in a variety of myths and legends surrounding the Lost Woods. Very few individuals are brave -- or stupid enough -- to travel much further than the outermost reaches of the Lost Woods, for fear of never returning. This has been the case for virtually all of recorded history.

### Important Characters
Most notably, the largest and most complex Deku cluster by far is guided and controlled by a singular massive male Deku that long ago bonded with a Fae, and later happened upon a shard of the [[Triforce of Wisdom]]. With its power, this “[[Great Deku Tree]]” has managed to enthrall and enslave countless creatures, and expand its influence over a significant fraction of the [[Lost Woods]]. Children who wander too far into the forest often find their way into his dominion.
