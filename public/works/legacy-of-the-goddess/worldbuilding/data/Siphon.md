## Story Integration

### Link's Siphon Mastery & Training Applications
**Chapter 10 Training Success**: Link demonstrates **instinctive competence** with **Siphon magic** during his **Red Magic training** with **[[Grenja]]**, successfully **drawing magical energy** from the veteran warrior through **physical contact**. **"Go on, try it on me now"** leads to **immediate success**, showing Link's **natural affinity** for **energy transfer techniques**.

**Team Resource Sharing**: **Siphon** proves **invaluable** for **team coordination** and **magical resource management** throughout the journey. **Link** routinely **redistributes magical energy** among party members, enabling **sustained magical operations** beyond individual capacity limits and providing **tactical flexibility** during extended encounters.

**Affinity-Based Mastery**: Link's **tri-affinity capabilities** combined with **Siphon proficiency** enable **efficient energy transfer** across **all magical types**, making him an **ideal conduit** for **team magical coordination** and **emergency power redistribution** during critical situations.

### Fi Avatar Immunity & Conversion Experiments
**Chapter 14/19 Reverse Conversion Tests**: **Zelda's journal** documents **failed experiments** attempting to **reverse Fi's power conversion** process through **Siphon magic**. **"Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work; her avatar can't be affected by Siphon. Both I and Cove tried, but neither of us felt any magic to pull from."**

**Divine Avatar Protection**: **Fi's intangible avatar** demonstrates **complete immunity** to **Siphon effects**, preventing **magical energy extraction** from **divine manifestations** and maintaining **entity power security**. This **immunity** protects **Fi's Divine Power reserves** from **accidental or intentional drainage**.

**Strategic Implications**: **Fi's Siphon immunity** creates **one-way power flow** where she can **replenish mortal reserves** but **cannot be depleted** through **standard magical techniques**, maintaining **sustainable power dynamics** and **preventing exploitation** of **divine energy sources**.

### Advanced Magical Testing & Barrier Interactions
**Chapter 16 Barrier Experiments**: **Siphon** proves **unaffected by magical barriers** that **block other abilities**, requiring **physical contact** through **barrier boundaries** but **functioning normally** once **contact established**. **"Siphon did not appear to be affected either—though it also required Link to stick a hand through, so no surprise there."**

**Physical Contact Requirements**: **Siphon's effectiveness** depends on **direct physical contact** rather than **magical projection**, making it **reliable** for **close-range energy transfer** but **limiting tactical applications** where **proximity** cannot be **safely maintained**.

**Magical Experimentation Framework**: **Siphon** serves as **baseline test** for **magical mechanics research**, providing **consistent results** for **comparative analysis** of **barrier effects**, **avatar interactions**, and **power transfer limitations**.

### Chapter 20/30 Strategic Applications
**Chapter 20 Resource Management**: **Koja's resistance** to **enhanced Siphon development** demonstrates **tactical tension** between **efficiency** and **emergency preparedness**. **"Can't you just keep using Siphon like you have been?"** versus **Link's desire** for **rapid power access** during **crisis situations**.

**Chapter 30 High-Level Magical Operations**: **Zelda's advanced experiments** require **exhausting local magical reserves** through **Siphon**, demonstrating **large-scale resource coordination** where **"The first batch of tests exhausted my own reserves and all those of the local mages via Siphon (including Cove and Laylith)."**

**Tactical Limitations**: **Siphon** proves **insufficient** for **highest-level magical operations** requiring **Fi's direct assistance**, with **"the possibility of using Siphon in the middle of the technique"** considered **impractical** due to **focus requirements** and **technique complexity**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Red Magic Classification**: **Siphon** represents **core Red Magic ability** demonstrating **Din's power** over **energy manipulation** and **resource redistribution**. The **magic-red** classification places this within **standard chromatic magic systems** accessible to **mortal practitioners** with **appropriate affinity**.

**Affinity-Based Mechanics**: **"Those with higher affinities have an easier time resisting or forcing a transfer"** creates **skill-based interaction system** where **magical competence** determines **transfer success rates** and **resistance effectiveness**, maintaining **strategic depth** in **energy management**.

**Non-Native Magic Access**: **"Allows transfer of magic the user is not natively sensitive to, but this magic dissipates quickly"** provides **temporary cross-affinity access** while preventing **permanent magical enhancement** beyond **natural capabilities**, maintaining **character specialization** boundaries.

**Concentration Dependency**: **"Losing concentration will interrupt the effect"** creates **vulnerability windows** during **energy transfer**, requiring **tactical positioning** and **protective measures** to ensure **successful magical redistribution** in **combat situations**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
A small fixed cost, plus opposed cost from target

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Attempt to siphon from or transfer MP to a target. The target may attempt to resist, increasing the cost by expending their own magic. Those with higher affinities have an easier time resisting or forcing a transfer.

If the target being siphoned is subdued or does not resist, there is no opposed cost. Losing concentration will interrupt the effect.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
10 + (Opposed Cost × Ratio of affinities between target and caster)

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Pay an upfront cost, and then siphon from or transfer MP to a target at a rate per second equal to the caster's affinity.

If the target being siphoned is subdued or does not resist, there is no opposed cost. Losing concentration will interrupt the effect.

Allows transfer of magic the user is not natively sensitive to, but this magic dissipates quickly and cannot be regenerated as normal.
