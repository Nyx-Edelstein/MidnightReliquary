## Description
**Classification**: Void Entity  
**Size**: Large  
**Diet**: Magic Energy  
**Environments**: Void Between Worlds, Infiltration Sites  

**About**:
These creatures originate from the **[[Void Between Worlds]]**, and feed off of magical energy drained from chromatic magic users and infrastructure. Wizkin are sentient beings with alien intelligence that makes meaningful communication nearly impossible despite their sophisticated ritual behaviors.

They appear as amorphous clouds of energy, usually bounded by garments resembling robes, maintaining vaguely humanoid shapes. Wizkin demonstrate complex supernatural organization through ritualistic dances and chanting, though their purposes remain incomprehensible to mortal scholars.

As **[[Old Magic]]** entities, Wizkin possess reality manipulation capabilities that operate outside normal magical limitations. They are exceptionally dangerous, often attacking magical practitioners on sight to drain their **[[Divine Energy]]** reserves.

## Story Integration

### Void Entity Classification & Threat Assessment
**Void-Native Status**: Wizkin represent **native Void entities** with access to **[[Old Magic]]** systems that predate creation. As beings that **"originate from the Void,"** they possess inherent abilities that operate outside normal chromatic magic limitations and represent direct threats from **[[Void Between Worlds]]** infiltration.

**Magic Feeding Mechanism**: Their **"feed off of magic"** nature positions them as **direct threats to chromatic mages** and magical infrastructure. Unlike standard creatures that consume physical matter, Wizkin drain the **[[Divine Energy]]** that powers **[[Red Magic]]**, **[[Blue Magic]]**, and **[[Green Magic]]** systems, potentially disrupting defensive capabilities.

**Sentient Alien Intelligence**: The description as **"sentient beings, although they are so alien that any sort of meaningful communication is all but impossible"** places Wizkin in a unique threat categoryâ€”intelligent enough for strategic behavior but completely incompatible with diplomatic solutions.

### Ritual Behavior & Supernatural Organization
**Complex Ritual Systems**: The observed **"complex rituals involving dances and chanting"** suggests Wizkin possess sophisticated supernatural practices that **"even the most learned scholars have been unable to discern."** These rituals may represent **[[Old Magic]]** applications, summoning procedures, or **[[Void Between Worlds]]** manipulation techniques.

**Group Coordination Capabilities**: The ritual behavior implies Wizkin can coordinate group activities, making them potentially capable of organized infiltration or coordinated attacks rather than mere individual encounters.

### Threat Level & Combat Implications
**Exceptional Danger Rating**: The assessment that Wizkin are **"exceptionally dangerous, often attacking on sight"** combined with their **Large size** and **void origin** positions them as **high-priority supernatural threats** requiring **[[Entity]]**-level containment or destruction approaches rather than standard creature management.

**Energy Form Vulnerabilities**: Their nature as **"amorphous clouds of energy, usually bounded by a garment resembling a robe"** suggests potential vulnerabilities to **[[Seal Entity]]** techniques or other **[[Old Magic]]** containment methods, though physical attacks may prove ineffective.

### Cross-References & Connections

- **[[Old Magic]]**: Native power system accessible to Void-born entities like Wizkin
- **[[Demise]]**: Primary Void entity whose cosmic threat may enable Wizkin infiltration
- **[[Entity]]**: Classification category for Void-native beings including Wizkin
- **[[Fae]]**: Corrupted divine fragments sharing Void exposure with similar alien characteristics
- **[[Guardian Beast]]**: Protective system designed to prevent Wizkin and similar Void infiltration
- **[[Perpendicularity]]**: Potential access points enabling Wizkin entry into reality

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Void Threat Consistency**: Wizkin align with established **[[Void Between Worlds]]** threat patterns, representing beings whose **alien nature and magical feeding** create existential dangers to magical infrastructure and practitioners. No contradictions with established story canon detected.

**Entity Classification Authority**: Following **SOURCE OF TRUTH** hierarchy, Wizkin classification as **void-native entities** with **Old Magic** access maintains consistency with **[[Magic]]** system distinctions between **Entity** and **[[Mage]]** capabilities.

**Threat Escalation Framework**: Wizkin's **"exceptionally dangerous"** rating and **"attack on sight"** behavior supports the narrative's escalating supernatural threat levels, providing context for why void entities pose existential rather than manageable dangers.
