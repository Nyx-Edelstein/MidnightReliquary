## Story Integration

### Fi's Unique Conversion Capability
**Hylia-Granted Ability**: The **QM Notes** specify that **"Fi is the only Entity capable of this, aside from Hylia, who granted the ability to her,"** establishing this as **exclusive divine prerogative** rather than **learnable technique**. This reinforces **[[Fi]]'s** **special status** as **Hylia's designated agent** with **unique magical authorities**.

**Chapter 19 Strategic Considerations**: **Zelda's journal** explores the **practical implications** of **power conversion**, noting that **developing magical research** would require **"on the order of 10,000 to 100,000 Divine Power"** to **"work out a way to continuously channel the effect."** This suggests **Convert Magic** could be **enhanced** through **[[Research Magic]]** applications.

**Resource Management Applications**: The ability to **convert between power types** enables **tactical flexibility** during **extended operations** where **specific energy types** become **depleted**. **Chapter 14** experiments with **reverse conversion** through **[[Siphon]]** magic demonstrate **ongoing research** into **power optimization**.

### Magical System Boundaries
**Old Magic Restrictions**: The **"Magic Power cannot be used for Fi's abilities or Old Magic"** limitation maintains **fundamental distinction** between **chromatic magic systems** and **entity capabilities**. This prevents **converted Magic Power** from **circumventing** the **Entity vs. Mage** **power hierarchy**.

**One-Way Conversion Barrier**: While **Fi** can **convert** between **power types**, **converted Magic Power** remains **incompatible** with **her native abilities**, creating **strategic trade-offs** where **power conversion** reduces **Fi's direct capabilities** while **enhancing** **marked individuals'** **chromatic magic** access.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Fi-Exclusive Classification**: The **magic-fi** tag and **exclusive capability** reinforce **Fi's unique position** within the **magical hierarchy**. This ability serves as **bridge** between **Old Magic** and **chromatic systems** without **compromising** **system distinctiveness**.

**Time Cost Scaling**: **"One hour per 10 Void Power or 10 Magic Power expended"** creates **significant time investment** for **meaningful conversions**, preventing **casual power manipulation** while enabling **strategic preparation** for **extended campaigns**.

**Efficiency Loss**: **15% conversion cost** represents **energy loss** inherent in **cross-system transformation**, maintaining **resource scarcity** while providing **tactical flexibility** during **emergency situations**.

## Description
**VP/MP Cost**:
15% of power type being converted

**Time Cost**:
One hour per 10 Void Power or 10 Magic Power expended

**Description**:
Convert 1 Void Power to 1 Magic Power, or 1 Magic Power to 1 Void Power

Magic Power cannot be used for Fi's abilities or Old Magic.

**Bidirectional Conversion**: **1:1 ratio** between **Void Power** and **Magic Power** provides **direct equivalency** for **energy planning** while **15% overhead** ensures **conversion** carries **meaningful cost** rather than **free transformation**.

**System Compatibility**: **Converted Magic Power** functions **identically** to **naturally generated** energy for **chromatic magic applications**, enabling **marked individuals** to **exceed natural capacity** through **Fi's power conversion**.

**Old Magic Barrier**: **Restriction** preventing **converted Magic Power** from **powering Fi's abilities** maintains **entity capability distinctiveness** and prevents **power multiplication loops** through **conversion cycling**.

**QM Notes**:
Fi is the only Entity capable of this, aside from Hylia, who granted the ability to her.
