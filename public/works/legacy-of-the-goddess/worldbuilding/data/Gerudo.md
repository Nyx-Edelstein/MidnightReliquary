## Story Integration
### Narrative Role
The Gerudo serve as a critical cultural and political element representing the complex consequences of desperation, manipulation, and the cyclical nature of oppression. Their dark history under Morudo Geira's influence establishes the backstory for both Ganondorf's origins and the current Sunseeker faction's alliance with Hyrule, while their ongoing civil unrest and raiding activities create immediate diplomatic and military challenges.

### Chapter Appearances & Context
- **Naibi Alliance (Chapters 10-15)**: The Sunseeker faction under Naibi's leadership represents the path toward redemption and integration, negotiating alliance with Zelda and eventually being granted baroness status and fertile lands
- **Ganondorf's Origin Story (Chapters 11-13)**: The revelation that Ganondorf became the "King Among Kings" by slaying Morudo Geira's avatar and ending the blood sacrifice system, only to later be corrupted by Demise and fall into tyranny
- **Obsidian Spire Discovery (Chapter 16)**: The team's exploration of Morudo Geira's former binding site, where they discover the massive avatar remains and understand the scale of the entity that once controlled Gerudo society
- **Diplomatic Integration (Chapters 19, 28)**: Ongoing negotiations and cultural exchange between Zelda and Naibi, with discussions of Gerudo language learning, cultural unification, and Naibi's potential diplomatic missions to other races
- **Historical Context (Chapter 5)**: References to the Gerudo Wars and their role in the broader pattern of Fae manipulation and void entity influence over various cultures

### Cross-Reference Connections
- **Morudo Geira Legacy**: The void entity's centuries-long manipulation of Gerudo culture through the Geiran cult, creating a systematic child sacrifice system disguised as cultural purity rituals
- **Ganondorf's Corruption Arc**: His transformation from liberator (slaying Geira and ending the sacrifices) to tyrant (corrupted by Demise and leading to civil war and exile)
- **Naibi's Network**: Her role as one of Shesan's marked operatives, connecting Gerudo intelligence to the Shadow Dancers' multiverse monitoring mission
- **Current Raiding Crisis**: The breakdown of traditional Gerudo society following Geira's death, leading to uncoordinated raids and the "no prisoners" military policy, contrasted with the Sunseekers' peaceful integration
- **Triforce Connections**: Multiple Gerudo leaders (Ganondorf, Ibboso) as Triforce fragment bearers, with the Obsidian Spire serving as a Lightsworn training ground

### Canon Reconciliation
The worldbuilding data aligns perfectly with story canon. The complex history of void entity manipulation, the systematic child sacrifice system, Ganondorf's heroic origins followed by corruption, and the current split between raiding factions and the peaceful Sunseekers are all consistently portrayed. The cultural trauma from centuries of Geira's manipulation provides realistic justification for the ongoing civil unrest and the difficulty of unifying the tribes. Naibi's integration as a baroness represents hope for eventual cultural healing and unity.

## Description
### Overview
The Gerudo are semi-nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, who have adapted to life in the southwestern mesa, desert and coastal areas. The term "Gerudo" is more of a cultural label than a racial one, as they are genetically [[Hylian]]s, having split apart a mere seven-hundred years ago. Still, due to heavy cultural and environmental selection, the Gerudo are quite physically dissimilar to their Hylian counterparts, being darker skinned and a good deal taller and heartier on average.

Also, they are almost entirely female.

This is quite a perplexing fact, to be sure. Hylian stories say that a Gerudo male is only born once every hundred years, and is ordained by Gerudo law to become their king. But as one might surmise, the extreme prevalence of females to males among the Gerudo population could not possibly be due to any quirk of genetics. Rather, it is a result of truly sinister cultural and religious practices; the truth of which is a dark secret known only to the inner sects of the [[Geiran]].

Over a thousand years ago, and without warning, [[Hylia]] withdrew her presence from the kingdom of Hyrule, and her protections began to wane. Not long thereafter, the eastern plains were ravaged by the [[Blin]] Invasion, leaving millions dead and the majority of the kingdom in ruin. In the ensuing chaos before [[the Reaffirmation]], belief spread that Hylia had betrayed her people. Even as the [[Sages]] held fast to the old faith, a group of separatists formed around the idea that it was necessary to seek out a "New Goddess" for any hope of protection or future prosperity.

They did not have to search for long.

Far to the south, hidden away through a mountain pass at the edge of [[the Shifting Sands]], they came upon a great temple. Deep inside, they heard the whispers of an entity long-forgotten: one known as [[Morudo Geira]]. Geira heard their call, and was more than willing to play the part. A cult of worship quickly grew around this new "Goddess," calling themselves the Gerudo.

Initially the Gerudo were, if not accepted, at least tolerated amongst the Hylians. However, as the years passed, the group spread, all the while becoming ever more insular and secretive. Rumors spread of dark rituals, evil magics, and even of human sacrifices to their new goddess. At the behest of the [[Shiekah]], it was not long before King [[Domhall Gavrillius Hyrule II]] gathered together an army to expel the Gerudo from Hylian lands.

The Gerudo, guided by their namesake, were of course prepared for this eventuality. They enacted a coup against the Royal family, and succeeded in taking the King's life, as well as that of his wife and two daughters. Twelve years of bloody civil war followed, as the Gerudo attempted to seize control and quell all dissent. The king's nephew and only surviving heir, [[Basilius Rhomar Hyrule]], took up the crown and command of the armies to avenge his uncle and oust the usurpers.

Just as it seemed the Gerudo would triumph, a champion arose, apparently bearing Hylia's blessing, and rallied the scattered Hylian forces. The Gerudo, being outmatched and outnumbered, were eventually defeated and forced to retreat to the southern mesas. They would not surrender, however, and entrenched themselves in the mountains and bluffs. There they resumed the fight, with continual skirmishes and raids along the southern border by the Gerudo, and occasional forays into the mesas lead by foolhardy Hylians.

[[Morudo Geira]] was of course unsatisfied with her subjects' failure, and she quickly shed her veneer of amenity and grace. While she would not dare to show any weakness to her subjects, she had expended great power in protecting them against "Hylia's" assault, and believed herself to be vulnerable to direct attacks from the far greater being. In her haste and urgency, she demanded blood sacrifice in exchange for continued protection, and threatened her subjects with annihilation if they would not sate her needs.

(In actuality, the Hylian provenance came not from [[Hylia]], but from a [[Fae]] named [[Lucia]] acting in Hylia's name. Geira eventually learned of this fact, but rather than risk any further confrontations, she made a pact with Lucia to gain power over the Fae in exchange for a binding agreement not to directly interfere again in this realm.)

The Gerudo, terrified by the certainty of Geira's wrath, battered and defeated in battle, and having no hope or future otherwise, were forced to acquiesce to her demands. A dark bargain was struck; the Gerudo would give to her all male children (retaining only a fraction as was necessary for propagation), and in exchange, Morudo Geira would grant them relative prosperity in the harsh desert lands, and continued protection from outside forces.

This was, however, not the most stable of arrangements, as all but the most devout followers could not stomach having their precious baby boys carted off like chattel. After a few months and countless suicides, desertion attempts, and failed rebellions, it was clear this practice could not be sustained. It was then that the closest and most devout followers of Geira -- calling themselves the Geiran -- met with their patron, and together they devised a most horrendous scheme.

It was decided that knowledge of Morudo Geira would be systematically erased from the tribe's cultural memory, with only the inner sect knowing the truth. Worship of Geira would be slowly replaced with worship of a generic ideal; the "Heroine of the Desert and Sands." Rather than their arrangement being seen as making sacrifices, a new cultural identity would be created for the people. The younger generations would be kept insulated from the old, and would be brainwashed with ideals of strength, unity, and supremacy of the Gerudo above all others.

At birth, males would be closely inspected for "weaknesses." Any boy who cried too much, or had visible blemishes or bumps, or who was too small, or was otherwise deemed unsatisfactory in any way, would be "discarded" to "keep the Gerudo blood pure." Mothers would accede to this practice willingly; any woman who protested too loudly would have the opportunity to plead her case before the tribe matriarchs, and most would be offered the chance to trade money, goods, or property -- as well as her reputation within the tribe -- to keep her child. Even so, most would not make the trade. Only two in five boys would make it through this selection process.

...But that was not enough for Geira.

Once every year, from their sixth birthday to their fourteenth, boys would be pitted against each other in a contest of strength and endurance, with the defeated being "exiled" from the tribe for the crime of weakness. Mothers and family would be allowed a week to grieve and say their farewells, but were expected to uphold the tribe laws, upon punishment of death.

...And yet this still was not enough.

Past their fourteenth birthday and as a coming-of-age rite, tribal law would mandate that all males make a journey across the sands of the Wastes. There, they would live for another four years, and before they could be accepted back into the tribe, they were to bring back incontrovertible proof of their strength and purity; proof that their blood was truly worthy of the Gerudo.

Upon their return, they would be hailed as kings, and would be awarded the rights of Sovereignty and Seed. It would then be their duty to pass on their blood, mating with every woman of childbearing age within their dominion. So too, would it be every woman's sacred duty to join with her king, to aspire to the ideal of the Heroine of the Desert and Sands, and to raise at least one woman to take her place before she became barren. Mothers of Kings would also be celebrated for their purity, and would live a life of luxury and ease. Further, any woman who did not raise at least one child to adulthood before becoming barren would also be "exiled," as were the weak, chronically ill, and infirm.

…Of course, this was all a sham orchestrated by Geira and her inner sect. In truth, the practice was only ever a careful balancing act, meant to sacrifice the greatest number of lives to Geira, so that she would be appeased and continue to uphold her end of the bargain.

After a couple generations, when at last the new culture took root, the Gerudo people sued for peace with the [[Hylian]]s. They forged a deal to make payments of reparation over the next twenty years, and in return the Hylians agreed to cease the ongoing hostilities, to formally recognize the Gerudo as a sovereign nation, and to cede to them all lands south of [[Last Bastion]].

This relationship between the Gerudo and the Hylians has remained steady over the last 700 years, but has always been tenuous at best. While some limited trade between the groups takes place, they are almost entirely segregated, both culturally and geographically. The Gerudo are looked upon as savages and are generally not permitted in Hylian lands without escort, while Hylians are viewed as weak and frail by the Gerudo -- barely worthy of their attention. (And to be sure, it would be a different story entirely if the Hylians did not so massively outnumber the Gerudo...)

It was somewhat surprising, then, when a few months ago Gerudo raiding parties began sacking smaller villages in the south, evading patrols by making their pass through the mountains. As far as anyone can tell, the groups are uncoordinated, and have no connection to any governing body within the Gerudo nation. The Hylians have attempted to make demands of the Gerudo to reign in their renegade counterparts, threatening retaliation and sending captured raiders back with such messages, but to no avail. Additionally, no Hylian messengers or scouting parties have returned from the desert.

As the raids have become increasingly more frequent and emboldened, and makeshift prison camps have been filled to capacity, it is currently Hylian military policy to engage any Gerudo parties on sight and to take no prisoners.
