## Story Integration

### Entity Communication Framework
**Cross-Dimensional Entity Contact**: **Speak to Entity** enables **direct telepathic communication** with **supernatural entities** across **Material Plane** distances, providing **strategic coordination** capabilities for **entity networks** and **diplomatic contact** with **isolated entities**.

**Shesan's Void Entity Communication**: **Chapter 31** reveals **Shesan** employs **entity communication techniques** to **locate and contact void entities**: **"The particular trick I used is already delicate and sensitive enough."** Her warning that **"it's a two-way connection. Establishing it alerts them to my presence and gives them information about me and my intentions"** demonstrates the **mutual awareness** created through **entity communication**.

**Strategic Intelligence Applications**: The ability to **contact entities** at **known binding locations** or **avatar positions** provides **intelligence gathering** opportunities and **tactical coordination**, though the **two-way information exchange** creates **operational security risks** for the communicator.

### Communication Requirements Analysis
**Same Plane Limitation**: The **"must be on the same plane"** restriction confines **entity communication** to **entities manifesting** in the **Material Plane** or **sharing dimensional access** with the caster, preventing **direct contact** with **entities** in **sealed dimensions** or **separate realities**.

**Entity Identification Protocol**: **"Must have some description of who/what they are"** requires **prior knowledge** or **encounter history** with the **target entity**, preventing **random entity scanning** but enabling **follow-up communication** after **established contact**. The **"significant interaction"** alternative provides **relationship-based targeting**.

**Location Knowledge Requirement**: **"Must have some knowledge of where they are"** enables **targeting** through **binding site knowledge** or **avatar location awareness**, creating **strategic value** for **entity tracking** and **containment monitoring**. This explains how **Seeker operations** could **monitor sealed entities** or **coordinate containment efforts**.

### Tactical Communication Mechanics
**Complexity-Based Cost Structure**: **"Complexity of Message"** scaling with **fixed 10000 complexity bound** enables **detailed entity communication** without **prohibitive costs**, supporting **extended negotiations** and **complex coordination** between **entities** and **advanced practitioners**.

**Speed of Light Transmission**: **"Roughly Instant (~speed of light)"** provides **near-instantaneous communication** across **planetary distances**, enabling **real-time tactical coordination** and **emergency contact** during **crisis situations**.

**Avatar vs. Binding Targeting**: The **QM Notes** clarify that **"knowledge of the location of where the entity is bound, or where their permanent avatar is"** provides **multiple targeting vectors**, enabling **communication** even when **entities** maintain **multiple manifestations** or **hidden primary forms**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Old Magic Classification**: As **old-magic-ability**, **Speak to Entity** represents **pre-creation communication techniques** accessible to **entities** and **advanced void practitioners** but not **standard chromatic mages**. This maintains **Entity vs. Mage** distinction while enabling **cross-entity coordination**.

**Planar Restriction Logic**: **Same plane requirement** prevents **trivial contact** with **sealed entities** or **cross-dimensional threats**, maintaining **dimensional barrier integrity** while enabling **Material Plane entity networking**.

**Two-Way Information Risk**: The **mutual awareness** created by **entity communication** mirrors **[[Shesan]]'s warning** about **"two-way connections"** that **alert targets** to **communicator presence**, creating **strategic risk-benefit calculations** for **entity contact operations**.

**Complexity Bound Framework**: The **fixed 10000 complexity** enables **sophisticated entity dialogue** without **escalating costs**, supporting **diplomatic negotiations** and **strategic planning** between **entities** with **vast intelligence differences**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Complexity of Message

**Time Cost**:
Roughly Instant (~speed of light)

**Description**:
Speak telepathically to another entity. The complexity bound for this purpose is always fixed at 10000.

<u>Requirements:</u>
1. Must be on the same plane
2. Must have some description of who/what they are
3. Must have some knowledge of where they are
**QM Notes**:
For the purposes of (3), it is sufficient to have knowledge of the location of where the entity is bound, or where their permanent avatar is. Also sufficient for (2) is to have had significant interaction with them.
