## Story Integration

### Fae Binding & Containment Examples
**Failed Manipulation Case Study**: Amadera represents a **critical example** of **Fae containment effectiveness** and **species resistance** to supernatural influence. Her **"marginal success in influencing"** [[Lizalfos]] and **reputation as "evil demon"** demonstrates that some species possess **natural resistance to Fae manipulation**, contrasting with more successful Fae like [[Genazede]] who established beneficial relationships with [[Lynel]] worshippers.

**Lizalfos Cultural Integration**: The fact that her silver coin is **"occasionally traded amongst (or stolen by) [[Lizalfos]] of the southern peninsula"** suggests **active Lizalfos commerce networks** and **cultural exchange patterns** in southern territories beyond the [[River Hylia]] populations encountered in Chapter 34.

### Canonical Positioning & Cross-References
**Geographic Alignment**: The **"southern peninsula"** location places Amadera in the **extended Lizalfos territorial range** beyond current story encounters, providing evidence for **broader Lizalfos civilization distribution** than Chapter 34's cult-corrupted population represents.

**Fae Hierarchy Context**: Amadera's **struggles with Lizalfos resistance** positions her among the **less powerful contained Fae** entities, unlike major figures such as [[Lucia]], [[Niesis]], or [[Cyrae]] who demonstrated significant influence over their targets.

### Cross-References & Connections
- **[[Lizalfos]]**: Natural resistance to Fae manipulation, southern territorial distribution
- **[[Fae]]**: Example of contained/struggling entity, binding effectiveness demonstration  
- **[[Genazede]]**: Contrasting example of successful Fae-species worship relationship
- **[[Cyrae]]**: Historical example of effective Fae manipulation for comparison
- **Southern Peninsula**: Geographic region indicating extended Lizalfos territories

## Description
### About

A [[Fae]] bound to a silver coin that is occasionally traded amongst (or stolen by) [[Lizalfos]] of the southern peninsula. She has had only marginal success in influencing the creatures, and is more often than not regarded as an evil demon by her would-be servitors.

**Binding & Containment**: Amadera's confinement to a **portable silver coin** represents a **successful Seeker containment operation**, limiting her influence to whoever possesses the artifact while preventing broader territorial corruption. Her binding method contrasts with other Fae containment approaches like [[Cyrae]]'s spear imprisonment or [[Nahira]]'s cave sealing.

**Species Resistance Patterns**: The **Lizalfos rejection of Amadera's influence** and their **perception of her as "evil demon"** demonstrates that some intelligent species possess **natural supernatural resistance** or **cultural immunity** to Fae manipulation. This resistance may relate to the **Lizalfos evolutionary psychology** emphasizing **deception detection** and **manipulation resistance** described in their species profile.

**Geographic Distribution Evidence**: References to **"southern peninsula"** Lizalfos populations indicate **extended territorial ranges** beyond the **[[River Hylia]]** and **[[Hylia's Watch]]** monitoring zones, suggesting **multiple distinct Lizalfos civilizations** with varying cultural development levels and potential **cult corruption exposure patterns**.
