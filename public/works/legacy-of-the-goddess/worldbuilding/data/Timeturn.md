## Story Integration

### Mythical Temporal Magic Status
**Lost Since Majora's Assault**: **Timeturn** represents **mythical temporal manipulation** that has **not been demonstrated since Majora's assault on the Golden Realm**. This **legendary technique** exists only in **ancient magical theory** and **historical references** to **pre-catastrophe divine capabilities**.

**No Contemporary Demonstration**: **Timeturn** has **never been witnessed in the current story** and remains **purely theoretical** within **modern magical practice**. The **absence of temporal manipulation** in **crisis situations** suggests **complete loss** of **this divine technique** following **cosmic-level disruptions**.

**Theoretical Framework Preservation**: **Ancient texts** and **magical theory** preserve **Timeturn's conceptual framework** through **Green Magic temporal foundations**, but **practical implementation** remains **beyond current capabilities** even with **Triforce fragment enhancement** or **divine empowerment**.

### Connection to Lost Divine Era
**Pre-Majora Capabilities**: **Timeturn** likely represents **Golden Goddesses-era magic** accessible to **cosmic entities** before **Majora's assault** **severed divine connections** and **disrupted fundamental magical systems**. The technique's **loss** symbolizes **broader degradation** of **ultimate magical arts**.

**Triforce Fragment Echoes**: While **[[Link]]'s resurrection mechanics** through **[[Triforce of Courage]]** demonstrate **limited temporal effects**, these represent **pale echoes** of **true Timeturn capabilities** rather than **authentic temporal manipulation**. **Fragment powers** provide **death reversal** without **universal timeline alteration**.

**Historical Divine Power**: **[[Hylia]]'s ancient empowerment** may have **theoretically included Timeturn access**, but **contemporary divine manifestations** lack **temporal manipulation components**, confirming **technique's loss** to **modern supernatural practice**.

### Theoretical Applications & Impossibility
**Ultimate Crisis Intervention**: **Timeturn** would theoretically enable **catastrophic event prevention**, **timeline revision**, and **reality-threatening crisis resolution**, but **exponential cost requirements** and **lost implementation knowledge** render **practical application impossible**.

**Mythical Resource Requirements**: The **exponential cost structure** (12,500 × 2^x MP) represents **theoretical calculations** for **universe-scale temporal manipulation** that **exceed any contemporary magical capacity**, even with **complete Triforce assembly** or **maximum divine enhancement**.

**Academic Interest Only**: **Timeturn** maintains **historical significance** as **ultimate Green Magic expression** and **theoretical temporal sovereignty**, but serves **research purposes** rather than **practical magical planning** in **current cosmic conflict**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Green Magic Hierarchy**: As **ultimate divine magic** technique, Timeturn represents **Green Magic's cosmic potential** beyond **standard healing** and **probability enhancement**. The **divine-magic classification** maintains **Green Magic identity** while acknowledging **transcendent power requirements**.

**Triforce Integration Logic**: **Temporal manipulation** aligns with **[[Triforce of Courage]]** death-reversal capabilities and **[[Triforce of Power]]** reality-alteration potential, suggesting **complete Triforce** or **extensive fragment collection** enables **Timeturn accessibility**.

**Fi's Divine Heritage**: **[[Fi]]'s** classification as **Master Sword spirit** with **divine empowerment** capabilities suggests **potential Timeturn access** during **maximum divine power expenditure**, though **12,500+ MP requirement** exceeds **standard operational reserves**.

**Narrative Constraint Framework**: **"No mortal has ever witnessed the effects"** maintains **story balance** by preventing **casual temporal manipulation** while establishing **theoretical accessibility** for **ultimate crisis scenarios** requiring **universe-scale intervention**.

## Description
**Type**: Mythical Temporal Magic  
**Status**: Lost since Majora's assault on the Golden Realm  
**Theoretical Cost**: 12,500 × 2^x (where x = hours reversed)

**Mythical Description**:
**Timeturn** represents **legendary temporal manipulation** that theoretically enabled **universal time reversal** while **preserving caster memories** of **original timeline events**. This **ultimate Green Magic expression** has been **lost to practical implementation** since **Majora's cosmic assault** **severed divine connections** and **disrupted fundamental magical systems**.

**Historical Capabilities**: **Ancient texts** suggest **Timeturn** functioned as **reality anchor** where **caster became temporal constant** maintaining **causality continuity** during **universal chronological revision**. **All events** within **reversed timeframe** would become **null and void** except within **caster's preserved memory**.

**Theoretical Detection**: **High magical affinity individuals** would theoretically experience **metaphysical discomfort** when interacting with **timeline manipulators**, providing **quantum-level temporal awareness** for **entities** and **advanced practitioners** sensitive to **chronological alterations**.

**Impossibility Confirmation**: **Exponential cost structure** combined with **lost implementation knowledge** renders **Timeturn** **purely academic** within **contemporary magical practice**. Even **complete Triforce assembly** likely lacks **sufficient power** for **meaningful temporal manipulation** given **degraded divine infrastructure**.

**Exponential Scaling**: **Cost doubling** per additional hour creates **absolute practical limitations** where even **four-hour reversals** require **200,000 MP**, ensuring **Timeturn** remains **ultimate contingency** rather than **tactical option**.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
12,500 × 2^x

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Revert time by x hours by the perspective of the source of the ability. The user of the ability retains all memories of events transpired.

**QM Notes**:
Those with particularly high magical affinities may feel a sense of discomfort when interacting with the user, especially if they were involved in the same events or were in close physical proximity to the user.
