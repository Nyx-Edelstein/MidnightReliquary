## Story Integration

### Tragic Extinction & Guardian Beast Failure
**Eldin's Protection Failure**: The **massacre of the Rito people represents a critical failure in the guardian beast system**, demonstrating that even powerful protective entities can be deceived by malicious forces. **[[Eldin]]** the dragon's inability to prevent their slaughter **despite dedicated protection efforts** shows the limitations of individual guardian entities against sophisticated threats.

**Malicious Entity Strategic Strike**: The **deliberate targeting of Rito "just to spite" Eldin** suggests **calculated psychological warfare** against guardian beasts, using protected populations as leverage to inflict emotional trauma on their protectors. This tactic represents sophisticated understanding of guardian psychology and attachment vulnerabilities.

**Isolation Response Effect**: Following the Rito extinction, **Eldin's complete isolation of the [[Eye of Din]]** demonstrates how traumatic loss can transform protective instincts into **absolute exclusion policies**, preventing both threats and legitimate visitors from accessing crucial locations and information.

### Triforce Fragment Legacy & Lost Knowledge
**Courage Shard Heritage**: **A Rito received a [[Triforce of Courage]] shard when the Ancient Hero died**, indicating their people had some **connection to heroic virtues or divine favor**. The shard **came to adorn a staff held by their Elder Chief** and was **used ceremoniously in coming-of-age rituals**, showing sophisticated spiritual traditions.

**Lost Strategic Resource**: The ceremonial staff **now lays forgotten somewhere within the Eye of Din**, representing **lost strategic value** as both a Triforce fragment and potential **key to awakening or communicating with Eldin**. Recovery of this artifact could provide crucial intelligence about fragment locations.

**Cultural Integration Loss**: The **reduction to "legend and myth"** represents **significant cultural knowledge loss** about their society, traditions, and potential contributions to regional stability. Their **hippie culture of singing, dancing, and recreational activities** suggests they may have provided cultural balance to the region's military tensions.

### Physical Characteristics & Lifestyle Adaptation
**Thermal Gliding Specialization**: **Half the size of [[Hylian]]s with low-density bones and three-meter wingspan**, Rito were **adapted for thermal gliding rather than powered flight**. Their **exclusive residence around the Eye of Din active volcano** suggests **specialized adaptation to volcanic thermal conditions** for optimal gliding performance.

**Peaceful Cultural Focus**: Description as **"hippie bird-people who lounged around singing, dancing, and doing drugs all day"** indicates they were **non-aggressive, culturally-focused society** that likely provided **artistic and spiritual contributions** rather than military or economic power to regional dynamics.

### Cross-References & Connections
- **[[Eldin]]**: Dragon guardian beast who failed to protect the Rito and now maintains absolute isolation
- **[[Eye of Din]]**: Volcanic region where Rito lived and where their ceremonial Triforce staff remains lost
- **[[Triforce of Courage]]**: Divine fragment once held in Rito ceremonial traditions
- **[[Guardian Beast]]**: System that failed to prevent Rito extinction despite dedicated protection
- **[[The Ancient Hero]]**: Death triggered Triforce fragmentation that led to Rito receiving a Courage shard
- **[[Perpendicularity]]**: Cosmic phenomenon at Eye of Din that Eldin guards and Rito once lived near
- **[[Hylian]]**: Size comparison reference for understanding Rito physical characteristics

**Note**: *Rito extinction creates permanent loss of this cultural and strategic resource, though their Triforce fragment heritage may still be recoverable through negotiation with Eldin.*

## Description
### Overview
The Rito were a race of hippie bird-people who lounged around singing, dancing, and doing drugs all day. They were about half the size of [[Hylian]]s, with low-density bones and a three-meter wingspan. They couldnâ€™t fly so much as glide, though made good use of thermals to gain and maintain height. They lived almost exclusively around the [[Eye of Din]], an active volcano. 

The dragon [[Eldin]], a guardian beast charged with protection of the world, defends a perpendicularity centered at the Eye of Din. He once took it upon himself to defend the Rito people in the absence of [[Hylia]] to protect them, but failed to do so when <s>they got eaten by a grue because there was already enough going on in this world already and Vecht couldn't find a way to work them into the worldbuilding</s> a malicious entity slipped past his guard and ruthlessly slaughtered his charges just to spite him. Since then, knowledge of the Rito have waned into legend and myth. Now, no traveler or beast enters the Eye of Din without his approval, and he never approves.
