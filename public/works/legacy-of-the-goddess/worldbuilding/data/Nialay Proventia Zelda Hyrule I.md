### Royal Naming Convention Connection
**Legacy Naming Pattern**: The full name "Nialay Proventia Zelda Hyrule I" establishes the **"Proventia"** middle name tradition that continues in the current royal line, with **Queen Zelda Numenia Proventia Hyrule** carrying this ancestral designation. This demonstrates the deep historical continuity of the royal bloodline and naming customs.

**Zelda Name Significance**: As the first ruler to combine both "Zelda" and "Hyrule" in her royal title, Nialay Proventia Zelda Hyrule I represents the origin point of the specific naming pattern that designates Hylia's divine bloodline within the royal succession.

### Historical Context & Political Precedent
**Founding of Farwatch (5888 AC)**: According to the Timeline, Nialay Lensa was **"a prominent Lightsworn and direct descendant of Hylia"** who **"secedes and establishes the Queendom of Farwatch"** during political turmoil, crowning herself as Nialay Proventia Zelda Hyrule I.

**Political Significance**: Her secession and establishment of an independent queendom demonstrates historical precedent for divine bloodline holders asserting independent sovereignty, which provides context for current Queen Zelda's political authority and legitimacy claims.
