## Description
**PLACEHOLDER - Critical cosmic event**: The destruction and shattering of the goddess Hylia by Demise, resulting in divine fragments scattered across the Void Between Worlds and the creation of Fae entities.

## Story Integration
**Canonical Context**: Hylia's Demise represents the central theological catastrophe that shaped the current crisis. Referenced throughout the story as the moment when divine protection failed and the Triforce fragments were scattered, creating the current supernatural landscape.

**Chapter 32 Revelation**: Through Lucia's exposition, this event is revealed as the origin point for all Fae entities, as Hylia's divine fragments were "scattered across the Void Between Worlds" where "most have been corrupted through prolonged exposure" to void conditions.

**Timeline Significance**: This event marks the transition from the age of direct divine protection to the current era where mortal champions must bear the responsibility of cosmic defense through Triforce fragment stewardship.

## Canonical Reconciliation
**Divine Succession**: Hylia's destruction necessitated the empowerment of mortal bloodlines (Zelda as reincarnation/heir) to maintain cosmic protection systems, explaining the story's emphasis on divine heritage and chosen champions.

**Fragment Distribution**: The scattering of Hylia's essence explains both the existence of beneficial Fae like Lucia and the random distribution of Triforce fragments across the world, creating the quest structure for fragment collection.
