## Story Integration

### Lightsworn Historical Mastery
**Chapter 21 Documentation**: The **Lightsworn manual** reveals **Stasis** was known as **"the Basilisk's Gaze"** among **Red magic masters**, described as **"perhaps the most difficult Red magic to utilize."** The manual provides detailed tactical applications including **"freezing oneself"** and **"stutter-stepping"** combat techniques where warriors would **"freeze their opponent and immediately end the engagement with a decisive blow."**

**Master Jirro's Technique**: Historical accounts describe **Master Jirro** using **Stasis** for **"closing distance and keeping pace through a succession of exchanges"** before **freezing opponents** for **decisive strikes**. The manual notes such techniques made **close-quarters combat** with **skilled Red Magi** extremely dangerous.

**Twelve-Second Contact Requirement**: Chapter 21 confirms the **"requisite twelve seconds of concentration and uninterrupted magical contact"** described in QM data, emphasizing the **tactical vulnerability** this creates during **combat applications**.

### Modern Research Limitations
**Chapter 26 Research Failure**: **Queen Zelda's** magical research teams report **"absolutely zero progress has been made with respect to Stasis"** despite having **"most learned red mages"** and **"relative excess of magic and willingness to spend it."** Research leader **Vestele** confirms this has been **"a subject of intense scrutiny for decades, if not centuries"** with no advancement.

**Knowledge Gap**: The complete inability of **modern mages** to replicate **Stasis** despite **detailed historical documentation** suggests the technique requires **specific divine empowerment** or **Lightsworn status** rather than conventional **Red magic training**. This aligns with the **"fabled to be used by the [[Lightsworn]] of yore"** description.

### Tactical & Combat Applications
**Stutter-Stepping Combat**: Historical **Lightsworn** developed **sophisticated tactical applications** using **temporal freezing** for **engagement control**, creating **"exchanges aimed at maintaining opposition"** before **decisive freezing** and **finishing strikes**.

**Self-Application Risks**: The manual warns that **"momentarily freezing oneself"** is **"obscenely dangerous to do in live combat"** and **"should absolutely not attempt this unless the need is dire."** Only **legendary masters** like **"Mistress Shivi the Unbreakable"** could **"perfectly time their magics to break their enemies' weapons."**

**Resistance Mechanics**: Historical sources confirm **MP resistance** capabilities where **"magic must be expended proportional to the mystical fortitude of the opposing magus,"** requiring **"substantial reserves"** for effective use against **powerful targets**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Red Magic Classification**: Perfect alignment with **Chapter 21** classification as **Red magic** and **Chapter 26** confirmation of **Red mage specialization**, establishing **Stasis** as an **advanced Red magic technique** rather than **separate magical system**.

**Divine Magic Heritage**: The **"fabled to be used by the [[Lightsworn]]"** description aligns with **Chapter 21** revelations that **Lightsworn manuals** contain **detailed Stasis documentation**, indicating this was a **standard divine technique** for **empowered champions**.

**Technical Specifications**: QM data **perfectly matches** **Chapter 21** manual descriptions regarding **twelve-second contact requirement**, **concentration needs**, and **maintenance demands**, demonstrating **complete canonical consistency**.

**Lost Knowledge Status**: The **dramatic gap** between **historical mastery** (detailed tactical applications) and **modern failure** (complete inability to replicate) confirms **Stasis** as **genuinely lost divine magic** requiring **supernatural empowerment**.

## Description

**About**:
**Stasis (Individual)** represents one of the **most advanced Red magic techniques** historically mastered by the **[[Lightsworn]]** champions of **[[Hylia]]**. Known among **Red magic practitioners** as **"the Basilisk's Gaze,"** this **temporal manipulation ability** allows the user to **lock a target in temporal stasis** through **sustained magical contact** and **concentrated will**.

**Historical Technique**: **Ancient Lightsworn** developed **sophisticated combat applications** including **"stutter-stepping"** tactics where warriors would **engage opponents** through **successive exchanges** before **applying temporal freeze** for **decisive finishing strikes**. **Master Jirro** exemplified this approach, using **Stasis** to **control engagement timing** and **ensure victory** through **perfectly timed immobilization**.

**Contact Requirements**: The ability demands **twelve seconds** of **uninterrupted physical or magical contact** with the target, creating **significant tactical vulnerability** during **activation**. **Concentration disruption** immediately **breaks the effect**, making **battlefield application** extremely challenging without **proper setup** or **tactical advantage**.

**Resistance Dynamics**: Targets can **expend MP** to **resist temporal locking**, with **resistance costs** **proportional to mystical fortitude**. This creates **magical resource competition** where **powerful mages** can **exhaust the caster** through **sustained resistance**, requiring **substantial reserves** for **reliable application**.

**Maintenance Concentration**: Successfully applied **Stasis** requires **ongoing concentration** and **20 MP per minute maintenance**, preventing **indefinite temporal locking** while enabling **tactical timing control** for **brief decisive periods**.

**Lost Divine Heritage**: Modern **Red mages** cannot replicate the technique despite **detailed historical documentation** and **decades of research effort**, indicating **Stasis** requires **divine empowerment** or **Lightsworn status** rather than **conventional magical training**.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
MP expended by person attempting to escape (initial) + 20 MP/min (maintenance)

**Time Cost**:
Uninterrupted physical or magical contact for twelve seconds

**Description**:
Lock a person in temporal stasis. A locked person can expend MP to prevent the stasis.

Must be maintained or the effect is lost. Maintenance requires some minimal amount of concentration to be spent.
