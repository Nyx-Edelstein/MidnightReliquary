## Description
### Courage

1) Held by [[Link]]
* Necklace he wears which was given to him by his uncle. The necklace is passed down by the men of his family, said to grant luck and good fortune to its wearer.

2) [[Gulf of Nayru]]
* Lost amidst the rubble in the ruins of a long-forgotten keep overlooking the Gulf of Nayru on the southwestern peninsula of the [[Lomei Badlands]].

3) [[Lost Woods]] North
* Captured by the Great [[Fae]]rie [[Genazede]] when its previous owner stumbled into her domain. Genazede cannot use it herself, but she knows exactly what it is, and is waiting for an opportunity to come along to get use out of it.

4) [[Faron Woods]] West
* Attached to a bracelet that inadvertently found its way onto the wrist of a wolf ("[[Courage Wolf]]") that was scrounging around the ruins of a great temple here. While not the biggest or strongest of the wolves, due to the influence of the shard, they have established a massive pack that roams the Faron Woods, often finding meals in unsuspecting travelers that wander to close...

5) The [[Forgotten Temple]]
* Hundreds of years ago, an Ancient Hero ([[The Ancient Hero]]) of Hyrule who possessed the [[Triforce of Courage]] fought with the [[Blin]] at [[the Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess]]. Though vastly outnumbered, he successfully lead a defense to halt the attack. While he avoided all singularly lethal blows, he died shortly afterwards due to his wounds. Recognizing that they could not hold the location against future Blin invasions, [[Hylian]]s fell back to [[Talus]]. When the Triforce of Courage shattered at the death of its wielder, a single shard remained at the abandoned temple, coming to rest at the grave of the hero who died there. Ivy has now grown up around the temple, protecting the resting ground of the hero. The temple has faded from memory over the ages.

6) [[Arbiter's Grounds]]
* Watched over by the ghost of the original leader of the [[Gerudo]], [[Ibboso the Bold]] (or Ibboso the Damned, depending on who tells the tale). Ibboso received several shards of the [[Triforce of Courage]] when [[the Ancient Hero]] died, the shards being drawn to him for having dared to rebel against [[Morudo Geira]] after their defeat at the hands of the Hylians. Despite this, he was captured and executed for his hubris, along with his entire clan. Their vengeful spirits now reside on these hallowed grounds, and protect a single remaining shard of courage.

7) [[Eldin]] (Dragon)
* Hundreds of years ago when the Ancient Hero died, a [[Rito]] in Eldin’s domain received a shard of Courage. Over time, it came to adorn a staff that was held by the Rito tribe’s Elder Chief, and was used ceremoniously in coming-of-age rituals by their people. Now lays forgotten on a random patch of land somewhere within The [[Eye of Din]].
* Eldin also remembers when the Triforce was last split, and was flying above his roost at the time. As such, he knows the general locations of each of the shards. If he can be awakened (and convinced to not destroy those come to call), he may be an essential source of information.

8) [[Faron]] (Sea Serpent)
* Like Eldin, Faron was originally a [[guardian beast]], meant to protect the land when [[Hylia]] could not do so directly. She guarded a [[perpendicularity]] near the location that is now known as [[Ja'bu Cove]]. However, Faron was overwhelmed and corrupted by an entity of the void ([[Ja'bu]]), tortured and driven mad. In constant pain, Faron exists in a near-feral state now, and feeds on [[Blin]] fishers off the northeastern coast. A shard of Courage lies in wreckage at the bottom of the sea here -- its previous wielder a hapless adventurer who found himself at Faron’s displeasure.

9) [[Lanayru]] (Kraken)
* The guardian beast Lanayru is the progenitor and patroness of the [[Octorok]]s. She keeps watch over this shard, which found its way into her domain a few decades after [[the Ancient Hero]] died -- likely from an adventurer seeking out rumors of other shards located nearby.

### Wisdom

1-3) Held by [[Zelda]]
* Passed down by the royal family, on the matrilineal line. Zelda wears the royal necklace and bracelets. Each have a symbol of the Triforce, with a shard of Wisdom in the place of each piece of Wisdom. Zelda was trained by her mother in the usage of their abilities, and also knows some lore regarding the shards of Power and Courage.

4-5) Ruins of [[Byrna]]
* When [[Blin]] invaded and [[Hylia]] failed to protect the people approximately 1000 years ago, [[Farwatch]] fell quickly to their onslaught. Byrna was home to [[the Order of Sages]], known for their great wisdom and spiritual guidance -- and who also possessed two shards of Wisdom. While much of the populace fled at the direction of the Council of Elders, the Sages prepared. Seeing no visions in which Byrna had a future fighting the Blin head-on, they instead took defensive action. Catacombs and sewers were connected, fortified, and hidden. Food was stockpiled. Plants and lichen which could grow underground with minimal light were harvested. The strongest and brightest were trained in guerrilla warfare. When the Blin finally reached Byrna, they met a city largely evacuated. After overrunning the minimal resistance they found, the Blin Warlord settled in to make the city his home. However, every night, hundreds to thousands of Blin would go missing, apparently slain by ghosts, until even the Blin Warlord and his trusted Lieutenants were killed. Eventually, not knowing where these strikes came from and unable to retaliate, the Blin gave up on Byrna as cursed. The people of Byrna used their shards of Wisdom to plan strikes, interpreting visions for success. Now, the ruined city has a lively underground, raiding any Blin or [[Lizalfos]] who venture too close to the city, scavenging above ground, keeping populations low, fishing, and eating roots and moss. Byrna has survived, and the Ruins, while apparently uninhabited, always seem to harbor danger when a visitor least expects it.

6) Ruins of [[Farwatch]]
* Happening upon an ancient relic, a more-intelligent-than-average Blin (who came to call himself "[[Ildram the Sage]]") understood vaguely what treasure they had found. Influenced by the power of the shard of Wisdom, he gathered together those Blin that would listen to his teachings, and raised a monastery that has withstood the ages. Here, especially intelligent or forward-thinking Blin come to seek peace and enlightenment.

7) Held by [[Zora]]
* Found within the gemstone of a relic passed between generations of Zora, now held by [[Nineve the Wise]]. The Zora use this when interacting with other races, interpreting any bad sign seen in visions as reason to decline deals or exile travelers. Recent signs have been bad. As a result, the Zora are more isolated than ever.

8) Held by [[Deku]]
* A massive Deku bonded with a Fae, and later happened upon this shard. With its power, this “[[Great Deku Tree]]” has managed to enthrall and enslave countless creatures, and expand its influence over a significant fraction of the [[Lost Woods]]. Notably, [[Hylian]] children who wander too far into the forest often find their way into his dominion.

9) Held by [[Eldin]]
* Adorns a scepter once held by the High Priest of Eldin. Now lays forgotten in Eldin’s lair.

### Power

1) Won by [[Ganondorf]]
* This shard was won by Ganondorf when he defeated the avatar of [[Morudo Geira]] (with generous help from [[Demise]]).

2) Held by Ganondorf
* This shard is held within the Sword of Kings, legendary artifact of the [[Gerudo]] people. Ganondorf holds it now, claiming it by right of conquest after his ascension to High King of the Gerudo.

3-5) Held by [[Blin]] Mokoblin (*)
* [[Big Bis]]
    * Originally the boss of Marauder’s Lake, this Mokoblin was the first to be subdued by Ganondorf on his pilgrimage to win the Triforce of Power and create an army. The shard is simply worn on a necklace.
* [[Kurruk the Red]]
    * Originally the Blin leader with the largest tribe on the Plains, this warlord was defeated and forced into submission by Ganondorf with the aid of Big Bis and his tribes. Kurruk the Red commands the bulk of the Blin forces, and wears the shard on a ring.
* [[Boss Snurl]]
    * The northernmost Mokoblin of the Blin refused Ganondorf’s demand to join his growing horde. As a result, he was slain in single combat by Kurruk the Red at the behest of Ganondorf. His second-in-command, Boss Snurl, was granted the spoils of his superior, along with command of his tribes. This Mokoblin spearheaded the assault on Talus outpost and is at the forefront of the invasion into [[Castletown]]. He wears the shard as an earring.

6) Held by [[King Hyrule]]
* In the past thousand years, Hyrule has needed many strong warriors. In situations particularly dire, the reigning monarch rides out to defend the realm his or herself. More commonly though, the current King Hyrule simply uses it in flagrant displays of power intended to impress and win influence.

7) Held by [[Goron]]s
* Passed down from Chieftain to Chieftain, this shard is used to mark who will head the Council of Primes, and represent the Gorons to other peoples. The current Chieftain, [[Rhargon]], recently obtained it, and is currently looking at waging an offensive against the [[Lynel]]s with its power, with the goal of avenging the previous Chieftain who fell to one of their kind and pushing back Lynel encroachment into the mountains.

8-9) Held by a [[Lynel]]
* A mighty Lynel, [[Kiat the Warmonger]], holds a pair of shards in the [[Lomei Badlands]] and commands a massive harem. Arguably the strongest living creature outside of the [[Guardian Beast]]s. Other Lynels come from far and wide to pay him homage and beg his blessing, though seldom is he impressed with their offerings.

## Story Integration

### Central Narrative Role
This comprehensive fragment distribution map serves as the **strategic foundation** for the entire Legacy of the Goddess conflict. The scattered nature of the 27 Triforce fragments creates multiple objectives, power centers, and alliance opportunities that drive both protagonist and antagonist actions throughout the story.

### Fragment Distribution Analysis

**Courage Fragments (9 total)**:
- **Link's Heritage**: Fragment 1 in family necklace represents generational heroic legacy and establishes divine selection
- **Lost Locations**: Gulf of Nayru ruins, Lost Woods Genazede, Forgotten Temple grave site
- **Guardian Beast Holdings**: Faron's corruption-protected underwater fragment, Lanayru kraken territory, Eldin's memory of splitting event
- **Creature Bonds**: Courage Wolf pack leadership, Ibboso's vengeful spirit protection

**Wisdom Fragments (9 total)**:
- **Royal Inheritance**: Fragments 1-3 with Zelda establish matrilineal divine authority 
- **Survivor Communities**: Byrna underground resistance (2 fragments), Order of Sages wisdom tradition
- **Racial Holdings**: Nineve the Wise (Zora diplomatic isolation), Great Deku Tree (Lost Woods dominance)
- **Enlightened Corruption**: Ildram the Sage's Blin monastery demonstrates wisdom transcending species barriers

**Power Fragments (9 total)**:
- **Ganondorf's Network**: Direct holdings (2) plus lieutenant distribution creates organized command structure
- **Institutional Holdings**: King Hyrule (legitimate authority), Goron Chieftain (tribal leadership)
- **Apex Predators**: Kiat the Warmonger's pair represents ultimate non-divine power concentration

### Story Correlation

**Ancient Hero Connection**: The Sacred Temple battle directly connects to previous worldbuilding entries, establishing the historical catastrophe that scattered fragments and created current power vacuum. Link's role as spiritual successor to this Ancient Hero creates thematic continuity.

**Guardian Beast Framework**: Eldin's memory of the Triforce splitting provides crucial intelligence asset - **"he knows the general locations of each of the shards"** - offering potential strategic advantage if alliance can be established. Faron's corruption and Lanayru's isolation create both obstacles and opportunities for fragment recovery.

**Political Implications**: Fragment distribution creates complex diplomatic situations - Zora isolation due to bad omens, Goron-Lynel conflict over territorial control, Byrna's hidden survival affecting regional power balance.

### Canonical Reconciliation

**Story Consistency**: Fragment locations align perfectly with character progression:
- Link's gradual awareness of family legacy and heroic calling
- Zelda's increasing fragment collection through royal inheritance and diplomatic acquisition
- Ganondorf's systematic conquest campaign establishing lieutenant network

**Power Balance**: The 6 Wisdom vs 5 Power distribution referenced in Chapter 29 dialogue matches this framework, with third Courage fragment providing strategic balance opportunity.

**Timeline Coherence**: Ancient Hero's death "hundreds of years ago" establishes appropriate historical distance while maintaining living memory through guardian beasts and institutional preservation.
