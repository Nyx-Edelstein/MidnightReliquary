## Story Integration
**Maritime Threat**: **Primary hazard** for ocean voyages and coastal expeditions, requiring **electrical resistance preparations** or **deep water avoidance tactics**. **Fishing communities** develop **specialized gear** to minimize encounter risks.

**Ecological Balance**: **Apex electrical predators** controlling **fish populations** in coastal waters. Their **electrical discharge capabilities** create **safe zones** around active colonies through **competitor deterrence**.

**Economic Impact**: **Pearl diving** and **underwater salvage operations** require **Bari awareness protocols**. Their presence indicates **healthy marine ecosystems** but complicates **commercial fishing** in affected waters.

## Description
**Classification**:
Hydrozoa
**Size**:
Small - Medium
**Diet**:
Carnivore
**Strategy**:
Ambush Predation
**Environments**:
Oceans

**About**:
Jellyfish-like creatures that stun their prey with a jolt of electricity, and then kill it with sustained lower-voltage current. Feeds on anything they can get their tentacles on.

**Electrical Systems**: **Dual-phase attack patterns** utilizing **high-voltage stunning** followed by **sustained low-voltage killing**. **Bioelectric generation** through **specialized cell clusters** throughout tentacle networks.

**Hunting Behavior**: **Passive drift ambush** tactics, using **ocean currents** for positioning while **electrical sensors** detect **nearby movement**. **Tentacle paralysis** prevents **prey escape** during **feeding processes**.

**Defensive Adaptations**: **Electrical discharge** serves **dual purpose** as both **hunting tool** and **anti-predator defense**. **Transparent body structure** provides **visual camouflage** in open water environments.
