## Story Integration

### Old Magic Ability Classification
**Void Power Application**: Teleportation represents an **Old Magic ability** that utilizes **Void Power** for **dimensional travel** and **reality manipulation**. As indicated by the **"magic-void"** tag, this ability belongs to the category of **pre-creation magical techniques** that operate outside the standard **chromatic magic systems** available to mortal mages.

**Entity-Exclusive Capability**: The teleportation ability would be accessible to **supernatural entities** like **Fi** who possess **Old Magic** capabilities, but not to **chromatic magic users** like **Link**, **Zelda**, or other human mages. This maintains the **Entity vs. Mage** distinction fundamental to the magical hierarchy.

### Mark of Transference Integration
**Marked Individual Summoning**: The ability to **"effectively 'summon' marked individuals to your location"** directly connects with the **[[Mark of Transference]]** system, where entities can create **soul-level connections** with willing targets for enhanced communication and coordination. This synergy enables **strategic extraction** and **emergency response** capabilities.

**Divine Coordination Applications**: For an entity like **Fi**, teleportation combined with **Hylia's Mark** system could enable **instant tactical repositioning** of marked allies, though the **Divine Power costs** would need to be carefully managed for sustainable operations.

### Strategic Limitations & Tactical Applications
**Hostile Environment Restrictions**: The **"cannot be used to or from an area within 100 meters of an actively hostile individual"** limitation prevents teleportation from becoming an **overwhelming tactical advantage** in combat situations, maintaining strategic balance while enabling **emergency extraction** from dangerous but not immediately hostile circumstances.

**Location Memory Requirements**: The constraint that users **"can only travel to a location you have previously visited"** ensures teleportation serves **logistical coordination** rather than **unlimited exploration**, requiring prior reconnaissance and strategic positioning for effective utilization.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Proportional to distance

**Time Cost**:
About six seconds to activate, approximately instant effect

**Description**:
Teleport yourself or an individual in close proximity to another location, along with anything the target is holding or carrying on their person, up to a maximum of 50% of their body weight.

Can be used to effectively "summon" marked individuals to your location.

Cannot travel short distances. Can only be used to travel to a location you have previously visited. May fail if the location has changed significantly since then. Cannot be used to travel to or from an area in close proximity of an actively hostile individual.
