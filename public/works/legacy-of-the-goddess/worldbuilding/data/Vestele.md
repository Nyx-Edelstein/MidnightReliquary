## Story Integration

### Hidden Knowledge Keeper & Cosmic Truth Guardian
**Divine Revelation Authority (Chapter 5)**: Vestele immediately recognizes that **Fi, not Hylia, granted Zelda her powers**, demonstrating extensive knowledge about divine entities and their true nature. Her revelation that **Hylia died ages ago** while the Faith maintains worship for stability shows her role as guardian of dangerous cosmic truths that could destabilize society if revealed prematurely.

**Fae Threat Education**: Vestele provides crucial historical context about **Fae entities**, explaining how **General Arminel was manipulated by Cyrae** and revealing the **true origin of the Seekers** as Fae hunters rather than generic monster slayers. Her knowledge of these suppressed historical events positions her as the kingdom's primary expert on supernatural entity threats.

### Temple of Time Operations & Artifact Management
**Niesis Containment Oversight (Chapter 7)**: Vestele guides Zelda through the **Temple of Time vaults** to encounter the imprisoned **Fae Niesis**, demonstrating her authority over supernatural containment operations. Her explanation of Niesis's **willing submission to imprisonment** and role in **sealing other Fae** shows intimate knowledge of ancient supernatural conflicts and containment protocols.

**Artifact Research Coordination**: Vestele confirms the reality of **legendary magical artifacts** including the **Basilisk's Gaze (Stasis Red magic)** and **Soulsteel (Void magic connection)**, correcting Zelda's understanding that **Triforce fragments are the source of magic itself** rather than mere conduits. Her expertise spans both theoretical magical knowledge and practical artifact identification.

### Ancient Language & Historical Translation
**Old Script Expertise (Chapter 8)**: During temple artifact testing, Vestele **partially translates glowing runes** in Old Script, revealing messages from Hylia about trials involving **wind, earth, fire, water, and life** to prove worthiness.
