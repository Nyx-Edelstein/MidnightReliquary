## Story Integration

### Command Structure & Personnel
**High Captain Roesia** commands Last Bastion with **First Lieutenant Bartholomew** as her second-in-command, managing the complex **Gerudo border interface** and implementing **restrictive territorial policies**. The fortress operates under direct military authority while serving diplomatic and trade regulation functions.

### Border Enforcement & Policy Evolution
**Historical Policy Changes**: **Chapter 4** details the **evolution from peaceful coexistence to military confrontation**, including the construction of **makeshift prison camps** to handle captured Gerudo raiders and the eventual implementation of **"no prisoners" engagement orders** due to escalating raid frequency and coordination failures.

**Territorial Control**: The fortress serves as the **primary enforcement point** for Gerudo movement restrictions, requiring **pre-approved business justification** and **assigned supervision** for any Gerudo entering Hylian territory, reflecting centuries of **tenuous diplomatic relations**.

### Strategic Communications & Operational Role
**Chapter 11** establishes Last Bastion as a **communication hub** capable of **urgent message transmission** during critical operations, demonstrating integration into kingdom-wide intelligence and command networks extending even to desert expedition teams.

**Chapter 19** and **Chapter 27** reference Last Bastion as a **strategic waypoint** for major military operations, including the **secret passage routes** used during Queen Zelda's expeditions and **coalition coordination** during the Sunseeker alliance negotiations.

### Historical Context & Territorial Significance
The fortress represents the **permanent boundary established after the Hylian-Gerudo civil war**, serving as the enforcement point for **territorial cession agreements** that granted **"all lands south of Last Bastion"** to Gerudo sovereignty while maintaining Hylian security interests.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Enhanced Operational Scope**: Story evidence confirms traditional **border protection** and **Gerudo ingress control** roles, but reveals significant expansion into **prison camp management**, **trade regulation enforcement**, and **strategic communication operations** not present in original worldbuilding data.

**Policy Enforcement Evolution**: The facility's role has evolved from **diplomatic interface** to **military confrontation point**, reflecting the breakdown of peaceful relations and the implementation of increasingly restrictive policies culminating in **lethal engagement orders**.

## Description
A faction of the [[Hylian]] military, charged with protecting the shared border with the [[Gerudo]] people and enforcing territorial restrictions on Gerudo movement into the kingdom. The organization has evolved from diplomatic border management to active military confrontation due to escalating raid activities and coordination failures.

Historically, Gerudo seeking entry to Hylian territory required pre-approved business justification and assigned supervision. However, recent policy changes have resulted in "no prisoners" engagement orders and the construction of prisoner camps to handle captured raiders.

"Last Bastion" also refers to the fortress that acts as the primary base of operations for the military there, serving as both a strategic communication hub and the enforcement point for centuries-old territorial agreements established after the Hylian-Gerudo civil war.
