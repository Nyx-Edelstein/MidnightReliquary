## Story Integration

### Void Magic Power Hierarchy
**Ultimate Destructive Capability**: Annihilate Entity represents the **most extreme form of void magic** available, serving as the **permanent solution** for **entity threats** that cannot be contained through conventional **[[Seal Entity]]** methods. The **Entity's current power^1.25** cost structure indicates **exponential difficulty** against **more powerful entities**.

**Strategic Alternative to Sealing**: Unlike **[[Seal Entity]]** which **forces entity power out of the realm**, Annihilate Entity **permanently separates power** while **retaining it within the realm**, potentially allowing **power absorption** or **redistribution** to other entities or magic users.

### Fae & Entity Threat Applications
**Fae Destruction Capability**: This magic could theoretically **permanently destroy** dangerous **[[Fae]]** entities like **[[Cyrae]]**, **[[Niesis]]**, or corrupted entities, though the **extreme power costs** would make such applications **prohibitively expensive** for all but the most dangerous targets.

**Locus Dependency Requirement**: The **"locus or avatar containing the entirety of that entity's power"** requirement means **successful annihilation** requires **complete containment** first, making this magic **dependent on prior sealing success** or **targeting entities** at their **primary manifestation points**.

### Power Mechanics & Limitations
**Twelve Second Casting**: The **extremely short casting time** compared to other void magics indicates **Annihilate Entity** trades **preparation time** for **massive power investment**, requiring **immediate massive mana expenditure** rather than **sustained casting**.

**Partial Annihilation Effects**: When used on **incomplete entity manifestations**, the magic **permanently separates contained power** rather than **destroying the entity entirely**, creating **power fragments** that could potentially be **recovered or redistributed**.

### Canonical Implications & Seeker Applications
**Seeker Ultimate Weapon**: This magic likely represents the **Seekers' ultimate contingency** for **entities too dangerous** for conventional containment, though the **massive power requirements** would limit its use to **exceptional circumstances** with **extensive preparation**.

**Entity Power Redistribution**: The **retention of separated power** within the realm creates opportunities for **strategic power management**, potentially allowing **transfer of entity abilities** to **allied forces** or **magical enhancement projects**.

### Cross-References & Connections
- **[[Seal Entity]]**: Alternative containment approach, complementary strategy
- **[[Void Magic]]**: Ultimate expression of void magical capabilities
- **[[Fae]]**: Primary target category for annihilation magic
- **[[Seekers]]**: Likely users of ultimate entity destruction magic
- **[[Niesis]]**, **[[Cyrae]]**: Potential high-value targets for annihilation
- **Entity Power Management**: Power separation, redistribution possibilities

**Description**:
Permanently annihilate the entity, if used on a locus or avatar containing the entirety of that entity's power. Otherwise, permanently separates the contained power from the entity.

Same constraints as sealing, but instead of forcing the entity's power out of the realm, the power remains.

**Tactical Considerations**: The **exponential power scaling** means **Annihilate Entity** becomes **increasingly impractical** against **major entities**, requiring **specialized preparation**, **multiple casters**, or **power amplification** to successfully execute against **significant threats**.

**Strategic Applications**: Beyond **direct entity destruction**, this magic could serve **power redistribution goals** by **separating entity power** from **hostile entities** for **transfer to allied forces**, creating **strategic advantages** in **supernatural conflicts**.

**Containment Prerequisites**: **Successful annihilation** requires **complete entity containment** within a **single locus or avatar**, making **prior sealing operations** or **entity manifestation control** essential for **effective application** of this ultimate magic.

**Power Retention Implications**: Unlike **[[Seal Entity]]** which **removes power from the realm entirely**, **Annihilate Entity** creates **recoverable power sources** that could be **absorbed by other entities**, **channeled into artifacts**, or **distributed among magic users** for **enhanced capabilities**.
