## Story Integration

### Redirect Entry Status
**Cross-Reference Consolidation**: This entry serves as a redirect to **[[The Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess]]**, ensuring that searches for "Forgotten Temple" connect to the comprehensive documentation of the ancient battlefield where an **Ancient Hero** made his final stand against **Blin** invasion hundreds of years ago.

**Historical Significance Preservation**: The redirect maintains accessibility to the **Ancient Hero's grave site** and **Triforce of Courage fragment location**, preventing loss of critical information about this **ivy-protected** sacred ground that **"has faded from memory over the ages."**

### Canonical Cross-Reference
**Triforce Fragment Context**: References to the "Forgotten Temple" in **[[Triforce Shard Locations (World Building)]]** documentation align with this being the same location as **The Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess**, where a **Courage fragment** rests at the **hero's grave** following the **Triforce of Courage** shattering upon his death.

**Memory Loss Theme**: The "forgotten" designation reflects the broader theme throughout Legacy of the Goddess of **lost historical knowledge** and **faded heroic legacies**, similar to how **ancient Lightsworn techniques** and **Seeker organization history** have been largely forgotten over time.
