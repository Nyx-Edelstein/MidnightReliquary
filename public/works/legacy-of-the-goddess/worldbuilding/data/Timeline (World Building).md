## Description
**Comprehensive Chronological Record of the Hylian Realms**

This timeline chronicles the history of the Hylian Realms from their creation by the Golden Goddesses through the rise of Ganondorf and the beginning of the current narrative. The timeline integrates cosmic events, divine conflicts, and mortal struggles into a unified historical framework.

## Pre-Creation Era

**-15621 years Before Creation:**
[[Odium]] has destroyed or shattered many other Shards of Adonalsium, and his great cosmic war has left countless worlds in ruin. Among the Shards remaining are Wisdom, Power, and Courage. After great deliberation, those possessing these Shards -- [[Nayru]], [[Din]], and [[Farore]] -- decide to unite and resist Odium with their combined power. However, knowledgeable of the destruction of so many others by Odium's hand, and unwilling to risk a direct confrontation, the Goddesses instead decide to try another approach.

Together, they venture into the formless [[Void Between Worlds]], giving up the Cosmere as lost. There, they would attempt to create dozens of worlds amenable to life, sealed away from the influence of Odium, where the inhabitants could thrive and live in peace.

Lead by Din, the trio engages in battle with the entities of the Void, destroying them, sealing them away, or forcing them into submission. Simultaneously, Nayru begins shaping and molding the laws of physics to be more amenable to life, while Din carves out pocket-worlds, and Farore begins work tuning and stabilizing the biospheres of life-capable planets.

The trio become known throughout the realm as "The Golden Goddesses."

## The Creation Era

**Year 0 After Creation:**
The Goddesses complete their work, and create [[Hylia]] to act as its steward and protector in their absence. They instruct her in the use of her powers, and leave behind their Shards in her charge, keeping only a fraction of their energies for themselves.

The power of these Shards is focused and concentrated into a single powerful relic -- the Triforce -- and the Golden Goddesses use it to seal off the Physical, Cognitive, and Spiritual Realms of their creation from the outside. As no Shard can touch the power of another without being consumed, TGG believed this would provide a near perfect defense against Odium, while allowing their successor the power necessary to see to its continuation.

## The First Threat

**2314 AC:**
Odium learns of the Hylian Realms. Intrigued by the machinations of the Golden Goddesses, he begins plotting to usurp control of the Triforce from Hylia, either to make use of it for his own ends, or to destroy it if he cannot use it without influence from the other Shards.

Unable to assault the realms himself due to the ingenuity of the Goddesses, he begins by manipulating multiple entities of the Void towards interfering with Hylia's efforts to sustain and protect the realms under her dominion.

## The Golden Age

**3232 AC:**
Under Hylia's guidance and protection, and despite constant setbacks and interference from malicious entities, her chosen people, the [[Hylian]]s, grow to create a powerful, prosperous, and far-reaching civilization in one of the worlds under her governance. Referred to in myths and legends as "[[The Sovereignty]]," this civilization spans continents, and their usage of magic and technology is truly wondrous to behold.

## The Great Calamity

**4962 AC:**
When the timing is right, and other matters have been dealt with, Odium expends a great deal of power orchestrating a concerted assault against Hylia, convincing a powerful and sinister entity known as [[Majora]] to lead the attack. Wave after wave assaults the Hylian realms -- each defeated in due course -- but the tides do not subside. Amidst centuries of conflict, Hylia is unable to protect her people, and The Sovereignty is toppled and left in ruin.

When Odium's victory seemed all but certain, a powerful demigod named Shūen, claiming to be a child of Din, comes to Hylia's aid and assists her in fending off the assault for good, thus foiling Odium's plans.

**5145 AC:**
When the last of the attacking entities are defeated, Shūen leaves Hylia, claiming he must continue his quest to seek out and destroy the the "Forces of Darkness." When pressed for details, he does not give any.

Hylia begins to rebuild after this "[[Great Calamity]]." As their homeworld was rendered inhospitable and barren, Hylia sends those remaining of her peoples to distant worlds, establishing the [[Lightsworn]] to guide and protect them in times of need. The Dominion of [[Byrna]] is founded soon thereafter.

## The Birth of Demise

**5442 AC:**
With other matters to contend with, having limited other options, and uncontent to allow the power of the Shards of the Goddesses to continue existing in a form that could one day threaten his dominion over the Cosmere, Odium hastens his plans. Taking a highly calculated risk with his limited reserves of power, he draws Shūen into an ambush, and narrowly manages to defeat him. He captures and tortures Shūen, shatters his mind, and imparts a tiny fraction of his own being into the demigod's broken body.

[[Demise]] is born; the merger of Slivers of Power and of Odium. He is tasked with conquering and undoing the works of the Golden Goddesses, freeing up Odium himself to contend with other matters.

## The Founding of Hyrule

**5888 AC:**
Amid political turmoil, an influential faction lead by Nialay Lensa, a prominent Lightsworn and direct descendant of Hylia, secedes and establishes the Queendom of [[Farwatch]]. Nialay crowns herself Queen [[Nialay Proventia Zelda Hyrule I]].

## The Betrayal

**7312 AC:**
After much planning and preparation, Demise engineers a great battle against the Hylian Realms. With minimal effort, he gains Hylia's trust by coming to her aid when it appeared the tides would turn against her, just as Shūen did almost two-thousand years prior.

Together they repel the attack. Hylia, enthralled with Shūen, begs him to stay. Demise, under the guise of Shūen, insists he is needed elsewhere, but "allows" himself to be convinced to stay for a time. He uses this time to charm and build rapport with Hylia as a distraction. Meanwhile, he fuels numerous plots throughout the worlds intended to sow discord and chaos, gathers his strength, and amasses forces for a coming invasion.

## Hylia's Demise

**7475 AC:**
Demise's plot culminates in a grand invasion. With hordes of demonic entities at his back, he attacks in a direct assault against Hylia herself from within the realm. Hylia, caught completely off-guard, expends nearly all of her power in an attempt to rebuff the attack, as she simultaneously struggles to keep check on the besieged worlds.

It is soon apparent to her that she has been outmaneuvered, and cannot hope to win. In a last desperate attempt to prevent the entirety of the realms from falling to his control, she attempts to permanently seal the world of the battlefield away from the inside.

She is successful, though at great cost. In her weakened state, Demise shatters her being into thousands of Splinters, most of which escape into the Void before the world is sealed away completely, and eventually make their way to other worlds. Demise turns his attention to escaping his imprisonment.

## The Forsaken Era

**7681 AC | Year 0 of the Forsaken Era:**
The [[Blin]] invasion overwhelms [[Farwatch]]. Millions of Hylians are killed and the city is razed. With Hylia nowhere to be found, and the powers of her [[Lightsworn]] long since faded, the survivors of [[Farwatch]] and the people of [[Byrna]] abandon their lands and take refuge beyond the mountains, in the riverlands to the west. The Hylians collectively begin a long and costly war against the Blin, attempting to repel the invaders and retake the eastern plains.

**8041 AC | 360 FE:**
After a massive setback with a Blin Warlord's offensive pushing the Hylians out of what lands they had managed to reclaim, the Hylians finally decide to give up the eastern lands for lost. They set up a permanent defensive outpost at [[Talus]] to hold the disorganized Blin hordes at bay.

**8067 AC | 386 FE:**
Believing Hylia to have forsaken them, the [[Gerudo]] faction is formed, worshiping the ancient and powerful entity, [[Morudo Geira]]. Geira promises them power, in exchange for blood sacrifice.

## The Gerudo Civil War

**8095 AC | 414 FE:**
Amidst growing tensions and rumors of blasphemous practices, King [[Domhall Gavrillius Hyrule II]], at the behest of the [[Shiekah]], gathers an army to expel the Gerudo from Hyrule. The Gerudo, guided by Morudo Geira, are prepared for this, and enact a coup against the Royal family. They succeed in taking the King's life, as well as that of his wife and two daughters.

**8095 - 8107 AC | 414 - 426 FE:**
Twelve years of bloody civil war rages, as the Gerudo attempt to seize control and quell dissent. The king's nephew and only surviving heir, [[Basilius Rhomar Hyrule]], takes up the crown and command of the armies to avenge his uncle and oust the usurpers.

The Gerudo come close to triumph, but a champion arises, apparently bearing Hylia's blessing. The champion rallies the scattered Hylians, and the Gerudo are forced to retreat to the southern mesas. 

The source of the Hylian's provenance was of course not Hylia, but a Splintered fragment of her being -- a [[Fae]] named [[Lucia]]. Lucia, passing herself for Hylia to a people eager to believe their Goddess had returned to them, eventually forces Geira into submission.

Despite her victory, Geira proved too powerful for Lucia to fully defeat, and so she was forced to make a pact to limit Geira's damage and her influence over the Hylians. Left with no other choice, Lucia decides to sacrifice herself to Geira in exchange for a binding promise to not directly interfere with in this world forevermore. Geira agrees, and the pact is made.

Independent of Geira's influence and Lucia's pact, ongoing conflicts and border skirmishes between the Hylian and Gerudo people continue, taxing both of the nations.

## The End of the Old Empire

**8289 AC | 508 FE:**
[[The Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess]] falls, and with it the last vestige of Hylian influence east of Talus. Historical works often mark this as the symbolic and final end of the old Hylian Empire.

**8224 - 8282 AC | 543 - 601 FE:**
Amid desires to return Hyrule to glory, a renewed attempt is made to retake the eastern lands, and to cull and subdue the [[Blin]] once and for all. The effort is lead by General [[Rolfus Arminel]], a close relative of the royal family.

This effort ultimately proved to be unsuccessful. After 58 years of fighting, every gain was offset by equal or greater losses, and it was clear no progress against the far more numerous Blin could be made. General Arminel, stubbornly refusing to give up on his dreams of glory, was assassinated by an unknown assailant in his sleep. The Hylians returned home shortly thereafter.

## The Common Era

**8311 AC | 630 FE | Year 0 of the Common Era:**
The Hylian Civil War officially ends. The Gerudo people sue for peace with the Hylians, agreeing to make payments of reparation in return for acknowledgement of sovereignty and formal cession of all lands south of [[Last Bastion]]. This event marks the beginning of the Common Era

**8596 AC | 285 CE:**
A Blin Warlord arises, leading a massive horde to overrun [[Talus]] and [[Hateno]]. The Hylians sustain great losses, but are eventually able to repel and rout the invaders.

## The Rise of Ganondorf

**8815 - 8858 AC | 504 - 547 CE:**
##### **5626 Years after [[The Sovereignty]]**
##### **3896 Years after The [[Great Calamity]]**
##### **3410 Years after the Founding of [[Byrna]]**
##### **2970 Years after the Founding of [[Farwatch]]**
##### **1383 Years after [[Hylia's Demise]]**
##### **1177 Years after the [[Invasion of Farwatch]]**

The Kingdom of Hyrule, although relatively prosperous, is a mere shadow of its former glory, with most of its ancient lore, technology, and magical knowledge being lost to the ravages of war and time.

A [[Gerudo]] youth named [[Ganondorf]] heeds the call of [[Demise]], who promises him great power and glory. Through Demise, he learns of the truth of the oppression of his people by [[Morudo Geira]]. Enraged, he confronts and battles the entity with the assistance of a great infusion of power from Demise, defeating her avatar, slaughtering her cultists, and winning a shard of the [[Triforce of Power]].

This is more than sufficient to return from his Trial of Strength and even enough be hailed as a fabled King Among Kings. However, in the following years, the Gerudo people are beset by numerous plagues, famine, and strife. Most tribes descend into anarchy and barbarism, and Ganondorf's own tribes fair little better.

Desperate for help, Ganondorf seeks out Demise of his own volition, who shows him the history of his people -- how they were overrun by the [[Blin]], how they were treated by the Hylians for seeking out protection when it was apparent their Goddess would not help them, and how Geira manipulated and then betrayed them to serve only herself.

Ganondorf is appalled that [[Hylia]], who ever had the audacity to call herself their protector, could allow such things to happen. He resolves to take the Triforce for himself, to right the wrongs done to his people, and to remake the world as a better place for all. He begins by seeking out remaining shards of Power, three of which Demise helpfully informs him are held by the Blin, and one by King Hyrule.

Ganondorf succeeds in subduing the Blin leaders and recruiting their hordes for his own purposes. He then turns his attention towards Hyrule itself...
