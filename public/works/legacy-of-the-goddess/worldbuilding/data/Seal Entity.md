## Story Integration

### Strategic Entity Defense Applications
**Seeker Ultimate Containment**: **Seal Entity** represents the **primary strategic defense** against **supernatural entities** that cannot be **permanently destroyed** through conventional means. While **[[Annihilate Entity]]** provides **permanent destruction**, **Seal Entity** offers **reversible containment** for **entities requiring preservation** for **intelligence gathering** or **strategic leverage**.

**Dimensional Defense Protocol**: The **"entirely removing their presence and influence from a world"** effect provides **absolute protection** against **entity interference** in **Material Plane** operations, creating **secure zones** free from **supernatural manipulation** during **critical operations**.

**Entity Power Management**: **"Having one sealed effectively reduces the maximum loci available"** creates **permanent strategic disadvantage** for **targeted entities**, limiting their **operational capacity** even if **primary essence** remains **uncontained**. This enables **gradual weakening** of **major threats** through **systematic locus reduction**.

### Containment Mechanism Analysis
**Immobilization Requirement**: The **"unable to move or resist"** specification indicates **successful sealing** requires **prior subdual** through **combat victory**, **magical restraint**, or **negotiated surrender**. This creates **multi-stage confrontation** requiring **diverse tactical approaches**.

**Partial Power Sealing**: **"If used on an object containing only a piece of an entity's power"** enables **targeted containment** of **entity artifacts**, **possessed objects**, or **partial manifestations** without **engaging the full entity**. This provides **strategic flexibility** for **managing entity influence** through **artifact control**.

**Pocket Dimension Mechanics**: **Complete removal** from **reality** prevents **entity communication**, **power projection**, or **influence manifestation**, creating **absolute isolation** unlike **physical imprisonment** which might be **circumvented** through **supernatural abilities**.

### Locus of Power Implications
**Three Loci Maximum**: The **"entity may normally only have three loci of power in a given realm"** establishes **fundamental limitation** on **entity operational capacity**, making **locus targeting** a **viable strategic approach** for **weakening major threats** without **direct confrontation**.

**Strategic Locus Targeting**: **Systematic sealing** of **entity loci** creates **escalating operational constraints**, forcing **entities** to **concentrate remaining power** in **fewer manifestations** while **reducing overall influence** and **tactical flexibility**.

**Permanent Reduction Effect**: **Sealed loci** remain **permanently unavailable** until **seal breaking**, creating **lasting strategic advantage** and **enabling incremental victory** against **entities** too **powerful** for **direct annihilation**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Void Magic Classification**: As **old-magic-ability**, **Seal Entity** represents **pre-creation dimensional manipulation** accessible to **entities** and **advanced void magic practitioners** but not **standard chromatic mages**. This maintains **Entity vs. Mage** capability distinction.

**Opposed Cost Scaling**: **"Opposed cost"** structure ensures **more powerful entities** require **proportionally greater investment** to **seal**, preventing **trivial containment** of **major threats** while enabling **tactical application** against **lesser entities**.

**Twelve Second Casting**: The **brief casting time** enables **battlefield deployment** during **tactical opportunities** but requires **sustained concentration** and **enemy immobilization**, creating **strategic tension** between **opportunity** and **vulnerability**.

**Authority Hierarchy**: **Seal Entity** represents **alternative approach** to **[[Annihilate Entity]]**, trading **permanent destruction** for **reversible containment** with **lower power requirements** but **ongoing security concerns** regarding **seal integrity**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Opposed cost

**Time Cost**:
Twelve seconds

**Description**:
Seal an entity away into a pocket dimension, entirely removing their presence and influence from a world. The entity (their bound essence or an avatar) must be unable to move or resist. If used on an object containing only a piece of an entity's power, only that part of their power is sealed.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
Opposed cost

**Time Cost**:

**Description**:
Seal an entity away into a pocket dimension, entirely removing their presence and influence from a world. The entity (their bound essence or an avatar) must be unable to move or resist. If used on an object containing only a piece of an entity's power, only that part of their power is sealed.
**QM Notes**:
An entity may normally only have three loci of power in a given realm. Having one sealed effectively reduces the maximum loci available to that entity.
