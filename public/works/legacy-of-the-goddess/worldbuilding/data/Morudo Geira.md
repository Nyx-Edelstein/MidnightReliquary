## Description
### Aliases
* Geira
* The Dark Goddess

## Story Integration
**Canonical Context**: Morudo Geira represents the direct precursor threat to Ganondorf's rise, serving as the ancient entity whose defeat established Ganondorf's credentials as "King Among Kings" while demonstrating Demise's capability to empower mortal champions against powerful void entities.

**Chapter 13 Reference**: Mentioned in story as the entity whose avatar Ganondorf slew at the Obsidian Spire, an action that won him his first Triforce of Power shard and established his legitimacy as Gerudo leader before his eventual corruption.

**Historical Significance**: Geira's manipulation of the Gerudo through blood sacrifice created the cultural vulnerabilities that Demise later exploited to recruit Ganondorf, establishing a pattern of void entity corruption followed by cosmic-level manipulation.

## Canonical Reconciliation
**Defeat Timeline**: Geira's defeat by Ganondorf (with Demise's assistance) represents an early demonstration of Demise's strategyâ€”empowering mortal champions to eliminate rival void entities while positioning those champions for future corruption and control.

**Gerudo Cultural Impact**: Her thousand-year influence over Gerudo culture through the Geiran cult explains the internal divisions and sacrificial practices that weakened Gerudo society, making them susceptible to both Ganondorf's rise and subsequent manipulation by Demise.

## QM Data
### About
An ancient and powerful entity, defeated and sealed away by [[Din]] in eons past. After [[Hylia]]'s demise, she was able to gain a foothold in Hyrule and used her influence to corrupt and control a faction of the [[Hylian]] people, who came to be known as the [[Gerudo]].

After her defeat at the hands of [[Lucia]], she was forced to scale back her machinations in Hyrule. Instead, she used her most devout followers (The [[Geiran]]) to manipulate the Gerudo culture so that they would continuously and willingly offer her sacrifices of their male children. Through this, she has been feeding off of their life energies for over a thousand years, empowering her worshipers and making plans for other worlds.

Also see [[Timeline (World Building)]] and [[Gerudo]] pages for more information.

Primary concerns would be recapturing the Gerudo people if possible. Unlikely to interact much outside of Gerudo areas.
