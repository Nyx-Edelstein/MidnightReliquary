## Story Integration

### Universal Combat Applications
**Prismatic Magic Accessibility**: Energy Burst serves as one of the **fundamental magical techniques** accessible to **all chromatic affinities**, alongside **[[Imbue Object]]**. **Chapter 10** confirms **Link's awareness** of **Energy Burst** as **tactical option** though he **prefers arrows** for **Green Magic applications** due to **superior effectiveness** with his **limited affinity**.

**Affinity-Based Elemental Restrictions**: **Blue Magic** practitioners create **"water/ice-based"** forms, **Red Magic** users generate **"fire-based"** energy, and **Green Magic** casters produce **"electric, air, or nature-based"** manifestations. This **elemental specialization** creates **tactical diversity** while **maintaining chromatic identity**.

**Combat Integration Examples**: **Chapter 27** demonstrates **Gazra's Red Magic** energy applications **"sparking from head to toe"** before **blur-speed attacks**, while **Chapter 34** shows **ice spear** formations and **fire-based** energy concentrations during **team combat operations**.

### Technical Mechanics & Limitations
**Form Concentration Requirements**: **"The user concentrates on a form"** followed by **"charges and releases"** creates **two-phase casting** where **mental visualization** precedes **energy projection**. **Practiced users** achieve **"more fine control"** while **even experienced mages** remain limited to **"relatively crude shapes"**.

**Energy Conservation Framework**: **"Total change to the environment... is limited by MP spent"** establishes **thermodynamic constraints** where **100 Joules per MP** creates **measurable physical effects** without **violating energy conservation**. **Heat generation** and **kinetic energy** both **consume magical power** proportionally.

**Temporary Duration Principle**: **"The forms created in this manner are temporary"** prevents **permanent object creation** unlike **[[Create Object]]** or **[[Imbue Object]]** applications, limiting **Energy Burst** to **immediate tactical use** rather than **strategic construction**.

### Combat Applications & Tactical Integration
**Imbue Object Interaction**: **[[Imbue Object]]** can **"deflect or negate attacks from Energy Burst"** when **"imbued with comparable magic to the attack,"** creating **defensive countermeasures** and **shield vs. sword** tactical dynamics between **enhancement** and **projection** specialists.

**Transfabrulator Defensive Capabilities**: **Chapter 32** demonstrates **[[Link]]'s transfabrulator** creating **"nearly indestructible"** blocks that **"withstood energy blasts from those weird worm-monster things,"** showing **ancient technology** provides **superior Energy Burst defense** compared to **standard imbuing**.

**Scaling Combat Effectiveness**: **Chapter 10** indicates **Energy Burst** effectiveness **scales with affinity strength** where **"adept Green mages"** achieve **"pretty awesome"** results while **weak-affinity users** find **conventional weapons** more **practically effective**.

### Affinity-Specific Manifestations
**Blue Magic Water/Ice Forms**: **Chapter 34** shows **ice spear** formations and **solid ice blocks** for **area control** and **target immobilization**, demonstrating **Blue Magic** Energy Burst applications in **team coordination** and **defensive tactics**.

**Red Magic Fire/Heat Applications**: **Chapter A1** describes **"gathering energy crackled in her palms"** during **[[Impa]]'s enhanced combat**, while **Chapter 33** references **"massive burst that lit up the sky"** for **large-scale destruction**. **Red Magic** Energy Burst provides **offensive power** and **area denial**.

**Green Magic Electric/Nature Manifestations**: **Chapter 27** mentions **"bolts of green energy"** during combat sequences, while **Link's preference** for **arrows over Bursting** suggests **Green Magic** Energy Burst requires **higher skill thresholds** for **practical effectiveness**.

### Training & Mastery Requirements
**Practice-Dependent Precision**: **"Practiced users have more fine control over the form"** indicates **Energy Burst** **mastery progression** where **experience** directly **improves precision** and **tactical utility**. **Novice applications** remain **crude** while **expert use** enables **sophisticated tactical applications**.

**Affinity Strength Correlation**: **"More adept... mages"** achieve **superior results** suggesting **natural affinity strength** **determines ceiling** for **Energy Burst effectiveness**. **High-affinity practitioners** access **advanced applications** while **weak-affinity users** struggle with **basic forms**.

**Strategic vs. Tactical Applications**: **Energy Burst** serves **immediate combat needs** rather than **long-term strategic goals**, contrasting with **[[Create Object]]** for **permanent solutions** and **[[Imbue Object]]** for **equipment enhancement**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Prismatic Magic Framework**: **Energy Burst** belongs to **universal magical techniques** available across **all chromatic affinities** while **maintaining elemental restrictions** that **preserve chromatic identity** and **tactical specialization**.

**Thermodynamic Consistency**: **100 Joules per MP** creates **measurable physical constraints** that **prevent unlimited energy generation** while **enabling significant tactical effects** through **concentrated magical investment**.

**Temporary vs. Permanent Creation**: **Energy Burst** **temporary forms** maintain **distinction** from **[[Create Object]]** **permanent manifestations** and **[[Imbue Object]]** **enhancement applications**, preventing **ability overlap** while **preserving tactical niches**.

**Skill-Based Effectiveness**: **Practice-dependent precision** ensures **Energy Burst** **rewards mastery** and **training investment** while **remaining accessible** to **all magical practitioners** regardless of **specific affinity limitations**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary

**Time Cost**:
3 seconds per 100 MP spent

**Description**:
Concentrate on a desired form, then charge and release a burst of energy that fills that shape. This represents one of the fundamental magical techniques accessible to all chromatic affinities, providing direct energy projection capabilities limited by affinity-based elemental restrictions.

**Affinity-Based Elemental Forms**: **Blue Magic** creates **water/ice-based** manifestations, **Red Magic** generates **fire-based** energy, **Green Magic** produces **electric, air, or nature-based** effects. **Prismatic Magic** users face **no elemental restrictions**, enabling **unlimited form variety**.

**Energy Conservation Framework**: Total environmental change including **heat generation** and **kinetic energy transfer** limited to **100 Joules per MP invested**. This creates **measurable physical effects** while **maintaining thermodynamic consistency**.

**Form Precision Scaling**: **Practiced users** achieve **fine control** over **energy shapes** while **even experienced mages** remain limited to **relatively crude geometric forms**. **Mastery progression** directly **improves tactical utility** and **combat effectiveness**.

**Temporary Duration**: **All Energy Burst forms** dissipate after **immediate effect**, preventing **permanent object creation** and **limiting application** to **tactical situations** rather than **strategic construction**.

**Defensive Interactions**: **[[Imbue Object]]** applications can **deflect or negate** Energy Burst attacks when **imbued with comparable magical power**, creating **shield vs. sword** tactical dynamics between **enhancement** and **projection** specialists.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary

**Time Cost**:
3s / 100 MP spent

**Description**:
The user concentrates on a form, and then charges and releases a burst of energy which fills that form. The energy can be in whatever form the user imagines, but with restrictions based on the affinities of the user (blue=water/ice-based, red=fire-based, green=electric, air, or nature-based, prismatic=no restriction).

The total energy change to the environment (including heat change or kinetic energy imparted) is limited to 100J change in physical energy per MP spent. The forms created in this manner are temporary; the ability is not known to create permanent objects.

**QM Notes**:
Can be used with any type of magic, but for instance, a person with Blue affinity can only use water/ice-based forms.
