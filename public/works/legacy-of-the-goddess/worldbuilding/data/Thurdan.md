## Story Integration

### Eastern Frontier Command Authority
**Talus Guard Leadership**: Commands the primary military branch responsible for containing Blin threats from the Plains of Ruin, overseeing the "primary contingent of Hylian armed forces" at the kingdom's most critical eastern defensive installation.

**Strategic Defensive Operations**: Manages chokepoint defense strategy at Talus Pass where forces "patrol in force, systematically crushing any Blin raiding parties who venture too far inland," transforming geographic advantages into military effectiveness against numerically superior enemies.

### Military Hierarchy Integration
**Command Structure Role**: Operates under Lord General Wymar's overall authority while coordinating with other High Captains (Raolin-City Guard, Melise-Hylia's Watch, Roesia-Last Bastion) as part of kingdom-wide military coordination. Discharged by Zelda after revelations from Link about ignoring Link's warnings.

**Personnel Development**: Oversees tactical training and combat experience development for personnel like Link, who gained "squad leadership experience" at Talus that proves essential for Royal Guard advancement and broader kingdom defense roles.

### Operational Challenges & Leadership Transition
**Link's Early Warnings**: Referenced criticism for "ignoring Link's early warnings about coordinated Blin tactics and attempting to discharge him," suggesting potential limitations in threat assessment regarding emerging supernatural challenges.

**Command Succession**: Averil's promotion from First Lieutenant to High Captain following casualties demonstrates realistic military advancement under wartime conditions.
