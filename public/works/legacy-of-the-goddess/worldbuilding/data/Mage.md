## Story Integration

### Chromatic Magic Practitioner Classification
**Core Magical System Role**: "Mage" serves as the **primary classification term** for practitioners of the **three chromatic magical affinities** (Blue, Red, Green Magic) throughout Legacy of the Goddess. This distinguishes chromatic magic users from **entities** who wield **Old Magic**, creating a fundamental categorical division in magical taxonomy.

**Story Character Applications**: The term applies to characters like **Link** (tri-affinity combat mage), **Impa** (Blue Magic specialist), **Grenja** (Red Magic instructor), and **Jedal** (Green Magic combat medic), establishing their roles within the magical hierarchy while differentiating them from **Fi** (Old Magic entity).

### Entity vs. Mage Distinction
**Ontological Classification System**: The distinction between "Mages" (chromatic magic users) and "Entities" (Old Magic users) represents a **fundamental cosmological division**. Mages access **Divine Energy** from the **Spiritual Realm** through **Golden Goddess** attunement, while Entities manipulate **Void Power** from **pre-creation reality**.

**Canonical Authority Framework**: This classification system explains why **Fi** operates under different magical rules than mortal magic users - she belongs to the **Entity** category with access to **reality manipulation abilities** beyond the scope of chromatic magic limitations.

### Magical Affinity Context
**Training and Development Systems**: Throughout the story, magical education and institutional support (military training, Lightsworn facilities, Order of Sages) focuses specifically on **chromatic magic development** for human mages, while **Old Magic** remains exclusive to supernatural entities and those with divine connections.

**Royal Bloodline Exception**: The **royal family's tri-affinity capability** represents the pinnacle of **Mage** classification, with enhanced access to all three chromatic systems while still operating within the fundamental **Mage vs. Entity** distinction.
