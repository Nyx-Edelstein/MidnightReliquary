## Story Integration

### Central Character Development & Consciousness Expansion
**Zelda's Unconscious Foretelling (Chapter 35)**: Princess Zelda discovers she has been unconsciously using Foretelling throughout her life, particularly during **nightshade tea sessions** where altered consciousness enables intuitive future-seeking. Her realization that **"some part of her mind was always Foretelling"** represents a crucial character development moment, showing how she has **"carved out a part of her mind for just that purposeâ€”a part that thought in the same way she had as a child."**

**Childhood Magical Exploration**: Zelda's memories reveal she used Foretelling as a child for **"clever tricks and shortcuts,"** building understanding **"haphazardly on whatever structure she could find"** rather than developing systematic magical knowledge. This creates **"flimsy understanding propped up by the thinnest twigs and branches"** versus the **"solid trunk of Wisdom"** that [[Sage Amaurath]] encouraged her to cultivate.

### Triforce of Wisdom Enhancement & Fragment Abilities
**Prophecy Fragment Progression**: The **[[Triforce of Wisdom]]** fragments provide systematic enhancement of prophetic abilities:
- **2 shards**: **"prophetic dreams often highly symbolic or metaphorical, and are open to interpretation"**
- **5 shards**: **"Prophetic dreams are more clearly defined"**
- **Enhanced Interpretation**: Fragment empowerment provides clearer visions than standard Blue Magic Foretelling

**Dream Documentation Process**: Zelda maintains a **prophetic dream diary** (Chapter 12) with [[Laylith]]'s assistance to distinguish between **"personal, embarrassing, or random nonsense"** dreams versus genuinely prophetic visions, since **"their relevance is usually only understood in hindsight."**

### Practical Applications & Training
**Link's Combat Integration**: Link learns Foretelling applications during Chapter 21 training, achieving success with **"coin flips mid-air"** but struggling with **"pre-event prediction."** The ancient Lightsworn texts emphasize that **"common sense is oft mistaken for magic, and magic can never substitute for a moment's consideration backed by a lifetime of trained instincts."**

**Scrying Enhancement Technique**: Zelda develops innovative **Foretelling-Scrying combinations** (Chapter 30), using prophecy to **"discern whether or not Scrying into any given area would be successful before actually taking the time to Scry, thereby saving considerable time and effort."** This demonstrates advanced magical synthesis beyond traditional applications.

### Technical Limitations & Reliability Issues
**Interpretive Challenges**: Foretelling visions are **"generally not reliable and are open to interpretation,"** requiring careful analysis to distinguish genuine prophecy from wishful thinking or random mental imagery. The technique's **arbitrary cost structure** means more magical investment typically yields clearer visions, but **"results are never guaranteed."**

**Temporal Paradox Effects**: The **"mere act of looking into the future is more than enough to change it,"** creating inherent instability in prophetic accuracy. This temporal feedback loop makes Foretelling most useful for understanding general trends rather than specific predictive details.

### Cultural Perception & Mystical Applications
**Public Skepticism**: **"Few take foretellings seriously"** due to the technique's unreliability, leading to its association with **"mystics and soothsayers to pilfer money from the gullible."** This cultural perception masks the ability's genuine but limited utility for experienced practitioners.

**Narrative Fiat Mechanics**: Results **"vary from vague feelings, to dreams and visions, to crystal clear viewing of a moment in the future"** depending on magical investment, time expenditure, and the significance of events being foretold, with more important events being easier to perceive prophetically.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary

**Time Cost**:
Arbitrary

**Description**:
Spend an arbitrary amount of MP and time to attempt to foresee future events. Quality and accuracy of visions depend on the amount of MP spent, and are *usually* better than guessing, but are generally not reliable and are open to interpretation.

Few take foretellings seriously. It is most often used by mystics and soothsayers to pilfer money from the gullible.

**Description**:
Spend an arbitrary amount of MP and time to attempt to foresee future events. Quality and accuracy of visions depend on the amount of MP spent, and are better than guessing, but are generally not reliable and are open to interpretation.

Results are -never- guaranteed, and the mere act of looking into the future is more than enough to change it.

**QM Notes**:
Results are completely up to narrative fiat. Results can vary from vague feelings, to dreams and visions, to crystal clear viewing of a moment in the future that would have occurred had the caster not used Foretelling. As a general guideline, more time spent equates to having more of an idea of "when" a vision refers to, and more magic spent means a clearer vision and a better idea of what the vision refers to. The significance of events foretold is also correlated reliably with both quantities.
