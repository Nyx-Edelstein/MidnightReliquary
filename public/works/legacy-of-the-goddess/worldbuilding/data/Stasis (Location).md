## Story Integration

### Historical Divine Intervention
**Chapter 3 "Frozen Armies" Folklore**: The story of **Hylia freezing two opposing armies** appears in **royal artifact catalogues** as **"The Frozen Armies"** folklore, described as **"Legends say that Hylia once descended from above and froze two entire armies in place until their leaders could agree to an armistice."** The annotation suggests **"Could be linked to tales about the Basilisk's Gaze?"** connecting this to **individual Stasis** techniques.

**Hylian Civil War Context**: The **"formal treaty"** ending mentioned in the description likely refers to historical conflicts during the **early Hylian period** when **territorial disputes** or **succession crises** threatened kingdom stability. **Hylia's direct intervention** would represent **divine enforcement** of **diplomatic resolution** through **supernatural compulsion**.

**Divine Authority Display**: The **scale of intervention** (freezing **entire armies**) demonstrates **Hylia's supreme power** during her **active period** before **Demise's assault**. This **massive display** of divine authority would have **established precedent** for **divine arbitration** of major conflicts and **reinforced royal legitimacy** through **goddess endorsement**.

### Theoretical Magical Applications
**Chapter 21 Lightsworn Manual References**: The **Lightsworn text** acknowledges **"hints in legend of applying this magic at scale to isolate all within an entire volume"** while expressing **deep skepticism** about **practical feasibility**. The manual notes **"the expenditure would be entirely monstrous in scale, well beyond what any mortal could hope to achieve."**

**Collective Magical Requirements**: Historical analysis suggests **"only the combined efforts of the strongest Red Magi in the world could hope to accomplish this feat, and for a small length of time at that."** This indicates **area-effect Stasis** represents the **absolute pinnacle** of **collaborative magical achievement** requiring **unprecedented resource coordination**.

**Lost Divine Capability**: The **theoretical acknowledgment** combined with **practical impossibility** for **mortal practitioners** establishes **Stasis (Location)** as **exclusively divine magic** that **cannot be replicated** through **conventional magical training** or **coordinated effort**. Only **Hylia herself** possessed **sufficient power** for **large-scale temporal manipulation**.

### Civil War Resolution Mechanisms
**Conflict De-escalation**: The ability to **freeze opposing forces** provided **ultimate diplomatic tool** for **forcing negotiation** without **permanent casualty escalation**. **Temporal suspension** created **neutral negotiation environment** where **neither side** could **gain military advantage** during **treaty discussions**.

**Divine Neutrality Enforcement**: **Hylia's intervention** established **supernatural arbitration** principle where **divine authority** could **override military conflict** to **enforce peaceful resolution**. This **precedent** would have **significant impact** on **future conflict resolution** and **royal authority** claims.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Folklore Status Accuracy**: **Chapter 3** classification as **"folklore"** with **skeptical annotation** aligns with the **"fabled"** description, indicating this **historical event** has become **legendary** rather than **documented fact** in **modern understanding**.

**Technical Specifications**: QM data mechanics for **volume-based costs** and **meditation requirements** match the **"monstrous scale"** power requirements described in **Chapter 21** theoretical analysis, confirming **mathematical impossibility** for **mortal practitioners**.

**Divine Magic Classification**: The **exclusive association** with **Hylia** rather than **Lightsworn practitioners** confirms this as **divine-only capability**, distinguishing it from **individual Stasis** which **Lightsworn** could master with **proper empowerment**.

**Historical Authenticity**: The **specific context** of **"ending the Hylian Civil War"** provides **historical anchor** for the legend while **acknowledging uncertainty** about **exact details** or **verifiable documentation**.

## Description

**About**:
**Stasis (Location)** represents the **ultimate expression** of **temporal manipulation magic**, historically demonstrated **only once** by **[[Hylia]]** during a **critical moment** in **early Hylian history**. This **divine intervention** involved **freezing two entire armies** in **temporal suspension** until their leaders could **negotiate a formal treaty**, thus **ending a civil war** through **supernatural compulsion** rather than **military victory**.

**Divine Intervention Scale**: The **intervention** required **Hylia's direct manifestation** and **enormous divine power expenditure** to **lock vast areas** containing **thousands of combatants** in **temporal stasis**. The **volume requirements** and **individual lock costs** for **army-scale application** would exceed **all mortal magical capabilities** combined, establishing this as **exclusively divine magic**.

**Conflict Resolution Mechanism**: By **freezing both armies** simultaneously, **Hylia** created a **neutral negotiation environment** where **neither side** could **gain tactical advantage** or **continue hostilities**. The **temporal suspension** lasted **until formal diplomatic resolution** was achieved, demonstrating **divine enforcement** of **peaceful conflict resolution**.

**Technical Requirements**: The ability demands **meditation time** equal to the **volume in cubic meters**, making **large-scale applications** require **extended preparation periods**. **Maintenance costs** of **10 MP per cubic meter plus individual lock costs** create **exponentially increasing power requirements** that **surpass mortal capabilities** for **meaningful areas**.

**Theoretical Analysis**: **Lightsworn manuals** acknowledge the **theoretical possibility** of **collaborative area-effect Stasis** while **categorically rejecting practical feasibility**. Even **"the strongest Red Magi in the world"** working together could achieve only **"small areas"** for **"small lengths of time,"** confirming the **Hylian Civil War intervention** required **divine power levels**.

**Legendary Status**: The **historical event** has become **folklore** due to **lack of contemporary documentation** and the **impossibility** of **replication** by **modern practitioners**. **Scholarly debate** continues regarding **connections** to **individual Stasis** techniques and **historical accuracy**.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
10 * volume<sub>m<sup>3</sup></sub> enclosed
+ Cost of locking individuals contained within
+ 20 MP / minute (maintenance)

**Time Cost**:
Seconds equal to the volume<sub>m<sup>3</sup></sub> enclosed

**Description**:
Lock a location in temporal stasis. All persons or objects initially contained in the affected volume will remain affected if the spell succeeds, but any new persons or objects which cross the stasis boundary will be unaffected.

Must be maintained or the effect is lost. Maintenance requires some minimal amount of concentration to be spent.
