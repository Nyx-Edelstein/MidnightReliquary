## Story Integration

### Fi's Communication Enhancement
**Chapter 3 Explanation**: **[[Fi]]** describes this as her **highest-cost communication option**: **"With substantially higher cost, I am able to manifest myself in an ethereal form that allows for communication with any being in this realm."** This establishes **Create Ethereal Avatar** as **universal communication** capability not limited to **marked individuals**.

**Damage Vulnerability**: Fi specifically notes the **fragility limitation**: **"this form is somewhat delicate and is easily dispersed with physical or magical force."** This creates **tactical vulnerability** where **enemy attacks** can **disrupt ethereal communication** by **damaging the avatar**.

**Cost vs. Functionality Trade-off**: The **100 per hour** cost makes **extended ethereal manifestation** extremely expensive compared to **[[Create Intangible Avatar]]** at **10 per hour**, creating **resource management** pressure for **universal communication** needs.

### Practical Applications in Story
**Chapter 23 Enemy Interaction**: Fi uses **ethereal form** to **communicate with non-marked individuals** including **hostile entities**, demonstrating the **universal visibility** and **communication capability** that justifies the **higher cost structure**.

**Chapter 30 Mana Device Integration**: Fi's **"chromatic vapors trailed from her ethereal form into the device"** shows **ethereal avatars** can **interact with magical objects** and **channel power**, confirming the **"limited interaction"** includes **magical ability usage**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Void Magic Classification**: As **old-magic-ability**, Create Ethereal Avatar represents **pre-creation manifestation power** accessible to **entities** like **[[Fi]]** but not **standard chromatic mages**. This maintains **Entity vs. Mage** capability distinction.

**Universal Communication**: The **"visible to whomever you wish"** specification enables **selective visibility** for **tactical communication** while maintaining **universal accessibility** when needed for **diplomatic** or **emergency contact**.

**Damage Dissipation**: The **vulnerability to physical/magical damage** prevents **ethereal avatars** from **tanking damage** while preserving **communication functionality** and **limited magical interaction** capabilities.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
100 per hour

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Create an avatar visible to whomever you wish. The avatar has limited interaction with the world (can use abilities and magic), but will dissipate if damaged.
