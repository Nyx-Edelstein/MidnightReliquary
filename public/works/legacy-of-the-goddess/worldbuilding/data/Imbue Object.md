## Story Integration

### Comprehensive Story Applications
**Link's Combat Enhancement**: Throughout the story, **Link's weapons receive Imbue enhancement** from **Ryn** for increased effectiveness. **Chapter 16** confirms **imbued weapons maintain enhancement** even when **carried by different users**, demonstrating **object-bound rather than caster-bound** magical storage. **Ryn's superior duration** creates **tactical advantage** for **team coordination**.

**Magical Defense Verification**: **Chapter 10** confirms **imbued objects deflect magical attacks** as specified, with **Zelda noting "any mundane object imbued with enough magic can deflect magic attacks."** This validates **defensive applications** against **Energy Burst** and other **magical threats**.

**Zelda's Magic Rod Experiments**: **Chapter 23** demonstrates **advanced Imbue applications** where **Zelda creates magnetized iron rod** then **"imbues it with magic until it is heightened to a more conceptually pure form"** using **"a little over a third of her reserves."** The **"faint green glow"** confirms **chromatic correspondence** and **conceptual enhancement** mechanics.

### Ancient Artifact Integration
**Niesis's Chromatic Opal Scepter**: **Chapter 7 and 19** reference **ancient scepter** designed as **"conduit to channel Divine Power"** with **opal acting as focus**. This suggests **high-level Imbue applications** combined with **Divine Power enhancement** can create **powerful channeling artifacts** capable of **imprisoning supernatural entities**.

**Historical Magic Rod Validation**: **Chapter 23** confirms **"Energy bursts are a well-known and widely used application of magic"** and acknowledges **"knowledge of how to"** create **magic rods storing magical energy** has been **"lost, and yet to be rediscovered."** This validates **Imbue Object** as **foundation technology** for **ancient magical artifacts**.

**Triforce Fragment Incompatibility**: **Chapter 19** confirms **Triforce fragments "can't be suffused with Divine Power"** and **"doesn't work with Imbue either,"** establishing **artifact enhancement limitations** where **divine artifacts** resist **standard magical enhancement** methods.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Prismatic Magic Classification**: As **universal magical technique**, Imbue Object functions **identically across all chromatic affinities** while displaying **corresponding color emissions**. This enables **any magical practitioner** to enhance **objects** regardless of **specific affinity limitations**.

**Conceptual Purity Mechanics**: The **"sword becomes sharper, rock becomes harder"** enhancement represents **optimization toward ideal function** rather than **arbitrary power increase**. This creates **logical enhancement patterns** where **objects improve** in **purpose-relevant ways**.

**Sentience Thresholds**: The **1000 MP sentience** and **10,000 MP decision-making** thresholds establish **artificial intelligence creation** through **magical imbuing**. **Creator influence scaling** with **magical investment** prevents **uncontrolled sentient artifact** creation while enabling **deliberate consciousness development**.

**Magical Decay Prevention**: **Slow magical decay** creates **limited-duration enhancements** requiring **periodic recharging** or **replacement**. This maintains **economic balance** where **imbued items** provide **temporary advantages** without **permanent magical superiority**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary cost

**Time Cost**:
~ 1 sec / 1 MP imbued

**Description**:
Imbues a nonliving object with Magic Power. Imbued objects can deflect or negate attacks from Energy Burst (depending on the form of the burst) if imbued with comparable magic to the attack.

As more magic is used, the object will emit a faint glow corresponding to the type of magic used, and will become more a "conceptually pure" version of itself. For instance, a sword will become sharper, a rock will become harder, a pen will take longer to run dry, and a torch will burn brighter and longer with a steadier flame. This effect is noticeable, but usually minor.

Objects imbued with more than 1000 MP may become sentient and, with intelligence increasing roughly proportionally to MP. More than 10,000 MP is necessary for the object to be capable of making it's own decisions. The imbuer has more influence over this the more magic used.

The magic stored will decay slowly over time. Once the magic is spent, the object reverts to normal. 

**QM Notes**:
Inspiration for sentience idea is drawn from *Warbreaker*, and in particular, [Nightblood](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nightblood).
