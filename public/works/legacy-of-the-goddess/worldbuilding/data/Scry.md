## Story Integration

### Strategic Intelligence & Communication Network
**Royal Communication System**: Scrying forms the backbone of Hyrule's long-distance communication infrastructure, with **[[Zelda]]** and **[[Laylith]]** demonstrating coordinated **Scry-Telepathy relay systems** (Chapter 14). The process involves scrying to the **"makeshift Scry-tower"** approximately **fifty kilometers away**, establishing telepathic contact to outline message contents, then transmitting **"exact encoded messages to be transcribed and relayed at the other end."**

**Military Reconnaissance Applications**: Blue Magic specialists use Scrying for battlefield intelligence gathering and threat assessment, with the ability to **"freely move the scried location at roughly 10 meters per second"** enabling dynamic surveillance capabilities. Enhanced movement speed costs **"an additional X MP"** for **"X*50 meters per second (to a maximum of 1km/s)"** until halted.

### Triforce of Wisdom Enhancement Comparison
**Fragment-Based Scrying Differences (Chapter 31)**: Zelda observes that **"Scrying with the Triforce fragments wasn't the same as with Blue magic."** While Blue Magic Scrying creates **"a whole-body sensation of being displacedâ€”unanchored and falling through the sky,"** Triforce scrying **"simply needed to meditate with the intention of invoking that power, using the fragments as a focus. It was intuitive and easy, and required no training."**

**Enhanced Capabilities**: The **fourth [[Triforce of Wisdom]] fragment** grants **"Scry at will any location she had recently visited,"** substantially expanding beyond the **single fragment ability** to **"Scry the location of closely bonded individuals."** This progression demonstrates how fragment accumulation enhances scrying range and targeting flexibility.

### Technical Innovation & Combination Techniques
**Foretelling-Scrying Synthesis (Chapter 30)**: Zelda develops an innovative technique combining **[[Foretelling]]** with Scrying to **"discern whether or not Scrying into any given area would be successful before actually taking the time to Scry, thereby saving considerable time and effort."** Her **"initial tests were a resounding success"** with **"four trials locating the rock on the first try."**

**Training Validation**: [[Laylith]] successfully replicates the technique, **"succeeding twice in a row,"** confirming that the innovation works beyond Zelda's unique capabilities or Triforce fragment advantages. This establishes Foretelling-Scrying combination as a teachable advanced technique.

### Physical Limitations & Usage Challenges
**Sky Requirement**: Scrying **"does not work if not open an under sky,"** creating significant limitations for underground operations, indoor surveillance, or enclosed area reconnaissance. This restriction likely explains why alternative communication methods like the **[[Blindscrier]]** technology development became necessary.

**Physical Discomfort**: Users experience **"strong 'downwards' pull the whole time, similar to the sensation of falling"** with **"head involuntarily jerking back and eyes going white and luminescent for the duration."** The technique is **"generally agreed that this is not a pleasant sensation, and it takes significant practice to use this ability in any useful capacity."**

### Telepathy Integration & Range Enhancement
**Distance Calculation Synergy**: When combined with **[[Telepathy]]**, **"distance to the target is determined by Min(distance from user, distance from scried location),"** enabling effective long-range communication by positioning the scrying viewpoint closer to telepathic targets than the caster's physical location.

**Practical Communication Solutions**: The Scry-Telepathy combination enables reliable communication across the **fifty-kilometer distances** mentioned in Chapter 14, overcoming standard telepathy range limitations through strategic scrying positioning.

### Cost Structure & Resource Management
**Distance-Based Pricing**: **"5 * distance(km) (initial)"** cost with **"10 per minute (channel)"** and **"Minimum initial cost of 10 MP (equivalent to scrying 2 km out)"** creates predictable resource expenditure for mission planning and magical resource allocation.

**Activation Timing**: **"3 seconds to activate, plus one second for every additional km (linear)"** provides tactical timing considerations for combat or emergency situations requiring rapid intelligence gathering.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
5 * distance<sub>km</sub> (initial)

10 per minute (channel)

Minimum initial cost of 10 MP (equivalent to scrying 2 km out)

**Time Cost**:
3 seconds to activate, plus one second for every additional km (linear)

**Description**:
Scry at the target location, seeing as if viewing from 10-100 meters above. The caster will feel a strong "downwards" pull the whole time, similar to the sensation of falling. Does not work if not open an under sky.

Upon activation, the caster's head will involuntarily jerk back, and their eyes will go white and luminescent for the duration of the channel. It is generally agreed that this is not a pleasant sensation, and it takes significant practice to use this ability in any useful capacity.

While active, the caster can freely move the scried location at roughly 10 meters per second. For an additional X MP, this can be increased by X*50 meters per second (to a maximum of 1km/s) until halted.
