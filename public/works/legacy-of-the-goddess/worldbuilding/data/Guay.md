## Story Integration

### Triforce Fragment Security Threat
**Magical Artifact Theft**: Guay's compulsion to collect "rupees and jewelry to small pieces of arms and armor" represents a **systematic security threat** to magical artifacts and Triforce fragments. Their **indiscriminate collection behavior** could result in **critical strategic items** being carried to **inaccessible nest locations**.

**Demonstrated Theft Incident**: **Chapter 32** shows a **Takkuri** (related species) successfully stealing **Link's Triforce necklace** during a critical moment, demonstrating how avian kleptomania can compromise **essential magical equipment** and **divine artifacts** during dangerous situations.

### Ecosystem Role & Character Interactions
**Pet-Keeping Operations**: The note that "less scrupulous types keep them as pets for this reason" suggests **criminal networks** or **unethical merchants** might utilize trained Guay for **organized theft operations**, creating potential **urban security challenges** in settlements like **[[Castletown]]**.

**Scavenging Networks**: Their **swarm behavior** and **omnivorous diet** make them valuable **battlefield cleanup crews** and **information sources** about recent conflicts, as they would be attracted to **combat aftermath** and **abandoned equipment**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Avian Behavioral Consistency**: Aligns with other corvid-like behaviors demonstrated by **[[Kargarok]]** (aerial predation) and observed bird intelligence in the story world. The **mating display** aspect of shiny object collection adds biological realism to their kleptomania.

**Environmental Integration**: Their presence in **towns** alongside **wild environments** suggests **urban-wildlife adaptation**, fitting established settlement patterns where **natural creatures** interact with **human populations** through scavenging and opportunistic behavior.

## Description
**Classification**:
Avian
**Size**:
Small
**Diet**:
Omnivore
**Strategy**:
Scavenging, Swarm Predation
**Environments**:
Forests, Grasslands, Hills, Riverlands, Swamps, Towns

**About**:
Small, dark birds with long, curved beaks. They survive mostly via scavenging, although often they will lie in wait, and swarm small animals or wounded creatures when given an opportunity. Although they act aggressively from a distance (or when in groups), they are decidedly skittish, and will flee at the first sign of active resistance.

They are fond of collecting shiny objects, which they will return to their nest to present to their mates. They have been known to abscond with random valuables ranging from rupees and jewelry to small pieces of arms and armor. Some less scrupulous types keep them as pets for this reason.

**Behavioral Patterns**: **Opportunistic intelligence** combined with **social coordination** enables both **scavenging efficiency** and **targeted theft operations**. **Flight response** to active resistance suggests **learned behavior** from encounters with **armed personnel** and **magical defenses**.

**Nesting Security**: **Nest locations** serve as **concentration points** for **stolen valuables**, potentially creating **treasure hoards** accessible to those willing to **track and raid** Guay colonies, though **defensive swarm behavior** would complicate such operations.
