## Story Integration

**Note**: This entry appears to be an early reference to the character later developed as "Allanah" in the full story. The core identity and role remain consistent.

Allanah serves as one of the most complex figures in the Sheikah organization's tragic downfall and transformation. As Vian's second lieutenant alongside Vesyrn, she represents the tension between traditional Sheikah loyalty and the moral compromises required by the decade-long conspiracy to protect Hyrule from supernatural manipulation.

### Character Development
- **Conspiracy Participant**: Directly involved in false flag operations against Gerudo border positions under Vian's orders
- **Moral Conflict**: Maintained traditional Crown loyalty while participating in deception operations against King Gaillard
- **Ultimate Sacrifice**: Executed Vian at his direct command to prevent conspiracy exposure when the plan collapsed
- **Operational Continuity**: Faked her own death to continue intelligence operations in Old Kingdom ruins

### Key Story Events
- **Chapter 2**: Reported missing during the siege, presumed dead by most characters
- **Chapter 14**: Confirmed alive through intelligence reports
- **Chapter 23**: Intelligence activities continue while maintaining cover
- **Chapter 29**: Ongoing operations revealed
- **Chapter 33**: Full conspiracy details emerge, including her role in Vian's execution

### Ideological Position
Represents the traditional Sheikah philosophy of stability maintenance over intervention, contrasting with Vesyrn's intercession approach. Her loyalty remained with Crown authority even while participating in operations designed to protect the realm from supernatural subversion.

### Relationships
- **Vian**: Superior officer who entrusted her with the conspiracy's most difficult decisions
- **Vesyrn**: Fellow lieutenant whose intercession philosophy she opposed
- **Queen Zelda**: Ultimate authority figure whose direct commands she follows despite operational complications

## Description
One of [[Vian]]'s lieutenants and a high-ranking member of the [[Sheikah]]. Later revealed as a key figure in the decade-long conspiracy to protect Hyrule from supernatural manipulation, ultimately sacrificing her commander and faking her own death to continue critical intelligence operations.

## Cross-References
- **[[Vian]]** - Superior commander, conspiracy mastermind, executed on his orders
- **[[Vesyrn]]** - Fellow lieutenant, ideological opposite, intercession advocate
- **[[Sheikah]]** - Organization, command structure, loyalty conflicts
- **[[Zelda]]** - Queen, ultimate authority, direct command source
- **[[Impa]]** - Organizational member, shared service dedication
- **[[Old Kingdom]]** - Operational theater, intelligence gathering location

## Canonical Reconciliation
The character name "Allanna" in early worldbuilding materials corresponds to "Allanah" in the final story. All narrative references use the latter spelling, and this entry should be understood as referring to the same individual. The core identity as Vian's loyal lieutenant and conspiracy participant remains consistent across all references.
