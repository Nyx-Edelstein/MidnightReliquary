## Story Integration

### Foundational Cultural Role
Hylians represent the primary civilization and cultural lens through which the story unfolds. As Hylia's chosen people, they embody the central tension between divine heritage and mortal limitations, with their governance, religious practices, and social structures forming the foundation for all major story conflicts.

### Government & Political Structure
**Story Confirmation**: The complex governmental system described in the worldbuilding entries is actively demonstrated throughout the story:
- **The Queen's Council** features prominently with Countess Lensa (House of Nobles) and Prime Counselor Taetus (House of Commons) as major recurring characters
- **Military Hierarchy** functions as described, with Lord General Wymar commanding forces and regional High Captains managing territorial defenses
- **The Queen's Law/Justice** system operates through Chancellors Nyllara and Adresin as established judicial authorities

### Religious & Social Integration
**Faith-Based Society**: The extensive religious framework proves central to story conflicts:
- **Hylia's Death Secret** creates fundamental tension between public doctrine and hidden truth
- **Seeker Operations** against Fae represent ongoing security threats requiring constant vigilance
- **Sage Authority** through figures like Vestele and Chalia provides crucial supernatural expertise
- **Magic Users** in Church/Military/Aristocracy follow predicted patterns with characters like Zelda and Sage Amaurath

### Cultural Characteristics Confirmed
**Physical Traits**: Story evidence supports described Hylian characteristics:
- Shorter stature relative to other fantasy humans (though not explicitly detailed in narrative)
- Pointed ears and elf-like appearance implied through character descriptions
- Extended lifespans allowing multi-generational political relationships

**Magical Heritage**: The 1-in-5 magical affinity rate with 1-in-20 having practical utility aligns with story distribution:
- Royal bloodline shows exceptional magical capability (Zelda's comprehensive affinities)
- Noble houses demonstrate inherited magical tendencies
- Military and religious institutions recruit magically capable individuals

### Economic & Military Patterns
**Agricultural Foundation**: The kingdom's agricultural base supports story logistics:
- Provincial taxation systems enable military funding
- Caravan-based trade networks explain communication delays and travel risks
- Deadly wildlife threats justify military positioning and fortified settlements

**Military Service Culture**: The expectation of male military service reflects in character backgrounds and social expectations throughout the narrative.

## Description
### Overview
* Peoples created by the Goddess [[Hylia]] in her image shortly after the Golden Goddesses left the realm in her control
* Are basically humans except:
    * Shorter and smaller on average than real-life humans:
        * Average for females is around 130 cm and 45kg
        * Average for males is 140cm and 65kg
    * Average lifespan is about 120 years. However, they are biologically are capable of living 200-250 years. They reach maturity in their mid-20’s and remain fertile until well into their early 100’s.
    * Vaguely elf-like in appearance
* Roughly 1 in 5 have magical affinity, and roughly 1 in 20 of those have strong enough affinity to be practically useful. These individuals invariably find themselves as part of the Church, Military, or Aristocracy.
* As there is no disease in Hyrule and magical healing is fairly common, Hylians rarely die of any natural causes except old age. By far the most common cause of death is violent conflict, usually at the hands (or rather teeth and claws) of Hyrule’s insanely deadly wildlife

### Religion
Hylians ubiquitously (as well as some sects of other races) hold to a religion centered around faith in Hylia as the creator of the Hylians and the protector of all creation. The religion has no official name, but is often referred to as simply “[[The Faith]],” both by Hylians and other races. Core tenants of The Faith extol personal virtue as embodied by Hylia and the Golden Goddesses, and preach that all of Hylia’s children must seek to honor their “Mother Goddess” by dutifully fulfilling their calling, whatever it may be.

The religion is headed by a High Priestess and High Bishop, with the High Priestess being the official leader and ultimate authority in the church, and the High Bishop heading the day-to-day organization and logistics. Each church mirrors this structure, being lead by a Priestess in matters of Faith, and being administered by a Bishop. It is not uncommon for a Priestess and Bishop to be a married couple.

Additionally, there are seven individuals entrusted by the Faith with the protection and preservation of ancient artifacts, said to be handed down by Hylia herself. These individuals are known as [[Sages]], and are carefully chosen by the clergy to ensure they are paragons of virtue and capable of fulfilling this task. Each Sage has their own order of Abbots who assist them and attend to their needs. (Only three of the current Sages are Hylian)

The truth of Hylia’s demise is a well-guarded secret, known only to [[the Order of Sages]], the upper levels of the clergy in the Faith, and their trusted inner sects. This knowledge is kept from the general populace, as they fear that knowing this truth would lead to the ruin of Hylian civilization. To this end, the Faith employs highly trained “[[Seekers]]” to covertly suss out any rumors of [[Fae]], and to capture, bind, and banish them from Hylian lands, as well as to hunt down rogue [[Mage]]s. A few more cooperative Fae have been retained from time to time, and are used by the church to produce miracles, renewing the faith and devotion of the people.

### Governance
The King or Queen of Hyrule has absolute dominion over its peoples, save only for the edicts of the Faith. Historically, there has often been tension between the reigning monarch and the High Priestess, though they have always been careful to present a unified front to the public.

The monarchy delegates its powers of governance in various ways and to various stations. Within the province of [[Castletown]], there are three major divisions:
* The King’s (Queen’s) Law
    * Responsible for:
        * Maintaining the written law
        * Determining when a crime has been committed, who is responsible, and to what degree
        * Adjudicating disagreements between private citizens
    * Is lead by an individual who holds the title, “The King’s Law,” but power is delegated to many “Magistrates”
* The King’s (Queen’s) Justice
    * Responsible for:
        * Enforcing the law and upholding public order
        * Seeing criminals prosecuted and arguing their guilt before the Law
        * Determining the punishments for breaking the law
    * Also lead by an individual who holds the title, “The King’s Justice,” and is delegated appropriately to various “Justicars”
* The King’s (Queen’s) Council:
    * Deliberates with the monarch on matters of policy and provides guidance and insight into the needs and desires of the populace
    * Comprised of the House of Nobles and the House of Commons.
        * One representative of each Noble house (there are exactly twenty) is appointed to the House of Nobles, and may attend the Council meetings. They choose among them a single Head to officially represent their interests to the monarch.
        * Affluent and influential citizens (usually merchants, heroes, or popular artists) may be appointed to the House of Commons. Every two years, candidates seeking such a position may petition the citizens of Castletown for their support. Twelve candidates are chosen by moot, where interested citizens gather and cheer for the candidates they want to win. Winners are decided by the King’s Law. As with the House of Nobles, Commons may attend council meetings and appoint a single head to officially represent their interests to the monarch.

Within the provinces of [[Kakariko]] and [[Hateno]], a governor or governess is appointed, who has free reign to administer as they see fit. They are, however, still beholden to the King, the King’s Law, and the King’s Justice.

### Military
Although the realm has more recently enjoyed an era of relative peace and prosperity, the Kingdom of Hyrule has maintained a sizable standing army since its inception. The primary function of the military is simply a display of strength, intended to ward off threats from surrounding regions -- from the [[Gerudo]], [[Lizalfos]], [[Lynel]], and [[Blin]] territories. In practice however, the only day-to-day threats are skirmishes by the occasional Blin warband or raiding party.

The King or Queen of Hyrule is the supreme commander of the military, though they often defer to the expertise of their General (who is themselves usually a close relative of the Royal Family). Each location ([[City Guard]], [[Talus]], [[Last Bastion]], and [[Hylia's Watch]]) is overseen by a High Captain and their First Lieutenant. Forces are further broken down into Battalions of a few hundred to a thousand soldiers each, and lead by a Captain and their Lieutenant. The lowest level of organization is individual, self-sufficient Companies of varying size (usually a few dozen), overseen by a Sergeant Major and several assistant Sergeants.

Due to the Hylian’s far superior organization and coordination, the [[Blin]] do not really stand much of a chance against any coordinated Hylian force. However, in smaller fights or one-vs-one, most Blin will easily win due to a significant advantage in size and strength. All-in-all, this is a much safer occupation than one would initially expect, with only a few hundred deaths incurred by the Hylians each year (predominantly newer recruits).

Although not strictly required, all males are expected to serve time in Hyrule’s military once they come of age. Abstaining from service is considered a moral failing, and those who do not serve at least a few years are viewed as weak, selfish, and irresponsible. It is not uncommon for women to also serve, though those who do are definitely a minority.

Standard practice is for most military personnel to rotate between active duty and home-life, with the most common rotation being one year of service for each two years in reserve. Roughly 16% of the population is currently enlisted, with about one third of that in active duty at any given time. Fairly common is for reserve personnel to take up jobs as city and town guards; those who take this path are not required to rotate to other assignments except in emergency situations.

### Economy
The Kingdom of Hyrule is primarily an agricultural economy, with the majority of individuals being farmers, hunters, fishers, or ranch-hands of some type (in addition to males serving in the military on rotation). Other professions, in order of frequency, include:
* Forestry
* Mining
* Crafting (blacksmiths, leather workers, carpenters, masonry, clothiers, etc.)
* Service (housemaids, innkeeps, cooks, guards, etc.)
* Merchantry
* Entertainment and Art
* Law &amp; Governance (within cities)
* Academia &amp; Magical Study (rare)

Aside from subsistence, the chief consumer of economic production is the military. Each province is taxed (primarily in food and goods) biannually to provide for governance and military upkeep. The exact rate varies depending on need, location, and type of holding, but is usually between 5% and 15% of value. Taxation and census is rarely administered directly by the government, and is usually contracted out to the highest bidder. As long as the amount expected by Law is delivered, contractors may do with excess as they wish. Claims of abuse and corruption are occasionally audited by the King’s Justice.

As the wilderness is unforgiving and exceptionally deadly to unprepared individuals, very few people travel when not accompanied by a large caravan and dozens of armed guards. Towns and cities are invariably walled and gated, and villages are larger and more clustered than they would be otherwise. Great pains are taken to protect livestock and crops, with several layers of defensive fortifications Still, intrusions and attacks from wild creatures are common, resulting in loss of production, serious injury and sometimes death. (This is by far the most common cause of death for Hylians)

Caravans usually leave each month to nearby towns, and more regularly between cities. Banditry and piracy of smaller and less protected caravans are not uncommon, especially in times of hardship.

**Government Operations**: The complex system of Queen's Law/Justice, Council structures, and provincial governance operates exactly as described throughout the story.

**Religious Hierarchy**: The Faith's structure, Sage roles, and Seeker operations function as detailed in worldbuilding, with the Hylia death secret driving major plot conflicts.

**Social Stratification**: Magical affinity distribution, military service expectations, and noble house dynamics all manifest consistently in character relationships and societal functions.

**Economic Systems**: Agricultural base, taxation through contractors, caravan trade, and territorial defense requirements support story logistics and political tensions.

**CANONICAL CONFIRMATION**: This entry represents the foundational cultural framework that supports all story elements without conflicts. The detailed governmental, religious, and social systems provide essential context for understanding character motivations and plot developments.
