## Description
**Species**: Blin  
**Title**: Warlord of the Plains  
**Allegiance**: Ganondorf (under submission)  
**Status**: Active military commander  

Kurruk the Red stands as one of the most formidable Blin warlords in Hyrule's history, originally commanding the largest tribal confederation on the Plains before his defeat and subsequent submission to Ganondorf. His distinctive red coloring and fierce reputation earned him his epithet among both allies and enemies.

## Story Integration
**Canonical Context**: As a major Blin warlord bearing a Triforce shard, Kurruk represents the militaristic expansion of Ganondorf's forces beyond traditional Gerudo boundaries. His submission demonstrates Ganondorf's ability to unite disparate monster tribes under his banner.

**Narrative Role**: Kurruk serves as a significant military antagonist, commanding substantial Blin forces while wrestling with his forced allegiance to Ganondorf. His possession of a Triforce shard makes him a high-value target and potential source of divine power.

## Canonical Reconciliation
**Power Hierarchy**: Kurruk's defeat by Ganondorf with Big Bis's aid establishes clear power dynamics within the monster hierarchy. His continued command of Blin forces suggests Ganondorf values his leadership capabilities despite his subordinate status.

**Triforce Connection**: The Triforce of Power shard embedded in his ring indicates Ganondorf's trust in Kurruk's loyalty, while also serving as both a symbol of authority and a potential means of control.

## Cross-References

**Strategic Significance**: 
- Key military asset in Ganondorf's conquest campaigns
- Guardian of Triforce shard - high-value target
- Potential point of rebellion if loyalty wavers
