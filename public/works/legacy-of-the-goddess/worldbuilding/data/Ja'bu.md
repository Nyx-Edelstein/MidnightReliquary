## Story Integration

### Central Cosmic Threat & Domain Corruption
**Ja'bu Attack on Zora's Domain (Chapters 12-13)**: Ja'bu represents the fulfillment of **[[Zelda]]**'s prophetic dreams about cosmic threats to Zora territory. The attack **"turned" a large group of Zora** while forcing the majority to flee, creating a massive refugee crisis that overwhelms Hylian borders and resources. This corruption demonstrates Ja'bu's ability to **transform living beings into void-aligned entities**, representing one of the most dangerous void powers.

**River Hylia Reversal**: The success of Ja'bu's attack triggers supernatural consequences, causing **the River Hylia to flow backwards** as a mystical indicator that **cosmic barriers have been breached** and reality-altering forces have been unleashed beyond political conflict into **cosmic threat territory**.

### Golvara's Intelligence & Ancient Warnings
**"A Great Evil Long Thought Dormant" (Chapter A2)**: **[[Golvara]]** describes Ja'bu using this exact phrase when **[[Zelda]]** seeks information about her prophetic dreams. Despite having advance warning through divine visions, Golvara **refuses to provide additional details** and dismissively assures Zelda **"not to worry and that it would be handled"** - a catastrophic underestimation of the threat level.

**Zora Cultural Knowledge Gap**: The story reveals that **even the Zora "don't fully understand"** Ja'bu's connection to their domain, despite being its guardians. This knowledge gap contributes to inadequate preparation and the eventual breach of protective barriers.

### Strategic Intelligence & Void Network Coordination
**Lizalfos Coordination Network**: **[[Shesan]]** provides intelligence that Ja'bu was **"pulling on the Lizalfos and coordinating with [[Demise]] to free himself,"** indicating sophisticated multi-entity void operations spanning multiple races and regions. This coordination represents **strategic void entity networking** rather than isolated threats.

**Demise Strategic Asset**: Ja'bu functions as **"a powerful tool for Demise"** and **"likely his next project,"** positioning this entity within the broader cosmic conflict as a **recruitment target** and **strategic resource** for multiverse-threatening operations.

### Refugee Crisis & Political Ramifications  
**Massive Displacement Crisis**: Ja'bu's successful attack creates **"thousands of Zora refugees flooding Hylian territory,"** straining already overtaxed resources and creating potential for **civil unrest and diplomatic disasters**. The crisis forces **[[Izu]]** to take emergency command when Zelda initially falters under the weight of fulfilled prophecy.

**Turned Zora Threat Assessment**: The creation of **"turned Zora"** represents a new category of supernatural threat requiring **distinct military assessment protocols** and specialized containment strategies, as these entities retain Zora capabilities while serving void entity objectives.

### Cross-References & Connections
- **[[Faron]]**: Historical victim of Ja'bu's corruption, **"attacked [[Faron]] and managed to drive her mad"** during previous perpendicularity breach
- **[[Ja'bu Cove]]**: Geographic location of the perpendicularity where Ja'bu originally broke through and remains sealed
- **[[Perpendicularity]]**: The dimensional breach point that allowed Ja'bu's initial invasion of this reality
- **[[Hylia]]**: Collaborated with Zora in the original sealing of Ja'bu after its assault on Faron
- **[[Zora]]**: Guardian race responsible for maintaining Ja'bu's seals and monitoring the perpendicularity
- **[[Lizalfos]]**: Void-corrupted race serving as Ja'bu's coordination network for multi-regional operations
- **[[Demise]]**: Strategic coordinator recruiting Ja'bu as a **"powerful tool"** for multiverse conquest
- **[[Voidspawn]]**: General category of void entities; Ja'bu represents a **"massive fishlike void entity"** class
- **[[Zelda]]**: Recipient of prophetic dreams warning of Ja'bu's awakening and the Zora Domain crisis

## Description
Referred to by [[Golvara]] as "a great evil long thought dormant." What could he mean?

## QM Data
Likely pulling on the Lizalfos and coordinating with Demise to free himself. Would be a powerful tool for Demise, so likely his next project.
