## Story Integration

### Stub Entry Status & Canonical Importance
**Critical Cosmic Infrastructure**: Despite being marked as a stub, perpendicularity sites represent **fundamental cosmic infrastructure** serving as **intersection points between realms or worlds** that require **[[Guardian Beast]]** protection and enable **[[Void Between Worlds]]** entity access to reality.

**Systemic Integration**: Perpendicularity sites are integral to multiple major story elements including Guardian Beast protective missions, spatial distortion effects, portal network functionality, and cosmic threat infiltration points.

### Guardian Beast Protection Network
**Three Primary Sites**: The perpendicularity system includes three confirmed major locations:
- **[[Eye of Din]]**: Protected by **[[Eldin]]** (dragon), currently sealed following Rito massacre trauma
- **[[Ja'bu Cove]]**: Formerly protected by **[[Faron]]** (sea serpent), now corrupted by void entity infiltration
- **[[Lost Woods]]**: Managed by **[[Lanayru]]** (kraken), damaged and causing spatial/temporal distortions

**Protective System Design**: Each perpendicularity site requires dedicated **Guardian Beast protection** to prevent **void entity infiltration** and maintain **cosmic barrier integrity**. Guardian failure or corruption compromises regional stability and enables supernatural threats.

### Spatial & Reality Effects
**Lost Woods Distortion**: **[[Lanayru]]**'s damaged perpendicularity creates **"spatial and temporal distortions"** that generate the Lost Woods' **maze-like navigation hazards** and **ever-shifting geography**. This demonstrates how perpendicularity damage affects regional reality stability.

**Quasi-Stable Status**: The Lost Woods perpendicularity is described as **"quasi-stable"** following **[[Hylia]]**'s partial sealing after a **"powerful entity attempted to use it to enter the world."** This partial repair work prevents catastrophic failure while maintaining dangerous instability.

### Void Entity Infiltration Risks
**Ja'bu Corruption Case**: The **[[Ja'bu]]** void entity's successful corruption of **Faron** at the Ja'bu Cove perpendicularity demonstrates how these sites serve as **primary infiltration points** for cosmic threats attempting to access reality from the Void Between Worlds.

**Historical Attack Pattern**: The **powerful entity** that damaged Lanayru's perpendicularity represents another historical infiltration attempt, showing that perpendicularity sites are **consistently targeted by void entities** seeking realm access.

### Strategic & Magical Significance
**Portal Network Integration**: Perpendicularity sites appear connected to **ancient portal infrastructure** enabling long-distance transportation, as suggested by **[[Death Mountain]]** portal connections to **[[Eye of Din]]** and **[[Lightsworn]]** temple network access requirements.

**Triforce Fragment Magnetism**: **[[Triforce of Courage]]** fragments are found at or near perpendicularity sites (**Faron's corrupted location**, **Lanayru's territory**), suggesting these cosmic intersection points attract or concentrate divine power.
