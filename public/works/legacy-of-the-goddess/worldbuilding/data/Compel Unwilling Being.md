## Story Integration

### Enhanced Compulsion Mechanism
**Pain Enforcement System**: Unlike **[[Compel Being]]** which relies on **command reasonableness** and **intelligence-based resistance**, **Compel Unwilling Being** uses **escalating pain** to **overcome resistance**. The **"immense and growing pain"** creates **involuntary compliance** even when **targets intellectually oppose** the **commanded action**.

**Death Ultimatum**: The **"culminating in their death if they completely refuse"** represents **absolute compulsion** through **existential threat**. This transforms **mental resistance** into **survival calculation**, making **complete refusal** a **suicidal choice** rather than **ethical stance**.

**Strategic Terror Applications**: This ability enables **entity users** to **extract compliance** from **marked individuals** who have **turned against** their **benefactor** or **been compromised** by **enemy influence**. The **pain escalation** serves as **both punishment** and **coercion mechanism**.

### Lucia's Possession of Urik
**Chapter 22.1 Documented Usage**: **[[Lucia]]** demonstrates **Compel Unwilling Being** when she **overrides Urik's resistance** to **possess his body** as a **communication vessel**. Urik experiences **visible internal struggle** against the **supernatural compulsion**: **"No! I am not going… No! You can't—UURRRAAAAAGGH!"** followed by **intense pain** as he **"doubled over in pain. He fell to the ground, shaking and holding his head."**

**Complete Override Achievement**: After the **pain escalation**, Urik **"rose to his feet in a single smooth motion, as if lifted from above like a marionette,"** indicating **total compliance** following **resistance punishment**. His **personality completely changes** with **"eyes had glazed over, and his voice sounded different, as if a second voice spoke in unison behind his"** - establishing **Lucia's successful possession**. See also: **[[Wrest Control]]**.

**Possession Duration**: The **compulsion maintains control** throughout **Link's team encounter** with **Ibboso**, demonstrating **sustained effectiveness** of the **unwilling compulsion** over **extended periods** when **targeting vessel creation** rather than **simple task completion**.

### Active Marking Requirement
**Marked Individual Limitation**: The **"active marked individual"** requirement indicates this ability **cannot target random enemies** but only **individuals** who have **accepted** the **[[Mark of Transference]]**. This creates **strategic vulnerability** where **marked allies** become **potential hostages** to **entity compulsion**.

**Experience-Based Cost Scaling**: **"~ Experience of character"** cost structure makes **compelling veteran heroes** extremely expensive while keeping **novice marked individuals** relatively **cost-effective** to **control against their will**. This creates **power hierarchy** within **marked groups**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Marked Individual Constraint**: The **active marking requirement** prevents **arbitrary compulsion** of **random enemies** while creating **dramatic tension** around **voluntary marking** decisions. **Characters** must **balance** the **benefits** of **divine aid** against **potential domination**.

**Pain vs. Death Mechanics**: The **escalating pain** system provides **graduated resistance options** while the **death ultimatum** ensures **absolute compliance** is **theoretically achievable**. This maintains **story tension** without **guaranteeing success** for **entity users**.

**One-Hour Duration**: The **temporal limitation** prevents **permanent mental domination** while enabling **critical tactical applications**. **Targets** retain **long-term autonomy** while facing **short-term** **forced compliance**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Proportional to "power" of the individual

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Compel an active marked individual to do your bidding, even against their will and better judgement. The being will feel immense and growing pain if they attempt to resist, culminating in their death if they completely refuse. The effect ends once the command has been carried out, or after one hour.

**Pain Escalation**: **"Immense and growing pain"** creates **psychological pressure** that **increases over time**, making **prolonged resistance** increasingly **unbearable** while preserving **target choice** between **compliance** and **suffering**.

**Death Enforcement**: **"Culminating in their death"** represents **absolute authority** over **marked individuals**, transforming **resistance** into **life-threatening decision** rather than **simple moral choice**.

**Command Resolution**: **Task completion** or **one-hour duration** provides **clear termination conditions**, preventing **permanent compulsion** while enabling **tactical deployment** during **critical operations**.
