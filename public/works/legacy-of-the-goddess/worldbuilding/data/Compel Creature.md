## Story Integration

### Fi's Creature Control Experiments
**Chapter 11 Practical Application**: **Successful experimentation** with **[[Buzzhopper]]** control demonstrates **Compel Creature** in action: **"Experimenting with using Fi's Compel magic on the buzzhoppers was a success."** The training session **"took up the entirety of the late afternoon"** but achieved **complex behavioral commands** including:
- **Pattern flying** around designated areas
- **Marker following** along predetermined paths  
- **Coordinated swarming** targeting specific individuals
- **Selective ignoring** of environmental distractions

**Command Complexity Scaling**: The **buzzhopper experiments** revealed that **non-sentient creatures** can execute **moderately complex instructions** beyond simple actions, including **conditional behaviors** like **"Start flying when I raise my hand"** and **spatial coordination** commands requiring **environmental awareness**.

### Intelligence-Based Cost Structure
**Creature Intelligence Scaling**: The **"10x intelligence of creature (usually 10-100 total)"** cost structure makes **compelling simple creatures** extremely **cost-effective** compared to **[[Compel Being]]** applications on **intelligent targets**. **Buzzhoppers** likely represent **mid-range intelligence** for **non-sentient creatures**.

**Strategic Applications**: **Chapter 11** demonstrates that **creature compulsion** provides **tactical reconnaissance**, **distraction capabilities**, and **environmental manipulation** through **coordinated animal behavior**. The **one-hour duration** enables **sustained tactical deployment** without **constant reapplication**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Void Magic Classification**: As **old-magic-ability**, Compel Creature represents **pre-creation power** accessible to **entities** like **[[Fi]]** but not **standard chromatic mages**. This maintains **Entity vs. Mage** power distinction and **supernatural threat levels**.

**Non-Sentient Limitation**: The **creature-specific targeting** creates **clear distinction** from **[[Compel Being]]** while providing **accessible applications** for **entity abilities**. **Intelligence scaling** prevents **abuse** on **highly intelligent creatures** that approach **sentient thresholds**.

**Command Reasonableness**: The **"not too complex a task"** limitation ensures **creature behavior** remains **within natural capabilities** while preventing **impossible commands** that would **break suspension** of **magical believability**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
10x intelligence of the creature (usually 10-100 total)

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Compel a non-sentient creature to do your bidding. Provided it is not too complex a task, the creature will follow a single command to completion, or for about an hour.

**Command Limitations**: **"Single command"** restriction prevents **complex multi-step manipulation**, while **"not too complex"** clause ensures **commands remain** within **creature's natural behavioral repertoire** and **cognitive limitations**.

**Duration Mechanics**: **One-hour maximum** or **task completion** creates **tactical time pressure** while preventing **permanent creature domination**. **Instant activation** enables **immediate deployment** during **emergency situations**.

**Intelligence Scaling**: **Cost multiplication** by **creature intelligence** makes **compelling highly intelligent animals** more expensive while keeping **simple creatures** extremely **cost-effective** for **routine applications**.
