## Story Integration

### Ultimate Possession Technique
**Forced Control Mechanism**: **Wrest Control** represents the **most invasive form** of **entity domination**, enabling **complete takeover** of **unwilling targets** without **consent requirements** that limit **[[Assume Control]]**. This makes it the **entity equivalent** of **[[Compel Unwilling Being]]** but with **complete possession** rather than **command compliance**.

**Lucia's Urik Possession**: **Chapter 22.1** demonstrates **Wrest Control** in action when **[[Lucia]]** **completely overrides Urik's resistance** to **possess his body**. The **visible struggle** - **"No! I am not going… No! You can't—UURRRAAAAAGGH!"** - followed by **total personality replacement** shows **Wrest Control's absolute dominance** over **target consciousness**.

**Extended Possession Duration**: **Lucia's control** of **Urik** persists throughout **Link's encounter** with **[[Ibboso]]**, demonstrating **sustained effectiveness** over **extended periods** when **entity maintains concentration**. The **possessed individual** exhibits **complete personality change** with **"eyes had glazed over, and his voice sounded different, as if a second voice spoke in unison behind his."**

### Power Scaling & Strategic Applications
**Experience-Based Cost Structure**: **"Experience of character"** cost scaling makes **possessing veteran heroes** extremely expensive while keeping **novice targets** relatively **cost-effective**, creating **strategic incentive** to **target inexperienced individuals** or **exhaust powerful entities** through **high-cost operations**.

**Marked/Unmarked Equivalence**: Unlike **[[Assume Control]]** which provides **cost reduction** for **marked individuals**, **Wrest Control** applies **identical costs** regardless of **marking status**, indicating the **hostile nature** of the ability **bypasses consent-based optimizations**.

**One-Minute Concentration**: The **extended concentration requirement** creates **tactical vulnerability** where **entity users** must **maintain focus** during **possession**, potentially leaving them **exposed** to **counterattack** or **interruption** during **the takeover process**.

### Hostile Takeover Implications
**No Consent Requirement**: The **unwilling target** specification eliminates **voluntary cooperation** requirements, enabling **combat possession** of **enemy forces** and **hostile takeover** of **strategic targets** without **negotiation** or **manipulation**.

**Complete Consciousness Override**: Unlike **[[Compel Unwilling Being]]** which **forces compliance** while **preserving personality**, **Wrest Control** achieves **total replacement** of **target consciousness** with **entity control**, creating **perfect infiltration** capabilities.

**Strategic Terror Applications**: The ability to **completely possess unwilling targets** provides **psychological warfare** advantages and **infiltration capabilities** that **transcend normal resistance**, making **any individual** a **potential security liability** when **entities** with **sufficient power** are involved.

### QM Mechanics Analysis
**Minimum One-Hour Cost**: The **"Minimum cost as if used for an hour"** specification ensures **even brief possessions** require **substantial investment**, preventing **casual use** for **trivial advantage** while enabling **extended operations** at **predictable costs**.

**Instant Activation**: Despite **one-minute concentration** requirement, the **"Instant"** time cost suggests **immediate takeover** upon **successful concentration**, enabling **rapid deployment** during **tactical opportunities** but requiring **sustained vulnerability** during **casting**.

**Relinquishment Control**: **"Until relinquished"** indicates **voluntary termination** by the **controlling entity**, preventing **automatic expiration** but enabling **strategic withdrawal** when **continued possession** becomes **disadvantageous**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Old Magic Classification**: As **magic-void** ability, **Wrest Control** represents **ultimate possession technique** accessible to **powerful entities** but not **chromatic magic users**, maintaining **Entity vs. Mage** power hierarchy.

**Hostile vs. Cooperative Control**: **Wrest Control** serves as **unwilling counterpart** to **[[Assume Control]]**, providing **forced possession** capabilities for **entities** dealing with **uncooperative targets** or **enemy infiltration**.

**Experience Scaling Logic**: **Cost multiplication** by **target experience** ensures **powerful characters** require **massive investment** to **possess**, maintaining **story balance** while enabling **tactical use** against **appropriate targets**.

**Concentration Vulnerability**: **One-minute casting** creates **strategic risk** for **entity users**, requiring **protection** or **distraction** during **possession attempts** and enabling **countermeasures** through **interruption**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Experience of character

**Time Cost**:
One minute of concentration

**Description**:
Assume direct control of an unwilling individual until relinquished. Cost does not vary between marked and unmarked individuals.

**QM Notes**:
Minimum cost as if used for an hour.
