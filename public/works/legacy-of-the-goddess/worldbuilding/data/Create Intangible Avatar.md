## Story Integration

### Fi's Efficient Communication Method
**Chapter 19 Truth Detection**: Fi confirms **Create Intangible Avatar** enables **"sensing when people are telling the truth versus making some attempt at deception"** alongside **[[Telepathy]]**, demonstrating **investigative applications** beyond simple **communication**.

**Chapter 33 Cost Optimization**: Fi explains **"below a certain threshold, doing the same with Intangible Avatar would incur less cost than the current method"** for **marked individual communication**, making it the **preferred alternative** to **[[Telepathy]]** for **extended conversations** and **group coordination**.

**Voice Mimicry Capability**: Fi notes **"I am capable of attenuating messages I send to mimic the voice of the speaker; however, it will take practice to do so fluently"** through **Intangible Avatar**, enabling **impersonation** and **voice reproduction** for **tactical communication** purposes.

### Communication Limitations & Advantages
**Marked Individual Constraint**: The **"only individuals carrying Hylia's mark would be able to hear me"** restriction creates **security advantage** for **classified communications** while limiting **universal accessibility** compared to **[[Create Ethereal Avatar]]**.

**Cost Efficiency at Scale**: **10 per hour** vs **100 per hour** for ethereal form makes **Create Intangible Avatar** **extremely cost-effective** for **routine coordination** and **extended operations** with **marked team members**.

**Single Avatar Limitation**: Fi's note that she **"can only manifest a single avatar at a time"** applies to **all avatar types**, creating **tactical choice** between **universal communication** (ethereal) and **cost efficiency** (intangible).

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Void Magic Classification**: As **old-magic-ability**, Create Intangible Avatar represents **pre-creation manifestation power** accessible to **entities** like **[[Fi]]** but not **standard chromatic mages**. This maintains **Entity vs. Mage** capability distinction.

**Mark Dependency**: The **marked individual visibility** requirement integrates with **[[Mark of Transference]]** system, creating **strategic value** for **maintaining active marks** while providing **secure communication** channels.

**Communication vs. Interaction**: **"Cannot otherwise interact with the world"** prevents **physical manipulation** or **magical channeling** unlike **[[Create Ethereal Avatar]]**, limiting function to **pure communication** applications.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
10 per hour

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Create an avatar only visible to marked individuals. The avatar cannot otherwise interact with the world.
