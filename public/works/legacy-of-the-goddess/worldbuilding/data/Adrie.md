## Story Integration

### Historical Context & Research Connection
**Zelda's Archaeological Research**: In Chapter 3's research notes, Zelda connects the **"Pendant of Amethyst Sands"** legend to Adrie's actual binding, distinguishing between the mythologized bloodmage Moraga and the historical reality of a powerful spellcaster who utilized this Fae entity's power.

**Gerudo Civil War Period**: The binding's timing coincides with the ancient Hylian-Gerudo conflicts, suggesting Adrie may have been weaponized during those hostilities before the bearer's capture and exile into the **[[Gerudo Wastes]]**.

### Artifact Status & Implications
**Lost to the Sands**: The pendant's disappearance in the Gerudo Wastes creates an ongoing supernatural threatâ€”an uncontained Fae entity bound to a portable artifact that could be discovered by scavengers, raiders, or explorers.

**Blood Magic Connection**: The historical association with blood rituals suggests Adrie may have specialized knowledge of sacrificial magic, potentially making the entity valuable to practitioners of dark arts if the pendant were ever recovered.

### Cross-References
