## Story Integration

**Core Green Magic Ability**: Luck represents a fundamental **Green Magic spell** within the **chromatic magic system**, embodying **goddess Farore's influence** through **probability manipulation** and **protective chance enhancement**. It serves as one of the three primary Green Magic abilities alongside **Heal** and **Soothe**.

### Character Applications & Development

**Link (Lightsworn Champion)**:
- **Chapter 10 Training**: Achieves adequate proficiency in Luck during magical training, though it remains his weakest affinity area compared to Red Magic specialization
- **Tactical Applications**: Often relies on arrows rather than magical bursts for practical combat effectiveness, showing personal preference for physical solutions over probability manipulation
- **Triforce Enhancement**: [[Triforce of Courage]] fragments may amplify Luck effectiveness through enhanced connection to beneficial outcomes

**Green Mage Cultural Integration**:
- **[[Jedal]]**: Demonstrates characteristic Green mage comfort with luck-based decision making, suggesting dice-roll selection for team assignments
- **Traditional Philosophy**: Green mages maintain cultural comfort with fate-driven concepts, random chance acceptance, and trust in beneficial outcomes through magical influence

### Magical System Mechanics & Story Consistency

**Technical Specifications**:
- **MP Cost**: 10 MP per application (fixed cost structure)
- **Duration**: One hour maximum, or until effect consumption through unfavorable outcome prevention  
- **Activation**: One second casting time for immediate deployment
- **Effect**: Allows target to **redo any unfavorable resolution as if it never happened**, providing genuine tactical advantage

**Probability Shell Mechanics**:
- Creates protective magical influence around user affecting chance outcomes favorably
- Works subtly through environmental factor manipulation rather than dramatic reality alteration
- Effect consumed upon triggering, requiring reapplication for sustained protection

### Advanced Applications & Combat Integration

**Master Zobor's "Opportunity" Technique** (Chapter 21, 26):
- Advanced Luck application referenced in historical combat manuscripts showing enhanced effectiveness
- Demonstrates mindset component requiring confidence in victory while maintaining magical backing
- Shows potential for Luck evolution beyond basic probability enhancement through proper training

**Blue Magic Interactions** (Chapter 21, 26):
- **Foretelling-Luck Interference**: "Exponentially increasing divergence" creates complications when abilities interact
- **Blue Magic Detection**: Blue mages can "reliably detect and break Luck effects with minimal magic expenditure"
- **Tactical Vulnerability**: Luck users must watch for Blue magic practitioners who can neutralize probability advantages

### Combat Effectiveness & Limitations

**Battlefield Applications**:
- **Chapter 27**: Green mage selection often incorporates Luck-based decision making as valid tactical consideration
- **Training Programs** (Chapter 26): Extensive magical experimentation attempts to enhance Luck effectiveness for military advantage
- **Limited Progress**: "Difference in martial outcomes does not appear to be worth speaking of" suggests practical limitations

**Tactical Considerations**:
- **Mindset Dependency**: Effectiveness appears connected to user's comfort with fate-acceptance and probability-based strategies
- **Cultural Advantage**: Green mages naturally suited for Luck applications through philosophical alignment
- **Resource Efficiency**: Relatively low magical cost makes repeated applications feasible during extended encounters

## Description

**MP Cost**: 10 MP per application (minor but nontrivial fixed cost)  
**Time Cost**: One second per application  
**Duration**: One hour maximum, or until consumed by preventing unfavorable outcome  

**Effect**: The target tends to have more "luck," in that particularly bad things happen less often to them, and more often to anyone trying to do them harm. This effect isn't predictable and dissipates in about an hour, or as soon as one tries to rely on it.

**Enhanced Mechanics**: While active, allows the target of the ability to **redo any unfavorable resolution as if it never happened**. The effect is consumed upon use, requiring reapplication for continued protection.

## QM Data

**MP Cost**: 10 MP per application  
**Time Cost**: One second per application  
**Application Duration**: One hour maximum  

**Description**: The target tends to have more "luck," in that particularly bad things happen less often. This effect isn't predictable and dissipates in about an hour, or until the application is consumed.

**QM Notes**: While active, allows the target of the ability to redo any unfavorable resolution as if it never happened. The effect is consumed upon use.
