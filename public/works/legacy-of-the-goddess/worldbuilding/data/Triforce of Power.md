## Story Integration

The Triforce of Power serves as the central source of Ganondorf's authority and strength throughout the Legacy of the Goddess saga, representing the divine embodiment of Din's power and the primary opposing force to the Triforce of Wisdom and Courage.

### Central Narrative Role
The Triforce of Power drives the primary antagonistic force of the story, with its fragments distributed among Ganondorf and his key lieutenants. This distribution creates a network of empowered enemies that poses escalating threats throughout the narrative, while the complete piece represents the ultimate source of tyrannical authority.

### Fragment Distribution & Holders
**Ganondorf's Personal Holdings**:
- **Fragment 1**: Won through defeating Morudo Geira's avatar with Demise's assistance
- **Fragment 2**: Held within the legendary Sword of Kings, claimed by right of conquest as Gerudo High King

**Mokoblin Lieutenant Network**:
- **Big Bis**: First to be subdued by Ganondorf, wears fragment on simple necklace, commands Marauder's Lake forces
- **Kurruk the Red**: Defeated and forced into submission, wears fragment on ring, commands largest Blin tribe
- **Boss Snurl**: Inherited fragment after his superior's death, wears as earring, spearheaded Talus assault

**Royal Connection**:
- **King Hyrule**: Holds fragment representing legitimate royal authority, currently incapacitated by mysterious illness

### Power Manifestations & Story Impact
**Military Applications**:
- Each fragment provides exponential strength enhancement (1.1^x multiplier) enabling superhuman combat capability
- Grants additional stress points (3 per shard) allowing sustained combat operations
- Progressive transformation abilities at higher fragment counts create shapeshifting capabilities

**Strategic Advantages**:
- Temporal stasis abilities provide tactical control over battlefield conditions and enemy movement
- Enhanced magical power enables large-scale operations and supernatural influence
- Authority enhancement makes fragment holders natural leaders and commanders

**Cosmic Significance**:
- Complete Triforce grants deific avatar transformation reflecting wielder's personality
- Represents Din's power as balance to Wisdom (Nayru) and Courage (Farore)
- Ultimate assembly would grant near-limitless physical and magical capabilities

### Story Appearances & Chapter Integration
- **Ancient History**: Ganondorf's conquest campaign to collect fragments establishes his power base
- **Current Conflict**: Mokoblin commanders using fragments drive the Blin invasion threatening Hyrule
- **Political Implications**: King's fragment represents legitimate authority, its loss would destabilize the kingdom
- **Cosmic Threat**: References to "Old-God" bargains and blood moon magic suggest corruption of Power fragments
- **Strategic Balance**: Fragment distribution creates multiple super-powered enemies requiring coordinated response

### Character Development Impact
**Ganondorf's Authority**: Fragment possession legitimizes his claim to leadership while providing practical power to enforce his will
**Enemy Hierarchy**: Fragment-bearing Mokoblins become elite commanders, elevating simple tribal conflicts to cosmic significance
**Royal Crisis**: King's incapacitation while holding fragment creates succession and security vulnerabilities

## Description

The Triforce of Power represents one-third of the complete Triforce, embodying Din's divine authority and the concept of strength through legitimate leadership. When whole, it grants the wielder a deific avatar reflecting their personality with near-limitless physical and magical capabilities. When fragmented, it distributes exponential enhancements to strength, magic, and endurance among multiple bearers.

Unlike mere tools of destruction, the Triforce of Power requires wielders who genuinely believe themselves worthy to lead out of necessity rather than personal ambition. This restriction ensures that only those willing to take complete responsibility for their actions and the consequences can truly harness its abilities, making it a divine test of character as much as a source of enhancement.

## QM Data
### Abilities:
When whole, the Triforce of Power grants the wielder the ability to take on a Deific avatar corresponding to the wielder’s personality. While transformed, the wielder’s physical power and endurance are nearly limitless, and their magical power is magnified tremendously.

When fragmented, grants immense physical and magical power, depending on the number of shards possessed:
* Strength and Magic Cap is multiplied by 1.1^x
* Maximum Stress points is increased by 3 per shard.

Also grants transformation abilities:
* At 3 shards, grants the ability to partially transform body and limbs
* At 6 shards, grants the ability to shapeshift into other forms

Wielders may also, with a constant expenditure of Magic Power, lock a person or location in temporal stasis.
* A locked person can expend MP to prevent the stasis. The cost for the wielder to impose the effect is (10-X) times the MP expended by the person attempting to escape. Locking a person requires uninterrupted physical or magical contact for twelve seconds. Cost to maintain is (1000 - 100x)MP per hour.
* For locations, the MP cost to maintain the effect is (10-X) times the volume of space enclosed, in m^3. Locking a location requires uninterrupted meditation for a number of seconds equal to the volume of the space enclosed in m^3. If multiple people are locked in stasis within a location, the cost for locking each person is added to the total. Cost to maintain is (1000 - 100x)MP per hour.

### Restrictions:
**Explicit**: Can only be used by an individual who truly believes themselves worthy to lead; not by "right", nor for personal gain, nor because they desire power for power's sake. Rather, because "it must be done and no one else will." Cf. - Heroic Responsibility, Nihil Supernum.

**Implicit**:
* The wielder need not be "good" in any traditional sense; they must only be willing to take personal responsibility for all things, and seek to correct any perceived flaws in the world at all costs. 
* Wielder must also be "incorruptible"; motivations cannot be changed by additional power. Anyone who would use the increased power to maintain their own power, or whose goals and ambitions would be changed by the increased power cannot ultimately satisfy the explicit requirement.
