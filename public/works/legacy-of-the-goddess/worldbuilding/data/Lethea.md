## Story Integration

### Historical Context & Power Decline
**Pre-Invasion Significance**: Lethea represents the class of **beneficial Fae entities** who historically provided aid to worthy heroes, demonstrating that not all Fae were malevolent manipulators like **[[Cyrae]]**. Her practice of **"blessing heroic travelers"** suggests she operated within a transactional but beneficial framework, contrasting with more parasitic Fae approaches.

**Blin Invasion Impact**: The **thousand-year timeline** since the **[[Blin]]** invasion aligns precisely with the major historical catastrophe that **"overwhelmed the Kingdom of [[Farwatch]]"** and forced massive population relocations. Lethea's power decline coincides with this period when **"[[Hylia]] was nowhere to be found"** and **"the powers of her [[Lightsworn]] long since faded."**

### Geographic & Sacred Positioning
**Forgotten Temple Proximity**: Her location **"on an islet just east of the [[Forgotten Temple]]"** places her near the **[[The Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess]]**, where an **[[Ancient Hero]]** made his final stand and a **[[Triforce of Courage]]** fragment was lost. This sacred geography suggests potential connection to heroic blessing traditions.

**Strategic Isolation**: The islet location provides natural containment while remaining accessible to worthy travelers, representing a middle ground between Fae entities like **[[Cyrae]]** (bound to prevent harm) and **[[Lucia]]** (actively beneficial but constrained).

### Canonical Fae Integration
**Fae Ecosystem Position**: Within the broader Fae network documented in the story, Lethea represents the **"distant/contained"** category of entities with **"marginal current influence"** but historical significance. Her power loss pattern matches other Fae entities whose influence waned after the cosmic disruptions that followed **[[Hylia's Demise]]**.

**Order of Sages Awareness**: While not actively pursued by **[[Seekers]]** due to her reduced threat level, Lethea's existence would be known to the **[[Order of Sages]]** as part of their **systematic Fae suppression operations**. Her beneficial nature and weakened state likely place her in low-priority monitoring status.

## Description
### About
Resides on an islet just east of the [[Forgotten Temple]]. Once a powerful [[Fae]] who was said to bless heroic travelers -- if they were willing to accept her price. She has not had any real measure of influence since the [[Blin]] invasion a thousand years ago, and her power has waned significantly.
