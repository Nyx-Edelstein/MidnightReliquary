## Description
**Historical Context**: The Sovereignty represents the height of Hylian civilization under Hylia's direct protection, existing approximately 3232 AC when Hylian society reached unprecedented technological and magical advancement before its destruction during the Great Calamity.

**Cross-Reference**: See [[The Hylian Sovereignty]] for additional details.

## Story Integration
**Canonical Context**: The Sovereignty serves as the lost golden age that all current Hylian kingdoms aspire to restore. Its destruction by Majora's forces (orchestrated by Odium) represents the archetypal fall from grace that shaped Hylian cultural memory and political ambitions.

**Timeline Framework**: As referenced in the comprehensive worldbuilding timeline, The Sovereignty flourished for over 1700 years (3232-4962 AC) before its catastrophic destruction, establishing the theological and political foundation for all subsequent Hylian civilizations.

**Cultural Legacy**: The Sovereignty's advanced "magic and technology" represents the pinnacle of what divine-mortal cooperation can achieve, serving as both inspiration and cautionary tale about the fragility of cosmic protection.

## Canonical Reconciliation
**Divine Protection Era**: The Sovereignty existed during the period of Hylia's active stewardship, explaining its extraordinary achievements in both magical and technological advancementâ€”capabilities that current Hyrule has largely lost.

**Destruction Pattern**: Its fall to Majora's assault establishes the pattern of cosmic threats overwhelming divine protection that culminates in Hylia's own destruction by Demise and the current crisis facing Zelda's kingdom.
