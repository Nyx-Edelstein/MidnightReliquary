## Description
**MP Cost**:
1000 + 12.5% of total Experience of individual being to be marked

**Time Cost**:
Instant (first)

For subsequent markings, one full day for the mark to take effect

**Description**:
Gain access to the viewpoint of a willing target individual, and drastically reduce the cost for telepathic communication with them so long as the mark is active.

Any number of individuals can be marked, but only three marks can be "active" at a given time. Activating/deactivating marks has a negligible cost, but takes a full day for the effect to complete.

**QM Notes**:
This ability allows players to accrue additional power:

Power is accrued at a rate of 10x the experience gained from active marked individuals, plus 1x the experience gained from inactive marked individuals. (Individuals typically earn 1 exp per day, but can earn many multiples of that if exceptionally heroic.)

## Story Integration
**Canonical Context**: This ability represents an extremely advanced form of divine magic that creates soul-level connections between beings. The high MP cost and experience-based scaling suggests this is a divine or legendary-tier ability, potentially linked to the Triforce or similar divine artifacts.

**Narrative Significance**: The Mark of Transference serves as a powerful tool for building networks of allies and monitoring distant events. The limitation to three active marks creates strategic depth, requiring careful selection of key individuals for monitoring.

## Canonical Reconciliation
**Lore Consistency**: The experience-based cost scaling aligns with the concept that more powerful individuals require greater magical investment to mark. The willing target requirement maintains ethical boundaries while the viewpoint access provides strategic advantages.

**Power Balance**: The 1000 MP base cost plus percentage scaling ensures this remains a high-level ability, while the daily activation time prevents rapid tactical switching of marks.
