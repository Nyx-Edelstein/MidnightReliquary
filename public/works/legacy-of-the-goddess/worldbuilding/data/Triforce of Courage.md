## Story Integration

### Central Narrative Role
The Triforce of Courage serves as Link's primary supernatural empowerment throughout Legacy of the Goddess, providing the death-reversal capabilities and preternatural awareness that enable him to survive cosmic-level threats and protect others. As the divine embodiment of [[Farore]]'s power, it represents protective courage, selfless sacrifice, and the supernatural resilience needed to face overwhelming odds while maintaining moral integrity.

### Fragment Progression & Link's Development
**Story-Confirmed Abilities**: Link's possession of at least one Courage fragment is revealed in Chapter 3, where he shows Zelda the **"jagged fragment of gold"** in his necklace that was **"given to him by his uncle"** and **"passed down by the men of his family, said to grant luck and good fortune."** This family heirloom represents generational heroic legacy and Farore's ongoing selection of worthy champions.

**Preternatural Enhancement**: The fragments provide Link with **"preternatural reflexes and instincts that border on premonition,"** enabling him to anticipate attacks, navigate dangerous situations, and make split-second decisions that preserve life. This supernatural awareness proves crucial during combat encounters and crisis response situations.

**Death-Reversal Mechanism**: The worldbuilding framework indicates that courage fragments enable **"reverting a death by up to X seconds before the event by sacrificing an action for the next day,"** though the specific story implementation of this ability requires correlation with Link's demonstrated survivability throughout dangerous encounters.

### Divine Restrictions & Character Development
**Moral Requirements**: The Triforce of Courage **"can only be used by an individual simultaneously capable of selfless sacrifice and the utter rejection of all evil"** while requiring the wielder to **"always be decisive, unflinching in the face of danger, and must never hesitate to act."** These restrictions shape Link's character development and explain his consistent moral choices throughout the story.

**Sacrifice Willingness**: The requirement to be **"willing to endure pain and suffering if necessary, and even possibly experience their own death in 'shadow' actions"** reflects the courage needed to face cosmic threats. Link's repeated willingness to risk his life for others demonstrates his compatibility with these divine requirements.

**Heroic Decisiveness**: The mandate to **"never hesitate to act"** explains Link's characteristic immediate response to crisis situations and his natural leadership during emergency circumstances. This supernatural enhancement enables tactical coordination and split-second decision-making under pressure.

### Farore's Divine Empowerment
**Goddess Selection**: Link's recognition as **"Farore's chosen"** and his bonding with a Courage fragment represents divine selection based on his embodiment of protective courage and life-preserving values. His empathetic connections, willingness to sacrifice for others, and rejection of destructive power align with Farore's creation principles.

**Cross-Species Communication**: Link's unique ability to communicate with and gain trust from various creatures likely stems from Farore's biological attunement gifts enhanced through the Courage fragment. This enables diplomatic solutions and alliance-building across species barriers.

### Timeline Manipulation & Reality Warping
**Advanced Capabilities**: At higher fragment levels, the Triforce of Courage enables **"experiencing up to four possible unfoldings of events, choosing which timeline becomes 'real'"** and **"splitting oneself into four individual bodies."** These reality-manipulation abilities represent cosmic-level power suitable for confronting threats like Demise.

**Strategic Applications**: The ability to **"see"** actions before performing them (up to 30 seconds with full fragment collection) provides tactical advantages crucial for protecting others and making optimal decisions during high-stakes encounters.

**Power Conservation**: The restriction that **"recharge time for this ability is exactly equal to however much time is used to 'see ahead'"** prevents overuse while ensuring the power serves protective rather than exploitative purposes.

### Story Locations & Fragment Distribution
**Fragment Locations**: The worldbuilding indicates fragments are distributed across various locations including **[[Gulf of Nayru]]**, **[[Lost Woods]]** (held by Great Fae **[[Genazede]]**), **[[Faron Woods]]** (attached to **[[Courage Wolf]]**), and others. Link's family necklace represents one fragment with potential for additional collection throughout the story.

**Link's Heritage**: The fragment being **"passed down by the men of his family"** suggests generational heroic legacy and Farore's ongoing selection of worthy champions within Link's bloodline. This family tradition establishes Link's heroic potential as both earned and inherited.

## QM Data
### Abilities:
When whole, the Triforce of Courage grants power to defy reality itself. The wielder is granted:
* The ability to experience up to four possible unfoldings of events, choosing which timeline becomes “real” and which fade into non existence, as if they never happened. The duration of these “splits” are limited to one minute.
* (Mutually exclusive with the above while active) The ability to split oneself into four individual bodies for up to one minute. Each body is physically real and can interact with the world; however, all but one will fade away either when the effect ends or when dismissed by the wielder. The wielder determines which body to inhabit at the end of the effect, and is aware of the experiences of all four bodies.
* The user may sacrifice one split for one day to revert time by one hour. This ability may be used immediately upon death.
* Dramatically boosted physical and magical recovery

When fragmented, grants lesser effects, which the wielder experiences as preternatural reflexes and instincts that border on premonition:
1. Allows the user to instantly and intuitively "see" an action they could perform before doing it, up to 5 seconds after the action. The recharge time for this ability is exactly equal to however much time is used to "see ahead".
2. Increases to 10 seconds.
3. Increases to 15 seconds.
4. Grants an additional action. The user may also revert a death by up to X seconds before the event by sacrificing an action for the next day.
5. Increases to 20 seconds.
6. Increases to 25 seconds.
7. Increases to 30 seconds.
8. Grants a third action. The user may also revert time by up to 30 seconds by sacrificing an action for the next day.

Additionally, each fragment multiplies reflex and versatility by 1.1^x

### Restrictions:
**Explicit**: Can only be used by an individual simultaneously capable of selfless sacrifice and the utter rejection of all evil. The wielder must always be decisive, unflinching in the face of danger, and must never hesitate to act. Cf. "Heading the Phoenix's call" or "Casting a Patronus".

**Implicit**: The Wielder must be willing to endure pain and suffering if necessary, and even possibly experience their own death in "shadow" actions; otherwise the granted abilities will not be of much use.
