## Story Integration
### Narrative Role
Blin serve as a fundamental worldbuilding element representing the eastern territorial threat that shaped Hyrule's history and continues to influence current events. Their historical conquest of Farwatch and occupation of the Plains of Ruin establishes the geopolitical backdrop for territorial conflicts and resource scarcity that drive multiple story threads.

### Chapter Appearances & Context
- **Historical Foundation**: The thousand-year-old Blin invasion that destroyed Farwatch and forced the abandonment of Byrna provides crucial historical context for understanding current territorial boundaries and the significance of the Plains of Ruin
- **Ganondorf Alliance**: Several Mokoblin leaders (Kurruk the Red, Big Bis, Boss Snurl) carry Triforce of Power shards and serve as Ganondorf's military commanders, directly connecting Blin forces to the primary antagonist's power structure
- **Talus Pass Defense**: The ongoing containment of Blin forces at Talus Pass represents active military obligations that constrain Hyrulean strategic options and resource allocation
- **Triforce Distribution**: The presence of both Triforce of Power shards (with Ganondorf-allied Mokoblins) and Triforce of Wisdom influences (with Ildram the Sage's monastery at Farwatch ruins) demonstrates the complex magical-political dynamics affecting Blin society

### Cross-Reference Connections
- **Geographical Impact**: Occupation of Plains of Ruin, Akkala, and eastern coastlands directly affects travel routes, trade patterns, and military positioning referenced throughout the story
- **Historical Precedent**: The cycle of Mokoblin warlords rising every century provides a predictable threat pattern that influences long-term planning and defensive strategies
- **Military Dynamics**: The numerical superiority (3-4 million total population) requiring containment rather than reconquest reflects realistic military limitations that constrain strategic options
- **Magical Integration**: Blin use of red magic and their interaction with Triforce shards demonstrates their integration into the broader magical ecosystem rather than serving as purely mundane antagonists

### Canon Reconciliation
No conflicts detected between story canon and worldbuilding data. The Blin's role as eastern territorial occupants, their alliance with Ganondorf through Triforce-bearing Mokoblins, and their historical impact on Hyrulean geography aligns with established narrative frameworks. The presence of both aggressive warlord factions and peaceful monastery elements (Ildram the Sage) provides narrative flexibility for various story developments.

## Description
### Overview
Blin are simple-minded, tribalistic raiders. They look vaguely like something between a pig and a primate. Their skin is rough and leathery, and varies in color, with the most common being earth shades and mud-tones. They have thick, almost claw-like nails. They often, but not always, have several large protruding teeth, and some even grow tusks and horns. They can take many sizes and shapes, from small and lanky to truly gargantuan. Size and girth seems to be a direct indicator of strength and status to the Blin, as larger and stronger Blin will invariably command groups of whatever size they can keep under control.

They have been observed to eat almost anything (or anyone). Normally they form groups of less than a dozen, but occasionally they are brought together into larger bands for raiding, with the size of the group being roughly proportional to the strength of its leader.

Blin are ubiquitously known to be capable fighters, archers, and horse riders. Use of crude iron and steel tools among them are uncommon, but not scarce. [[Magic]] usage is also prevalent, though somewhat uncommon, with [[red magic]] being by far the most frequent. 

Once every few hundred years or so, an exceptionally powerful and intelligent leader (well, for a Blin at least) rises to power. These Warlords invariably gather together massive warbands to scour the countryside. This has been an ever-present threat for the kingdom over the years, and has been the primary influence of policy and organization.

Not much is known about Blin culture, insofar as they have any. There are four descriptors Blin use to identify those of the various statuses, which is usually readily apparent by physical size and demeanor:

**Bokoblin** - "Weak person"

**Bulblin** - "Average person"

**Moblin** - "Strong person"

**Mokoblin** - "Mighty person" (i.e. - Warlords)

### History
According to a play by [[Seff]] (based loosely on folklore and legend), many years ago Blin hordes numbering in the hundreds of thousands invaded the eastern coastlands and overwhelmed the Kingdom of [[Farwatch]]. Countless were killed, priceless artifacts were lost, and ancient tomes of knowledge were burned as the city was razed. Those that could, fled to [[Byrna]], including the reigning monarch and his family.

Initially the goddesses did nothing to help the people. Amidst a growing panic, The Elder Council of Byrna and the Twelve Sages convened, together with the King of Farwatch and his advisers, spending three days locked away in silence. When they emerged, they claimed to have received direction from [[Hylia]] to flee to the west. Hylia anointed a champion, who rallied knights to fend off the Blin while the people retreated inland. They were successful, but at high cost, with many dying (the Champion included).

The eastern coastlands are referred to in modern times as the [[Plains of Ruin]]. To this day, the Blin still hold the lands east of [[Talus]]. Their sheer numbers have proven too much for the Hylians to best, despite numerous attempts over the years to retake their homeland by Kings and Generals blinded by promises of glory. 

### Lore
No one knows exactly where the Blin originate, except that it is from areas far to the east, across [[Farore's Sea]].

Likewise, not much is known of their culture.

The Blin are not particularly intelligent, and are not known for their technological prowess.

## QM Data
### Overview
Blin are simple-minded, tribalistic raiders. It is deeply ingrained in their psychology that might makes right, and little matters in the world to them besides food, fun, and spoils. Naturally, they take great pleasure in gathering around bonfires each night and telling stories of their exploits over a fresh kill (followed by much debauchery). While they can be communicated with, they are immensely distrustful of outsiders, and more often than not will attack or flee upon encountering anyone or anything they are not familiar with.

Blin look vaguely like something between a pig and a primate (and bear a striking resemblance to [[Grubber]]s). Their skin is rough and leathery, and varies in color, with the most common being earth shades and mud-tones. They have thick, almost claw-like nails. They often, but not always, have several large protruding teeth, and some even grow tusks and horns. They can take many sizes and shapes, from small and lanky to truly gargantuan. Size and girth is a direct indicator of strength and status to the Blin, as larger and stronger Blin will invariably command groups of whatever size they can keep under control (and thus will often take the [[Lynel]]'s share of any food and spoils...)

They are entirely carnivorous and will eat almost anything (or anyone), but usually subsist off of fishing, cultivating insects, herding livestock, and hunting small game. Normally they form groups of less than a dozen, but occasionally they are brought together into larger bands for raiding, with the size of the group being roughly proportional to the strength of its leader. Blin raid other tribes often, but only raid other races as a last resort when resources are particularly scarce, as it usually results in unacceptably high death tolls (albeit on both sides).

Blin are ubiquitously known to be capable fighters, archers, and horse riders. And while their craftsmanship leaves much to be desired, occasionally a Blin will survive long enough to learn or discover basic metallurgy and smithing. Iron and steel tools are uncommon, but not scarce.

Once per century or so, there will be born a Blin with exceptional intelligence -- well, for a Blin at least. If they manage to survive and rise to power, these Warlords invariably gather together massive warbands to scour the countryside and lay waste to any and all who are unprepared.

Blin culture, insofar as they have one, is roughly organized as a caste system. This is not due to any cultural notions of inheritance or rank, but instead due simply to the fact that more powerful Blin will tend ensure their offspring are well-fed, and thus grow to be healthier and stronger themselves. There are four descriptors Blin use to identify those of the various statuses, which is usually readily apparent by physical size and demeanor:

**Bokoblin** - "Weak person"

**Bulblin** - "Average person"

**Moblin** - "Strong person"

**Mokoblin** - "Mighty person"

### History
Just over one thousand years ago, Blin hordes numbering in the hundreds of thousands invaded the eastern coastlands. Their might and sheer numbers quickly overwhelmed the guard and minimal defenses garrisoned at [[Farwatch]], making short work of the ancient city and most of its inhabitants. Millions were killed, priceless artifacts were lost, and ancient tomes of knowledge were burned as the city was razed. Those that could, fled to [[Byrna]], including the reigning monarch and his family.

The people were horrified, stunned, and appalled by the slaughter at Farwatch. Many felt betrayed. Despite constant prayers and offerings to their goddess, [[Hylia]] was nowhere to be found. Why had she allowed this to happen? She had not given forewarning, had not protected her people from the savages, had not even empowered one of her [[Lightsworn]] to lead the defense in her stead. Had they been forsaken?

As the Blin hordes turned on Byrna, tensions rose. Should they fight? Try to hold out against the coming siege? Flee? Amidst a growing panic, The Elder Council of Byrna and the Twelve [[Sages]] convened, together with the King of Farwatch and his advisers, spending three days locked away in silence.

When at last they emerged, it was revealed that Hylia had given them direction; that the people of Byrna and the survivors of Farwatch would flee and seek refuge in Hyrule, and that Hylia would anoint a champion to lead the counterassault soon thereafter. 

When the Blin arrived at Byrna, they met with a city largely evacuated. After overrunning the minimal resistance that had decided to stay and defend, the Blin Warlord known as [[Skeiddgos the Mighty]] decided to make his home in the abandoned city, sending out most of the horde to pillage and raid the countryside. However, every night, hundreds to thousands of Blin would go missing, apparently slain by ghosts. After several days of sustained losses, Skeiddgos and his Lieutenants were killed as well. Without a mighty leader to hold the hordes together, and not knowing where these strikes came from, the Blin gave up on Byrna as cursed. They fled, scattering across the land, which would come to be known as the [[Plains of Ruin]].

Even as Farwatch fell and Byrna was abandoned, the northern lands of [[Akkala]] were still held for nearly three hundred years before the next Warlord came along and amassed a warband large enough to overwhelm the defenders. Most retreated to [[Talus]], although one particularly courageous hero (wielding the [[Triforce of Courage]] nonetheless) diverted the advancing Blin forces towards a redoubt at [[The Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess]], making a last stand at the secluded temple and buying time for his allies to retreat. Though vastly outnumbered, he and his brethren successfully halted the attack -- though at high cost, with the hero himself dying shortly after due to wounds sustained in battle, and the temple itself being lost.

### Location Lore
No one knows exactly where the Blin originate, except that it is from areas far to the east, across [[Farore's Sea]]. The Blin are not particularly intelligent, and are not known for their technological prowess. Still, over the course of several generations, they were guided by unseen forces to gradually improve on their seafaring knowledge, building ever better vessels and ships, until one day [[Skeiddgos the Mighty]] rose to power and decided to lead his horde across the sea and into lands unknown.

To this day, the Blin still hold the lands east of Talus. Their sheer numbers have proven too much for the Hylians to best, despite numerous attempts to retake their homeland by Kings and Generals blinded by promises of glory. Still, Hylian forces have been mostly successful in containing the Blin at a natural choke-point dubbed the Talus Pass. There, they patrol in force, systematically crushing any Blin raiding parties who venture too far inland.

There are currently about 1 million Blin scattered across [[Akkala]] and the [[Plains of Ruin]], who live as nomadic hunters and livestock farmers. There are many more Blin along the eastern coast that subsist off of primarily fishing, fluctuating between 2 to 3 million.

### Important Characters
As the Blin do not record their history (except as told over bonfire feasts), precious little information about their heritage has survived to the present day. Still, all know the name of [[Skeiddgos the Mighty]], the Warlord who conquered the [[Hylian]]s, and Blin will often curse or boast in his name.

Other Blin of note alive in the present day include three Mokoblins who carry shards of the [[Triforce of Power]]. These Blin have been defeated or subdued by [[Ganondorf]], and are now at the forefront of his armies.
* [[Kurruk the Red]], who controls the largest tribe on the southern plains
* [[Big Bis]], the boss of [[Marauder's Lake]]
* [[Boss Snurl]], leader of the largest tribe in [[Akkala]]

Additionally, some Blin who happened upon a shard of the [[Triforce of Wisdom]] buried in the ruins of [[Farwatch]] have founded a monastery there, secluding themselves from the rest of the world and seeking peace and enlightenment. They are lead by one calling himself [[Ildram the Sage]].
