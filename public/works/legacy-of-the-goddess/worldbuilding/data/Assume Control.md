## Story Integration
**Canonical Function**: **High-level void magic** enabling **direct puppet control** of willing subjects, with **cost reduction** through [[Mark of Transference]] preparation. Represents **advanced magical mastery** beyond typical spellcaster capabilities.

**Strategic Applications**: Essential for **coordinated operations** requiring **simultaneous multi-body control**, **remote exploration** of dangerous areas, or **skill transfer** from experienced to novice operators.

**Ethical Constraints**: **Willing subject requirement** prevents **forced possession**, though **psychological coercion** could circumvent this limitation. **MP cost scaling** prevents **extended use** without significant magical reserves.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
200 × Hours controlling (marked)

10% Experience of character × Hours controlling (unmarked)

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Assume direct control of a willing individual. Cost is reduced if that individual has been marked with [[Mark of Transference]].

**Cost Analysis**: **Unmarked control** becomes **prohibitively expensive** for high-level characters, scaling with **total experience investment**. **Marked targets** enable **extended operations** at **fixed costs**.

**Control Mechanics**: **Complete sensory takeover** with **original consciousness suppressed** but **retained**. **Memory continuity** allows **skill access** and **knowledge utilization** from both controller and subject.

**Tactical Limitations**: **Single-target focus** prevents **multiple simultaneous possessions**. **Distance constraints** may apply based on **magical link strength** and **environmental interference**.
