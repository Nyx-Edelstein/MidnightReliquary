The northernmost Mokoblin of the [[Blin]] refused [[Ganondorf]]'s demand to join his growing horde. As a result, he was slain in single combat by [[Kurruk the Red]] at the behest of Ganondorf.

His second-in-command,[Boss Snurl, was granted the spoils of his superior, along with command of his tribes. This Mokoblin spearheaded the assault on Talus outpost and is at the forefront of the invasion into [[Castletown]]. He wears a shard of the [[Triforce of Power]] as an earring.
