## Story Integration

### Guardian Beast Role & Historical Failure
**Rito Protection Failure**: Eldin's tragic failure to protect the **[[Rito]]** people represents a critical breakdown in the guardian system, demonstrating that even powerful entities can be deceived by malicious forces and that protective dedication doesn't guarantee success.

**Geographic Isolation Response**: Following the Rito massacre, Eldin's complete isolation of the **[[Eye of Din]]** perpendicularity shows how traumatic failure can transform protective instincts into absolute exclusion, preventing both threats and legitimate visitors from accessing crucial locations.

### Strategic Intelligence Value
**Triforce Fragment Knowledge**: Eldin's memory of the **[[Triforce of Courage]]** being split makes him an invaluable intelligence source, as he "knows the general locations of each of the shards"—information crucial to the kingdom's defense against cosmic threats.

**Recent Slumber**: His "fitful slumber" creates both opportunity and risk—while he might be approachable during unconsciousness, awakening him requires overcoming his defensive instincts and convincing him not to destroy potential allies.

### Cross-References
- **[[Eye of Din]]**: Location he guards and protects from all intrusion
- **[[Rito]]**: The people he failed to protect, now reduced to legend
- **[[Triforce of Courage]]**: Crucial intelligence he possesses about fragment locations
- **[[Guardian Beast]]**: Classification and role within the protective entity system
- **[[Perpendicularity]]**: The cosmic phenomenon he guards at the Eye of Din

## Description
### About
An ancient [[guardian beast]] who defends a [[perpendicularity]] centered at the [[Eye of Din]]. He once took it upon himself to defend the [[Rito]] people in the absence of [[Hylia]] to protect them, but failed to do so when a malicious entity slipped past his guard and ruthlessly slaughtered his charges just to spite him. Since then, knowledge of the Rito have waned into legend and myth. Now, no traveler or beast enters the Eye of Din without his approval, and he never approves.

Very recently has fallen into a fitful slumber.

## QM Data
### Potential Plot Hooks
Eldin also remembers when the [[Triforce of Courage]] was last split, and was flying above his roost at the time. As such, he knows the general locations of each of the shards. If he can be awakened (and convinced to not destroy those come to call), he may be an essential source of information.
