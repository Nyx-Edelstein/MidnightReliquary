Provides crucial intelligence about **internal Blin conflicts** and **leadership dynamics**, demonstrating sophisticated understanding of both magical communication and strategic intelligence sharing.

### Character Arc and Significance
**Triforce of Wisdom Bearer & Dream Communication**: Ildram's possession of a **Triforce of Wisdom fragment** enables **magical communication through shared dreams across great distances** with Zelda, another Wisdom fragment bearer.

**Blin Society Intelligence & Schism Warning**: Demonstrates deep understanding of **schism within Blin society**, warning about specific factional conflicts between **enlightenment-seeking Blin** and **Mokoblin leadership forcing compliance** with destructive magical development. His intelligence about **Power-based enhancements given to Warlords** and **blood magic derived from corrupted "Fish-God" teachings** (likely Ja'bu's influence) provides crucial strategic information.

**Monastery Leadership & Peace Mission**: Established a **monastery for peace and enlightenment** in Farwatch ruins where **intelligent or forward-thinking Blin** seek wisdom and spiritual development.

## Description
Ildram the Sage represents a **Blin enlightenment leader bearing Triforce of Wisdom fragments** who established a monastery for peace and spiritual development in the ruins of Farwatch. His **magical communication abilities** and **deep understanding of Blin society schisms** make him a crucial intelligence asset and potential diplomatic bridge for preventing unnecessary warfare while both sides face the cosmic threat from Demise.

**Enhanced Context**: As a **Triforce of Wisdom fragment bearer**, Ildram demonstrates that **wisdom transcends species barriers** and can create unexpected alliances. His **forced knowledge of blood magic** and **growing resistance to Mokoblin coercion** positions him as both intelligence source and potential ally against the greater supernatural threat.

## QM Data
Happening upon an ancient relic in the ruins of [[Farwatch]], a more-intelligent-than-average [[Blin]] understood vaguely what treasure he had found. Influenced by the power of a shard of the [[Triforce of Wisdom]] in the relic, this "Sage" gathered together those Blin that would listen to his teachings, and raised a monastery where he and his followers have secluded themselves from the rest of the world while seeking peace and enlightenment
