## Story Integration

### Fundamental Cosmic Law Applications
**Fae Sustenance System**: Sacrifice represents the **primary mechanism** by which **[[Fae]]** entities derive **power and sustenance** from **mortal interactions**. **Chapter 32** confirms that **Fae require Void Power** to survive, and **Chapter 14** establishes that **"Some void entities require something like residual life energies to sustain themselves. They require sacrifice to survive."**

**Entity Bargain Framework**: The **"rules older than any of those that govern mortal worlds"** establishes **cosmic-level authority** that **supersedes local magical systems**. **Lucia's binding pact** with **[[Morudo Geira]]** represents **major Sacrifice application** where she **"traded her freedom"** for **geographic limitation** of Geira's influence.

**Value Substitution Mechanics**: The **"approximate value"** specification enables **strategic exchanges** where **entities substitute equivalent power** for **mortal offerings**. This explains **The Reaffirmation** where **Lucia sacrificed herself** to Geira in exchange for **binding promise** to **not directly interfere** outside Gerudo lands.

### Story-Confirmed Applications
**Void Entity Survival Requirements**: **[[Demise]]**, **[[Ja'bu]]**, and **[[Morudo Geira]]** demonstrate **entity types** that **"require sacrifice to survive"** as **fundamental aspect** of their **existence**. This creates **ongoing pressure** for **entity-mortal conflict** where **entities seek sacrificial offerings** for **continued existence**.

**Shesan's Intelligence Operations**: **Chapter 14** reveals **void entity knowledge** about **"what counts as sacrifice"** remains **uncertain even to experienced operators**: **"I do not know. It may be that the world itself is the sole arbiter of what counts and what doesn't."** This **cosmic arbitration** suggests **objective cosmic law** rather than **subjective interpretation**.

**Fae Corruption Connection**: The **sacrifice-corruption relationship** appears through **Lucia's restraint philosophy** where **using Fae powers** for **mortal manipulation** represents **corrupting sacrifice** that **"tends to lose pieces of ourselves"** and **transforms divine fragments** into **malevolent entities**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Cosmic Authority Hierarchy**: Sacrifice operates under **"rules older than any of those that govern mortal worlds,"** placing it **above Triforce mechanics**, **chromatic magic**, and **standard magical systems**. This **universal authority** explains why **entities across realms** can **invoke binding exchanges** that **transcend local magical limitations**.

**Permanent Exchange Requirements**: The **"permanently sacrifices"** specification distinguishes **true Sacrifice** from **temporary exchanges** or **magical costs**. This **permanence requirement** creates **high stakes** for **entity interactions** while preventing **trivial exploitation** of **cosmic exchange mechanisms**.

**Entity Value Assessment**: The **"Entity may substitute something of approximate value"** creates **entity discretion** in **determining equivalence**, potentially enabling **strategic manipulation** where **entities assess value differently** than **mortal expectations**. This **asymmetric valuation** adds **negotiation complexity** to **entity interactions**.

**Void Power Integration**: Sacrifice serves as **primary mechanism** for **Void Power transfer** from **mortal realm** to **entity sustenance**, creating **fundamental energy flow** that **maintains entity existence** while **depleting mortal world resources**.

**Description**:
Through rules older than any of those that govern mortal worlds, when a Being permanently sacrifices something of value to the Entity, that Entity may substitute something of approximate value in its place.
