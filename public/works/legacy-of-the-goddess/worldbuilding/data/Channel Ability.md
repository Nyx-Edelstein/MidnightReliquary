## Story Integration

### Entity Interaction Framework
**Void Between Worlds Limitation**: Channel Ability addresses the fundamental **restriction** that **entities** like **[[Fi]]** face when attempting to **directly interact** with the **Material Plane**. The requirement that **"All abilities that interact with the world or a being in that world must be channeled through a willing and marked individual, a controlled individual, or through a corporeal avatar"** establishes **core dimensional interaction rules**.

**Fi's Primary Application**: This ability enables **[[Fi]]**'s demonstrated capability to **channel abilities through Zelda**, such as the **[[Compel Being]]** experiments with **[[Buzzhopper]]** swarms in **Chapter 11**, where **"Experimenting with using Fi's Compel magic on the buzzhoppers was a success."**

### Mark of Transference Integration
**Willing Participant Requirement**: The **"willing and marked individual"** specification aligns with **[[Mark of Transference]]** system, where **marked individuals** provide **cost-efficient channeling** for **entity abilities**. This creates **strategic incentive** for **Fi** to **maintain active marks** on **trusted allies**.

**Controlled Individual Alternative**: References **[[Assume Control]]** and related **void magic abilities** that enable **direct possession**, providing **alternative channeling** methods when **willing cooperation** is unavailable or **mark capacity** is exceeded.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Old Magic Classification**: As **magic-void** ability, Channel Ability belongs to **pre-creation magical techniques** accessible to **entities** but not **chromatic magic users**. This maintains **Entity vs. Mage** distinction fundamental to the **magical hierarchy**.

**Cost Structure Logic**: **"Cost of other ability"** indicates **no additional expense** for **channeling mechanism** itself, with **full power cost** transferred to the **channeled ability**. This prevents **cost multiplication** that would make **entity assistance** prohibitively expensive.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Cost of other ability

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Allows particular abilities to be channeled through a marked or controlled individual. All abilities that interact with the world or a being in that world must be channeled through a willing and marked individual, a controlled individual, or through a corporeal avatar.

**Channeling Mechanism**: **Entity abilities** operate through **proxy manifestation**, enabling **void-based powers** to **affect Material Plane** without **direct entity presence**. **Instant activation** suggests **established magical link** transfers **ability effects** without **casting delay**.

**Prerequisite Options**: **Three channeling pathways** provide **flexibility** for **entity operations**: **willing cooperation** (cheapest), **direct control** (expensive but reliable), or **avatar creation** (independent but resource-intensive).
