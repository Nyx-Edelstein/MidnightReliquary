## Story Integration

### Entity Power Distribution Framework
**Strategic Power Splitting**: **Transfer Essence** enables **entities** to **distribute their power** across **multiple locations** within a **realm**, creating **redundant manifestations** and **strategic backup positions**. The **three loci maximum** prevents **unlimited power dispersion** while enabling **tactical flexibility** and **operational security**.

**Locus Management Strategy**: **Entities** like **[[Ja'bu]]**, **[[Demise]]**, or **[[Lucia]]** could employ **Transfer Essence** to **establish secondary power bases**, **create emergency escape routes**, or **distribute influence** across **geographically separated areas** to **avoid single-point containment**.

**Gradual Power Redistribution**: **"Power is transferred gradually until the effect link is severed"** enables **controlled redistribution** of **entity essence** over **time**, allowing **strategic planning** and **resource allocation** without **immediate vulnerability** during **power transfer**.

### Cross-Entity Power Operations
**Other Entity Manipulation**: **"Transfer essence... of another entity"** with **1/2 Opposed Cost** enables **forced redistribution** of **hostile entity power**, potentially **weakening enemy loci** or **disrupting entity operations** through **strategic essence theft**.

**Entity Coordination Applications**: **Allied entities** could use **Transfer Essence** to **consolidate power** for **major operations**, **redistribute resources** during **crisis situations**, or **establish coordinated loci** for **synchronized attacks** against **common threats**.

**Seeker Strategic Applications**: **Advanced practitioners** working with **[[Seekers]]** could potentially **target entity loci** for **power redistribution**, **weakening dangerous entities** by **forcing essence dispersion** or **redirecting power** away from **critical manifestations**.

### Tactical Mechanics & Limitations
**Self vs. Other Cost Structure**: **"None (self)"** vs **"1/2 Opposed Cost (other)"** creates **strategic incentive** for **voluntary power redistribution** while making **forced transfers** **expensive** but **achievable** against **weakened targets**.

**Transfer Rate Scaling**: **"One minute per 5 Void Power transferred"** enables **rapid essence redistribution** for **small amounts** while requiring **extended operations** for **major power transfers**, creating **time pressure** and **vulnerability windows** during **large-scale redistribution**.

**Interruption Vulnerability**: **"Until the effect link is severed or the ability is interrupted"** creates **tactical opportunity** for **countering entity operations** by **disrupting ongoing transfers** or **forcing premature termination** of **power redistribution**.

### Locus of Power Implications
**Three Loci Strategic Framework**: The **"maximum of 3 loci of power in a given realm"** limitation creates **strategic bottleneck** where **entities** must **carefully allocate** their **manifestation capacity** between **offensive operations**, **defensive positions**, and **resource generation**.

**Realm-Specific Restrictions**: **Power distribution** appears **limited by realm boundaries**, preventing **cross-dimensional power sharing** and **requiring separate locus management** for **entities** operating across **multiple realities**.

**Locus Targeting Strategy**: Understanding **Transfer Essence** mechanics enables **strategic targeting** of **entity loci** through **[[Seal Entity]]** operations, **forced transfers**, or **disruption techniques** that **limit entity operational capacity**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Old Magic Classification**: As **magic-void** ability, **Transfer Essence** represents **pre-creation essence manipulation** accessible to **entities** but not **standard magic users**, maintaining **Entity vs. Mage** distinction in **power redistribution** capabilities.

**Void Power Integration**: **Transfer Essence** operates through **Void Power** systems, enabling **entity power management** but **remaining incompatible** with **chromatic magic** or **standard magical enhancement** techniques.

**Strategic Balance Framework**: **Three loci limitation** prevents **entity power concentration** from **overwhelming story balance** while enabling **tactical complexity** and **strategic depth** in **entity operations**.

**Time Investment Requirements**: **Gradual transfer mechanics** ensure **major power redistribution** requires **significant time investment** and **sustained vulnerability**, preventing **trivial power manipulation** during **combat situations**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
None (self)

1/2 Opposed Cost (other)

**Time Cost**:
One minute per 5 Void Power transferred

**Description**:
Transfer your essence, or that of another entity, into another object or location. Power is transferred gradually until the effect link is severed or the ability is interrupted. An entity may use this to split their power into multiple pieces, but they may have a maximum of 3 loci of power in a given realm.
