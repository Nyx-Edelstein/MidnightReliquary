## Story Integration

### Stub Entry Status & Cosmic Significance
**Fundamental Reality Layer**: Despite being marked as a stub, the Void Between Worlds represents the **foundational cosmic realm** from which all reality was created and the **primary source of existential threats** throughout the narrative, requiring substantial expansion to match its canonical importance.

**Creation Mythology Foundation**: The Void serves as the **primordial material** from which the **[[Golden Goddesses]]** ([[Din]], [[Nayru]], [[Farore]]) **"created the world from the formless Void Between Worlds,"** establishing it as the fundamental substrate underlying all existence.

### Golden Goddesses Creation & Divine Conquest
**World Creation Process**: The Golden Goddesses **"venture into the formless Void Between Worlds"** after fleeing **[[Odium]]**'s cosmic war, where they **"would attempt to create dozens of worlds amenable to life, sealed away from the influence of Odium."** [[Din]]'s specific role was **"conquering and subduing the entities of the Void"** to establish safe reality zones.

**Divine Barrier Establishment**: The creation process involved establishing **divine barriers** to separate created worlds from Void influence, with these barriers now being slowly **drained by [[Demise]]** through **"cracks in the divine barrier,"** creating the current existential threat timeline.

### Entity Source & Corruption Origin
**Native Void Entities**: The Void serves as the **native realm for entities like [[Demise]]**, **[[Ja'bu]]**, and other supernatural threats that **"every being native to the Void has access [to] Old Magics"**â€”power systems that enable reality manipulation and corruption of created worlds.

**Fae Fragment Origin**: Following **[[Hylia]]**'s destruction by Demise, her **"fragments have been scattered across the Void Between Worlds"** where **"most have been corrupted through prolonged exposure"** to Void conditions, transforming divine protectors into dangerous **[[Fae]]** entities that manipulate mortals.

### Old Magic System & Power Source
**Pre-Creation Magic**: The Void contains **"Old Magics"** that are **"a relic of the time before creation,"** representing power systems that predate and potentially override normal reality-based magic. These systems focus on **"essence" manipulation** and **control of mortal beings**.

**Mortal Access Methods**: While **"every being native to the Void"** has natural Old Magic access, **"there are ways mortal beings may gain access to the Old Magics, for a price,"** suggesting corruption mechanisms that enable void entity recruitment of mortal agents.

### Chapter 1 Divine Revelation & Current Threat Context
**Hylia's Warning**: Chapter 1 opens with **Hylia speaking "from the Void between worlds,"** describing her enemy as **"desolation and havoc; animosity and betrayal; malice, incarnate"** and warning that she **"failed in her task"** to protect the realms from Void-based threats.

**Barrier Degradation Timeline**: **[[Shesan]]**'s intelligence indicates that **[[Demise]]**'s **systematic weakening of divine barriers** represents an **active cosmic threat** with a **timeline measured in years to decades** before complete barrier failure and reality collapse.

### Infiltration & Access Points
**Perpendicularity Gateway System**: **[[Perpendicularity]]** sites serve as **intersection points between realms** that void entities can exploit for **infiltration attempts**, as demonstrated by the **"powerful entity [that] attempted to use it to enter the world"** at **[[Lanayru]]**'s guarded location.

**Guardian Beast Defense**: The **[[Guardian Beast]]** system was established specifically to **protect perpendicularity sites** from Void entity infiltration, though multiple system failures (**Faron** corrupted, **Eldin** traumatized, **Lanayru** managing damaged infrastructure) have compromised this first line of defense.

### Cross-References & Cosmic Framework
- **[[Golden Goddesses]]**: [[Din]], [[Nayru]], [[Farore]] (creators who conquered the Void)
- **[[Demise]]**: Primary Void entity draining divine barriers and threatening reality collapse
- **[[Hylia]]**: Divine protector shattered and scattered across the Void
- **[[Fae]]**: Corrupted divine fragments exposed to Void conditions
- **[[Old Magic]]**: Pre-creation power system native to Void entities
- **[[Perpendicularity]]**: Gateway sites enabling Void entity infiltration attempts
- **[[Guardian Beast]]**: Protective system defending against Void infiltration
- **[[Ja'bu]]**: Void entity that successfully corrupted Faron guardian
- **[[Odium]]**: Cosmic threat that drove Golden Goddesses into Void refuge creation
- **[[Shadow Dancers]]**: Multiverse organization monitoring Void expansion
- **[[Magic]]**: Reality-based power systems contrasting with Void-based Old Magic
- **[[Divine Barrier]]**: Protection system separating created reality from Void influence
