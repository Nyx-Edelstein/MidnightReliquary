## Story Integration

### Fae Imprisonment & Catastrophic Events
**Niesis Containment Failure**: The Temple of Time serves as the imprisonment site for **[[Niesis]]**, a **[[Fae]]** entity held in stasis using an ancient **chromatic opal scepter**. The catastrophic failure of this containment system during Chapter 7 represents both a security breach and the destruction of irreplaceable ancient technology.

**Scepter Destruction**: The loss of the original **Seeker** imprisonment device designed by Niesis herself creates a permanent gap in supernatural containment capabilities, as **[[Fi]]** analyzes the scepter was meant to "imprison, seal away, or possibly destroy Voidspawn or other entities tainted by the Void."

### Order of Sages Operations Center
**Administrative Headquarters**: The Temple serves as the **base of operations for [[The Order of Sages]]**, housing their leadership, administrative functions, and serving as the coordination center for supernatural artifact management and religious doctrine enforcement.

**Artifact Repository**: The Temple's function as a **"storehouse and repository for history and ancient knowledge"** makes it the primary location for dangerous magical artifacts, priceless treasures, and crucial historical documentation that supports the kingdom's supernatural defense capabilities.
