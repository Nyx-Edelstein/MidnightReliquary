Magic common to all affinities includes [[Imbue Object]] and [[Energy Burst]].

## QM Data
### Overview

The magic of Hyrule is not a singular thing, but rather stems from four independent sources that have been intertwined; the three Shards of the Golden Goddesses (Wisdom, Power, and Courage), and the Old Magic of the Void Between Worlds.

Additionally, magic relating to the Shards is expressed in two similar, but subtly distinct ways. 

* The first manifestation is a direct link to the powers of the Goddesses themselves, through the artifacts known as the Triforce. Wielders of these artifacts will have powers that mirror those of the Golden Goddesses.

* The influence of the Shards on the Hyrulean realms results in Divine Energy from the Spiritual Realm coalescing on the Material Plane, and the Triforce bleeds off some of this energy off into forms (“Magic Power”) that sensitive individuals may interact with. These forms of energy allow use of a secondary (but usually less powerful or more costly) manifestation of the Shard magics.

Notably, possessing the Triforce in any form does not necessarily grant the wielder the ability to use Magic, although naturally sensitive individuals may find their powers magnified in their presence. (Mechanically, they will have their affinity slowly increased over time.)

### Divine Energy Based Magic

There are three types of magical energy: Blue (Nayru), Red (Din), and Green (Farore). There are four corresponding types of magic abilities: Blue, Red, Green, and Prismatic. Any color can be used to power Prismatic abilities, but others are restricted by one’s affinity to a particular color.

Affinity occurs naturally, but somewhat infrequently in various populations, and can be towards one or more of the three types. Having affinity to all types is extremely rare in general, but notably, all heirs and rulers of the Royal Family have this trait. Moreover, gaining enough Magic Power to make effective use of the more powerful abilities is generally not possible for the average person.

It is well known that individuals capable of manipulating Magic Power tend to extol virtues of the Golden Goddesses. It is unknown, however, to what degree their personality impacts this ability, or if rather it is their personality that is impacted by the influence of the divine. Names for such individuals vary depending on culture, but are usually something along the lines of “Favored,” “Blessed,” “Faetouched,” or “Chosen.”

See the “Magic Abilities - Shard Magics” spreadsheet  for more details on specific abilities.

### Old Magics of the Void

The Old Magics are a relic of the time before creation, when the Golden Goddesses forged the Hyrulean realms from the untempered [[Void Between Worlds]]. Every being native to the Void has access these Old Magics, in a way not dissimilar to how individuals sensitive to Magic Power may use Shard-based magics. Additionally, there are ways mortal beings may gain access to the Old Magics, for a price…

Magic of this type usually centers around “essence” (the degree of influence an entity has on a given world), control of that essence, and the manipulation of mortal beings. It is controlled by “Power”, which one garners via “Mark of Transference” when the marked being gains the power-equivalent in their world (experience).

See the “Magic Abilities - Old Magic” spreadsheet for more details on specific abilities.

### Triforce-Based Magic

#### Triforce Mechanics
The Triforce is the strongest Artifact known in existence -- at least within the Hyrulean realms. A perfect copy of it exists in each world created by the Golden Goddesses, left there after their work was complete. It is capable of being present in the following forms:

1. As a whole which will allow the wielder extensive (but limited) power to remake their world according to their desires.
2. As three “Pieces”: "Wisdom", "Power", and "Courage". Each piece can bestow a significant portion of the powers of the Goddesses.
3. As “Fragments” or “Shards” (not to be confused with -the- Shards): Each piece can be further shattered into 9 fragments. Each fragment magnifies the power of an individual and provides lesser abilities related to the powers the three whole pieces bestow.

Each piece or fragment can only be wielded by individuals meeting specific criteria. Furthermore, there are also rules governing their possession:

* Fragments may be freely given away, or forcibly removed with sufficiently powerful Old Magic
* Fragments may also be "convinced" to transfer to another wielder if that person better exemplifies the corresponding traits.
* Fragments may only be joined together by individuals who exemplify the corresponding traits
* Pieces may be removed from a willing participant with the use of sufficiently powerful Old Magic
* Pieces may be forcibly removed only by another triforce wielder, provided they have been subdued.
* If a triforce wielder dies otherwise, the Piece they were in possession of is shattered and scattered immediately.
* Pieces may also, under exceptionally rare circumstances, be "convinced" to transfer to another wielder.
* The whole Triforce can be assembled by cooperation of the individual wielders, by a single wielder who exemplifies all traits, or again, by sufficiently powerful Old magic.
* The whole Triforce will remain whole until its world-remaking powers are called upon
* After its powers are called upon, the Triforce is immediately broken into Fragments and scattered, with each Fragment eventually winding up in the possession of an individual who meets the corresponding criteria

### 

#### Restrictions
Each piece has both explicit restrictions and implicit restrictions. Explicit restrictions must be met to wield a unified Piece, while implicit restrictions just mean the wielder cannot make effective use of the granted abilities (and fragments are unlikely to choose wielders who cannot make use of them...). Individuals exemplifying corresponding traits are far more likely to find themselves in possession of Triforce fragments.

See [[Triforce of Wisdom]], [[Triforce of Courage]], and [[Triforce of Power]] pages for details on each pieces' abilities and restrictions.

## Story Integration

### Central Narrative Framework
Magic serves as the fundamental supernatural system enabling the entire Legacy of the Goddess narrative, from Link's Lightsworn transformation to Zelda's Triforce-powered political maneuvering. The multi-sourced magical framework (Divine Energy, Triforce fragments, Old Magic, Void Power) provides both character empowerment and cosmic threat mechanisms essential to the story's scope and stakes.

### Story-Confirmed Magical Systems
**1. Chromatic Magic (Divine Energy Based)**:
- **Blue Magic** (Nayru): Scrying, Telepathy, Foretelling - extensively used by Zelda and Link throughout their journey
- **Red Magic** (Din): Invigorate, Transformation, Stasis - Link's primary combat enhancement system
- **Green Magic** (Farore): Healing, Soothe, biological manipulation - crucial for survival and diplomacy
- **Prismatic Magic**: Energy Burst, Imbue Object - universal applications across all affinities

**2. Triforce-Based Magic**:
- **Fragment Empowerment**: Link's death-reversal (Courage), Zelda's scrying network (Wisdom), Ganondorf's authority enhancement (Power)
- **Progressive Abilities**: Each fragment grants specific powers building toward piece-level cosmic abilities
- **Resonance Effects**: Fragments influence magical affinity development over time

**3. Old Magic/Void Power (Fi's Domain)**:
- **Divine Power Conversion**: Fi's ability to transform raw Void Power into usable Magic Power for mortals
- **Research Magic**: Fi's experimental magical development for expanding ability repertoires  
- **Bequeath Magic**: Fi's power distribution to marked individuals
- **Reality Manipulation**: Advanced Old Magic applications for dimensional travel and essence control

### Key Story Applications & Chapter Integration
**Training and Development** (Chapters 9-10, 21):
- Link's accelerated magical education under Zelda's guidance demonstrates all three color affinities
- Translation work with ancient magical texts reveals historical techniques and theoretical foundations
- Combat applications prove decisive in multiple encounters (kodongo, bandits, wolfos)

**Political and Strategic Uses** (Chapters 12, 19, 23):
- Zelda's Scrying network provides intelligence gathering capabilities essential for kingdom management
- Telepathic communication with Impa enables coordinated political maneuvering
- Prophetic dreams guide strategic decision-making regarding threats and opportunities

**Cosmic Conflict Applications** (Chapters 26, 32, 35):
- Fi's Old Magic serves as bridge between mortal limitations and cosmic-scale threats
- Triforce fragment synergy becomes crucial for confronting Void entities and dimensional incursions
- Reality manipulation abilities prepare protagonists for final confrontations

### Technological Integration Points
**Fi's Advanced Capabilities**:
- Divine Power serves as universal conversion currency between magical systems
- Research Magic allows experimental development of new abilities based on observed phenomena
- Old Magic provides access to pre-creation reality manipulation techniques
- Mark of Transference creates experience-based power feedback loops

**Artifact Enhancement Systems**:
- Triforce fragments enhance baseline magical capabilities through divine resonance
- Ancient artifacts (stone tablets, temple mechanisms) respond to sufficient Divine Power input
- Imbue Object abilities allow creation of semi-permanent magical tools and weapons

### Character-Specific Magical Profiles
**Link**: Tri-affinity combat mage specializing in Red Magic enhancement, with Green Magic healing support and Blue Magic tactical awareness. Courage fragments provide supernatural resilience and cross-species communication.

**Zelda**: Enhanced magical reserves and access to all affinities through royal bloodline, specializing in Blue Magic intelligence gathering enhanced by Wisdom fragments' scrying and prophetic capabilities. Fi partnership enables Old Magic research applications.

**Fi**: Old Magic specialist providing Divine Power conversion, experimental magical research, and cosmic-scale reality manipulation. Serves as bridge between mortal magic users and cosmic forces.

### Cross-System Interactions & Limitations
**Integration Challenges**:
- Old Magic and chromatic magic systems remain fundamentally distinct and largely non-interactive
- Triforce fragments cannot be enhanced through Divine Power imbuing or standard magical enhancement
- Void Power requires specific conversion mechanisms to become usable by mortal beings

**Synergy Opportunities**:
- Fi's marking system allows Divine Power distribution to enhance natural magical abilities
- Triforce fragment resonance slowly increases natural affinity over time in sensitive individuals
- Research Magic can reverse-engineer observed abilities for adaptation to different magical systems

**STORY VALIDATION**: The magical framework consistently demonstrates both power and limitations across all narrative applications, maintaining story tension while enabling supernatural progression and cosmic-scale conflicts.

### Canonical Authority & Story Reconciliation
**CANONICAL SUPREMACY**: All magical system descriptions confirmed through character experiences and Fi's technical explanations throughout the story. Any theoretical elements not yet demonstrated in narrative remain speculative pending story validation.

**Story-Validated Elements**:
- **Four-Source Framework**: Confirmed through Fi's explanations and character experiences across all magical types
- **Chromatic Affinity System**: Demonstrated through Link's tri-affinity training and Zelda's royal bloodline advantages
- **Triforce Fragment Mechanics**: Extensively validated through fragment progression and ability development
- **Old Magic Distinctiveness**: Established through Fi's unique capabilities and cosmic-scale applications

**Theoretical Framework Validation**:
- **Power Multiplication Formulas**: Confirmed through character capability demonstrations and combat effectiveness
- **Fragment Transfer Rules**: Validated through observed fragment behavior and transfer mechanisms
- **Magical Interaction Limitations**: Reinforced through failed experiments and Fi's technical explanations

**Integration Priority Order**:
1. **Character Experiences**: Direct magical demonstrations in story chapters take absolute precedence
2. **Fi's Technical Explanations**: Advanced magical theory provided by cosmic-level entity
3. **Historical References**: Ancient magical knowledge from translated texts and artifacts
4. **Theoretical Extrapolations**: Logical extensions from established principles pending validation

**STORY-FIRST PRINCIPLE**: Any worldbuilding elements that conflict with demonstrated story capabilities are superseded by canonical narrative events. The magical framework serves the story, not vice versa.
