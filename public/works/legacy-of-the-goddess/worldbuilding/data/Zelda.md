## Description
Zelda is the crown princess of Hyrule. She is incredibly intelligent, and prides herself on her ability to think her way through any problem. At her young age, she is already an accomplished scholar and an exceptionally talented blue mage. She has a high vision for the future of Hyrule, and has dedicated most of her life thus far to scholarship and research.

Despite [[Impa]]'s insistence, she is presently unwilling to take the crown, believing herself to be unfit for the job and having neglected much of her leadership training in favor of study. She also still holds out hope for her father's recovery. However, this has not stopped her from using the fact of her father's illness to greatly expand the scope and scale of her various projects, which some in the Royal Council find frustrating due to their high costs and seeming lack of practical feasibility.

She wears two bracers and a locket, each bearing a shard of the Triforce of Wisdom. Few know of this fact outside the Royal Family and the [[Sheikah]].
