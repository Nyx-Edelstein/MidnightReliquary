## Story Integration

### Strategic Positioning & Intelligence Gathering
**Castletown Market Operations**: The Happy Mask Salesman establishes his shop in the **Market district** specifically to gather intelligence during the cosmic crisis, positioning himself at the heart of Hyrule's information networks and political discussions.

**Entity Monitoring**: His presence during the supernatural conflicts suggests active involvement in tracking powerful entities, particularly his noted interest in **[[Morudo Geira]]** and potential plans involving **Zelda** as the **marked one**.

### Zelda Relationship Dynamics
**Marked Entity Recognition**: His ability to make statements about individuals "he could not possibly know" extends to recognizing Zelda's divine marking and cosmic significance, though he maintains plausible deniability when pressed for information.

**Strategic Distance**: While interested in Zelda's role as Hylia's champion, he appears to maintain careful distance to avoid drawing attention to himself, suggesting awareness of the scrutiny that comes with direct involvement in cosmic events.

### Supernatural Business Operations
**Entity Sealing Expertise**: His collection of masks containing sealed entities represents a form of supernatural law enforcement, removing dangerous beings from circulation while deriving power from their confinement.

**Information Trading**: His willingness to barter information about "Hyrule's history" and "greater cosmology" makes him a potential source of crucial intelligence about the ongoing supernatural conflicts and cosmic threats.

## Description
### About
A travelling collector and salesman of strange, rare, and unusual masks. No one really knows who he is or where he's from, although in [[Castletown]] he has gained a reputation for his erratic behavior, unpredictable temper, occasional displays of hysterical outbursts, and the strange powers derived from the masks he pedals. He often gets into trouble for being in places he shouldn't, and for seemingly knowing far more than he should. Most who value their sanity have learned to give him a wide berth.

### Last Seen
At his shop in the Market district of Castletown.

## QM Data
### Backstory
The Happy Mask Salesman is actually an entity of phenomenal power who delights in finding and sealing away unique and interesting entities, whose power he confines to the masks he sells and trades. Other entities may recognize or know of him, and he doesn't seem to have any malicious motivations...

### Mechanical considerations
Surprisingly, is never anywhere to be found if there is the slightest hint of danger.

### Potential plot hooks
* When engaging with players or PCs, will sometimes make statements or observations about PCs he could not possibly know, though will deny this when pressed and is not generally forthcoming with information.
* May make requests of PCs to fulfil seemingly random quests with no clear goal or motivation, with completely disproportionate rewards.
* May be bartered with for information on Hyrule's history, the greater cosmology, or perhaps for some of his wares.

Given Zelda is the marked one, unlikely to interact with Zelda too much as it would draw too much attention to himself. For now, might be looking at Geira. Might be interested in sending Zelda to fight Geira?
For now, likely to set up shop in CastleTown to gather information.
