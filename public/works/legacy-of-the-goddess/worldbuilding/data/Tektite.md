## Story Integration

### Mountain & Cave Ecosystem Threats
**Alpine Predation**: Tektite presence in **mountain environments** creates **significant hazards** for travelers to **[[Death Mountain]]**, **Goron territories**, and **temple expeditions**. Their **rock-climbing abilities** and **camouflaged burrows** make **cliff-side passages** particularly dangerous for **diplomatic missions** and **resource gathering**.

**Cave System Dangers**: **Underground ambush tactics** affect **cave exploration** and **mining operations** throughout **mountain cave networks**. Their presence would complicate **temple investigations** and **Lightsworn trials** that require **underground navigation**.

### Tactical Hunting Behavior
**Vertical Advantage**: **"Springing onto prey from above"** exploits **three-dimensional terrain** in ways that **ground-based travelers** cannot easily counter. **Long legs** enabling **"coil up and spring a few meters"** creates **extended threat radius** around **apparent safe positions**.

**Burrow Ambush Networks**: **"Camouflaged burrow"** systems suggest **territorial control** over **mountain passages** and **cave approaches**, potentially making certain **strategic routes** consistently dangerous without **local knowledge** or **specialized detection methods**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Mountain Predator Ecosystem**: Fits established pattern of **dangerous mountain fauna** including **[[Deadrock]]** (chemical defense), **[[Keese]]** (cave dwellers), and **[[Kargarok]]** (aerial threats), creating **multi-layered predator pressure** in **high-elevation environments**.

**Arthropod Integration**: Aligns with other **arthropod predators** like **[[Aracha]]** (desert ambush), **[[Devilant]]** (underground ambush), and **[[Crabbit]]** (coastal ambush), establishing **consistent arthropod evolution** toward **specialized ambush tactics** across different environments.

## Description
**Classification**:
Arthropod
**Size**:
Medium
**Diet**:
Carnivore
**Strategy**:
Ambush Predator
**Environments**:
Caves, Hills, Mountains

**About**:
Spider-like creatures that are well-suited to climbing rock-faces and cliffs. They will often lie in wait for their prey, springing onto them from above or striking out from the safety of a camouflaged burrow. Their long legs enable them to coil up and spring a few meters at a time.

**Locomotion Specialization**: **Rock-climbing expertise** combined with **spring-based attacks** creates **dual-terrain advantage** in both **vertical cliff faces** and **horizontal cave systems**. **Coiling mechanism** provides **mechanical advantage** for **rapid movement** and **escape capabilities**.

**Predation Adaptations**: **Dual ambush strategies** (aerial and burrow-based) allow **flexible tactical response** to different **prey types** and **terrain configurations**. **"Few meters"** spring distance creates **substantial threat radius** requiring **wide berth** for safe passage.

**Territorial Implications**: **Camouflaged burrow networks** suggest **long-term territorial establishment** and **potential cooperative hunting** among related individuals, making **certain mountain routes** persistently dangerous without **systematic clearance operations**.
