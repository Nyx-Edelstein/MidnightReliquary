## Story Integration

### Theoretical Capability Analysis
**Fi's Avatar Progression**: Create Avatar represents **advanced manifestation** beyond Fi's demonstrated **[[Create Ethereal Avatar]]** and **[[Create Intangible Avatar]]** capabilities. While Fi has **not used this ability** in story, the **marked individual requirement** aligns with her **[[Mark of Transference]]** system and **divine power scaling** principles.

**Three Active Mark Requirement**: The **"three active marked individuals"** specification matches Fi's confirmed **active mark limitations** from **Chapter 19**: **"we can only have three 'active' marks"** that **"allow her to act and communicate directly."** This suggests **Create Avatar** as **pinnacle manifestation** requiring **full mark capacity**.

**Cost Scaling Integration**: The **"proportional to power of active marked individuals"** cost structure aligns with Fi's established **divine power mechanics** where **marked individuals generate varying power levels** based on **experience and heroic actions**, creating **strategic resource investment** decisions.

### Physical Manifestation Implications
**Flesh-and-Blood Form**: Unlike Fi's **ethereal** (fragile, limited interaction) and **intangible** (communication-only) avatars, Create Avatar produces **fully physical manifestation** enabling **complete world interaction** and **sustained presence** until **lethal damage**.

**Personality Synthesis Mechanics**: The **"heavily influenced by the traits and personas of those individuals"** specification creates **hybrid consciousness** combining **Fi's analytical nature** with **marked individual characteristics**, potentially producing **unique behavioral patterns** distinct from Fi's standard personality.

**Statistical Optimization**: QM notes indicate **"stats will be the maximum of each stat"** creates **superhuman composite entity** combining **best attributes** of all **marked individuals**, making Create Avatar a **powerful combat/leadership manifestation**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Entity Manifestation Hierarchy**: Create Avatar represents **highest-tier physical manifestation** in **Fi's capability spectrum**:
1. **[[Telepathy]]** - Basic communication, mark-dependent cost efficiency
2. **[[Create Intangible Avatar]]** - Communication-only, marked visibility, 10/hour
3. **[[Create Ethereal Avatar]]** - Limited interaction, universal visibility, 100/hour  
4. **Create Avatar** - Full physical form, three-mark requirement, experience-scaled cost

**Marked Individual Dependency**: The **three active mark requirement** creates **strategic bottleneck** where **Create Avatar** prevents other **mark-dependent abilities** until **avatar dismissal**, forcing **tactical choice** between **powerful physical presence** and **flexible mark distribution**.

**Lethal Damage Limitation**: Unlike **ethereal dissipation** from **any damage**, Create Avatar requires **lethal injuries** for **destruction**, providing **battlefield durability** while maintaining **dismissal vulnerability** for **tactical balance**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
Proportional to power of active marked individuals

**Time Cost**:
About five minutes to form

**Description**:
Create a flesh-and-blood avatar. It will last until dismissed by the caster, or until it sustains lethal injuries.

Requires three active marked individuals. The avatar will be heavily influenced by the traits and personas of those individuals.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
10% of Average experience of active marked characters

**Time Cost**:
About five minutes to form

**Description**:
Create a flesh-and-blood avatar. It will last until dismissed by the caster, or until it sustains lethal injuries.

Requires three active marked individuals. The avatar will be heavily influenced by the traits and personas of those individuals.
**QM Notes**:
Mechanically, the stats of the avatar will be the maximum of each stat of each actively marked individual at the time of casting.
