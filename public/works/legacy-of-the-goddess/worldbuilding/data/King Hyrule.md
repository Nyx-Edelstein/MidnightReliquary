## Description
A title referring to the reigning male monarch of the Kingdom of Hyrule. Currently [[Gaillard Stefanus Hyrule IV]].

The title of King Hyrule represents the supreme secular authority within the Kingdom of Hyrule, traditionally held by male descendants of the royal bloodline. This position carries both ceremonial significance and practical governance responsibilities, serving as the counterpart to the spiritual authority embodied by Princess Zelda and her connection to the goddess Hylia.

## Story Integration
**Canonical Context**: The King of Hyrule serves as the political and military leader of the kingdom, balancing secular governance with the spiritual leadership traditionally held by the Zelda lineage. This dual leadership structure reflects Hyrule's unique blend of divine mandate and practical statecraft.

**Narrative Significance**: The current king, Gaillard Stefanus Hyrule IV, represents the established order that faces challenges from Ganondorf's rising power. The tension between traditional monarchy and emerging threats creates political complexity within the broader conflict.

## Canonical Reconciliation
**Royal Authority**: The King's role complements rather than supersedes the spiritual authority of Princess Zelda, creating a balanced power structure rooted in both divine blessing and hereditary legitimacy.

**Historical Precedent**: The numbered succession (IV) indicates an established royal tradition, suggesting political stability prior to current conflicts.
