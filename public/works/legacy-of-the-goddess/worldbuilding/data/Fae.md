**Tags**: race, su### Religious & Political Context
[[The Order of Sages]] maintains orthodox [[Hylian]] religious doctrine claiming [[Hylia]] still watches over her peoples, while secretly knowing of her ancient demise. The Sages understand the true nature of Fae as corrupted fragments and actively suppress them, fearing that public knowledge would destabilize the kingdom. The [[Seekers]] were originally founded to locate and contain dangerous Fae entities.

## Story Integration

### Major Story Appearances
**Chapter 5** - High Priestess Vestele reveals the truth about Fae as "malevolent fragments of Hylia's essence that feed on human souls" and their historical manipulation of mortals. The Seekers were originally founded to find and contain these entities, with General Arminel's sixty-year losing war being orchestrated by the Fae **Cyrae**.

**Chapter 7** - Zelda encounters **Niesis**, an imprisoned Fae at the Temple of Time who had willingly submitted to imprisonment after helping the Seekers seal other Fae. Zelda's attempt to temporarily release Niesis using Fi's power results in catastrophic scepter failure and Niesis's escape, creating an ongoing threat.

**Chapter 8** - Zelda wrestles with guilt over Niesis's escape and the destruction of the ancient scepter, recognizing her hasty decision-making led to this security crisis.

**Chapters 31-32** - Major arc involving **Lucia**, a Void-born Fae entity coinhabiting with Shesan. Lucia reveals herself as created from the metaphysical void left by Queen Cordatia's murdered family, confirms her role in the Reaffirmation legend, and establishes Zelda as Queen Cordatia's reincarnation. She appears identical to Niesis with silver hair, bound by self-imposed chromatic shackles to prevent corruption.

### Canonical Status & Character Integration
- **Niesis**: Imprisoned at Temple of Time, escaped through Zelda's intervention, current status unknown
- **Lucia**: Active coinhabitant with Shesan, provides exposition on Fae nature and cosmic threats
- **Cyrae**: Historical figure who manipulated General Arminel, bound to assassin's spear on Marauders Lake
- Multiple other named Fae scattered throughout the land with limited current influence

### Plot Significance
Fae represent one of the primary supernatural threats in the story, with their manipulation of historical figures like General Arminel demonstrating their dangerous influence. The Order of Sages actively suppresses knowledge of Fae to prevent societal chaos, while the Seekers work to contain them. Lucia's alliance with the protagonists represents a rare exception to typical Fae malevolence, though she acknowledges the corrupting nature of Fae power usage.

### Theological Implications
Fae existence challenges orthodox Hylian religious doctrine, which maintains that Hylia still watches over her people. The truth that Fae are fragments of the dead goddess represents a closely guarded secret that could destabilize the kingdom if revealed publicly.

## Description
The oldest folktales universally speak of Fae. In these grand tales, the Faerie Queen (for she universally takes the appearance of a beautiful, scantily clad woman) presides over some village, blessing the lands with fertile soil and granting its peoples luck, happiness, and long life. In exchange, the people need only make humble offerings to maintain her favor, and thus ensure their continued prosperity.

### Folk Tale Tradition
Popular folklore presents Fae in idealized form: beautiful Faerie Queens presiding over villages, blessing lands with fertility, granting prosperity and long life in exchange for humble offerings. These tales serve as cultural memory of beneficial Fae relationships while obscuring the dangerous reality.

**Reality vs. Myth**: While some Fae have indeed established beneficial relationships with communities, this represents exceptional cases rather than the norm. The romanticized folklore masks the true cost of Fae interaction and their potential for manipulation and harm.

## Canonical Description

### Nature & Origins
Fae are fragments of the goddess **Hylia** herself, possessing cosmic and godlike powers despite their fragmented nature. Most have been corrupted through prolonged exposure to the **Void Between Worlds**, transforming them from divine protectors into dangerous entities that manipulate mortals for their own sustenance.

**CANONICAL NOTE**: Story evidence from Chapter 32 reveals that some Fae, like Lucia, can be Void-born entities created to fill metaphysical voids rather than direct Hylia fragments, suggesting multiple origins for beings classified as "Fae."

### Physical Manifestation & Binding
Fae have only tenuous existence in the physical realm, with their essence typically tethered to particular items or locations. This binding serves both as anchor and limitation—they require these focal points to maintain coherent form but are also constrained by them. 

**Story-Confirmed Examples**:
- **Niesis**: Bound to chromatic opal scepter at Temple of Time (destroyed during escape)
- **Cyrae**: Bound to assassin's spear on Marauders Lake  
- **Lucia**: Uses jade pendant artifacts as power focuses to minimize corruption
- **Adrie**: Bound to amethyst pendant in Gerudo Wastes

### Power & Sustenance
Fae derive power through several mechanisms, all of which gradually corrupt their divine nature:

1. **Adoration & Worship**: Direct transfer of power from devoted subjects
2. **Sacrifice**: Most potent source - permanent sacrifice allows Fae to substitute equivalent value
3. **Manipulation**: Using abilities to influence mortal minds and essence (highly corrupting)

**Canonical Insight**: Lucia demonstrates that aware Fae can choose restraint over power, preferring death to corruption and using symbolic limitations like chromatic shackles to maintain uncorrupted nature.

### Corrupted vs. Uncorrupted Fae
**Corrupted Fae** (majority): Manipulative entities that feed on mortals, wage conflicts that destroy worlds, and pursue unknown agendas through deception and control.

**Uncorrupted Fae** (extremely rare): Entities like Niesis and Lucia who maintain moral restraint, assist rather than exploit mortals, and accept limitations to prevent corruption. Their rarity makes them valuable allies but also subjects of suspicion.

### Political & Religious Suppression
The **Order of Sages** actively suppresses Fae knowledge while publicly maintaining that Hylia still protects the realm. This deception serves multiple purposes:
- Prevents societal collapse from loss of divine protection belief
- Reduces worship that could empower malevolent Fae
- Maintains religious authority and social stability
- Supports the **Seekers'** containment efforts

**Strategic Implication**: Public revelation of Fae nature and Hylia's death could destabilize the kingdom, making Fae suppression a matter of national security rather than mere religious doctrine.

### Location Lore
[[The Order of Sages]] and their clergy make up the formal structure of orthodox [[Hylian]] religion. Official doctrine is that [[Hylia]] still watches over her peoples from above, although the Sages themselves are aware of Hylia’s demise long ago -- it being a closely guarded secret. They are likewise knowledgeable of the nature of Fae, although they do not revere them as they did Hylia, and take great pains to suppress them for fear of knowledge of the truth sending the realm into chaos.

### Important Characters
There are many Fae spread throughout the land, although none with any real measure of influence at present. Those worth mentioning include:
* [[Niesis]]
* [[Genazede]]
* [[Mardel]]
* [[Adrie]]
* [[Kylarial]]
* [[Amadera]]
* [[Lethea]]
* [[Venus]]
* [[Cyrae]]
* [[Nahira]]
* [[Lucia]]
