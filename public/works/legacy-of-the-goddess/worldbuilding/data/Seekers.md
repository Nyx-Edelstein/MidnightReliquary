## Description
A specialized religious order operating under the Faith's authority, originally founded to locate, capture, bind, and contain dangerous Fae entities. While publicly known for their role in identifying and training young magical talents, the Seekers' primary mission involves supernatural threat containment and the systematic suppression of Fae rumors and activities throughout Hylian lands.

### Story Integration
**Fae Suppression Operations (Chapter 5)**: High Priestess Vestele reveals that the Seekers were **"founded to find the Fae. All of them. To seal them, bind them, or destroy them where possible."** Their original mission involves locating dangerous supernatural entities and either **"lock[ing] them away into mundane items and toss[ing] them into the ocean, or burying them beneath the earth in deep chasms."** All records of these operations are systematically destroyed to prevent accidental rediscovery.

**Historical Foundation**: The Seekers were established after the **first Seeker assassinated General Rolfus Arminel** to end the devastating sixty-year war orchestrated by the Fae **Cyrae**. This founding member **"sealed the Fae in the spear he shoved through his brother's back,"** establishing the precedent for binding dangerous entities using the instruments of their defeat. This historical origin demonstrates both the personal cost of Fae manipulation and the extreme measures required for containment.

**Modern Dual Purpose**: While maintaining their original anti-Fae mission, the Seekers have adapted to serve as **"an order of monks, administered by the Faith, who developed their magical acuity to its limits"** to **"seek out those with innate magical talent at a young age, so that they could be properly trained and placed within society."** This public role provides cover for their supernatural enforcement activities.

**Artifact Custody Authority (Chapter 31)**: The Seekers maintain jurisdiction over supernatural artifacts, as demonstrated when **Sage Chalia** demands **"immediate transfer of Ryn's pendant to Seeker custody"** due to its Fae-influenced nature. This authority enables them to control access to dangerous magical resources and implement proper containment protocols for potentially corrupted items.

**Organizational Integration**: **Abbot Marketh** leads the **Red camp** during Chapter 26's magical research crisis, showing the Seekers' involvement in broader magical coordination efforts. Their presence in research meetings demonstrates their role as specialists in supernatural threat assessment and magical security protocols.

**Field Operations & Modern Activities (Chapters 27, 30)**: **Kellin**, a Seeker operating with Link's team, demonstrates their field capabilities and expertise in recognizing supernatural threats. Her knowledge of **"priceless artifact"** protocols and understanding that destroying Fae-related items **"might release it"** shows the organization's practical experience with supernatural containment challenges.

### Canonical Reconciliation
**Secret Mission Concealment**: The Seekers' dual role reflects the broader Faith strategy of maintaining public religious stability while addressing real supernatural threats. Their public mission as talent scouts provides operational cover for their true purpose as **"highly trained"** agents who **"covertly suss out any rumors of Fae, and to capture, bind, and banish them from Hylian lands."**

**Historical Continuity**: The organization's foundation through fraternal tragedy—the first Seeker killing his manipulated brother—establishes the personal cost and moral complexity of their mission. This origin story explains both their dedication to preventing Fae manipulation and their understanding of the extreme measures sometimes required for protection.

**Institutional Authority**: Their jurisdiction over supernatural artifacts creates a balance of power between Faith and Crown, preventing either from achieving absolute control over dangerous magical resources. This authority structure enables professional containment operations while maintaining oversight and accountability.

**Training & Specialization**: The emphasis on **"magical acuity developed to its limits"** indicates rigorous training programs designed to prepare Seekers for supernatural encounters. Their expertise in binding techniques, artifact handling, and threat assessment represents accumulated centuries of anti-Fae operational experience.
