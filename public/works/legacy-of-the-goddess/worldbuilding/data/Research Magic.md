## Description
**VP Cost**:
10 × Cost of ability × (1 - similarity of most complex similar magic)

**Time Cost**:
One day per 100 cost

**Description**:
Fi attempts to engineer a modulated attunement matrix to convert raw Void Power into magic and channel it towards a useful purpose.

The results of research are never guaranteed, and any Void Power spent on this ability may be lost without uncovering any useful information. In the event of failure, Fi will do her best to provide analysis and suggestions.

Fi suggests limiting this to magic inferred from known usages by other entities.

**QM Notes**:
* Locked magic must be unlocked by spending at least 10% of the ability's minimum power attempting to use the ability. A minimum of 100 MP must be expended. If enough power is used, the players may use the actual ability on the first try.

* If the players fail by attempting to use an ability that **does not exist**, Fi may be able to offer some information about other possible abilities (depending on how close they were to discovering them). If the players are way off and use enough power, Fi may be able to tell them conclusively that it is impossible.

* If the players fail by attempting an ability that **exists** (or is close to one that exists) but do not use enough power, Fi will inform the players they are on the right track, and roughly inform them of the actual power costs. Her estimations will increase in accuracy depending on the amount of power used.

* Fi does not know anything about locked abilities. She may however reason about what is possible by extrapolating from her current knowledge, if prompted by players. Other entities may have more knowledge.

* New abilities can be created by players if they're cool enough and have reasonable restrictions.

## Story Integration
**Canonical Context**: This represents Fi's unique ability to analyze and reverse-engineer magical phenomena through systematic experimentation. As the spirit of the Master Sword and former servant of Hylia, Fi possesses unparalleled analytical capabilities for understanding magical structures.

**Narrative Significance**: Research Magic serves as the foundation for magical advancement in the story, allowing protagonists to develop new abilities based on observed phenomena. This creates a progression system rooted in exploration and discovery rather than arbitrary level-ups.

## Canonical Reconciliation
**Fi's Role**: This ability showcases Fi's technical expertise and analytical nature, consistent with her canonical portrayal as a calculating, methodical entity. Her suggestions to limit research to observed magic reflects her practical approach to problem-solving.

**Void Power Integration**: The use of Void Power as the research medium suggests this ability operates at a fundamental level of magical reality, appropriate for Fi's divine origins and connection to the Master Sword's power.
