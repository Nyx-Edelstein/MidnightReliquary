## Story Integration

### Calendar System & Temporal Framework
**Canonical Date System**: The 280-day year with four seasons (Flows, Calm, Storms, Brisk) of 70 days each, subdivided into 35-day months, aligns perfectly with story chronology. **Chapter A2** references like **"25th of Last Storms"** and **"30th of Last Storms"** demonstrate canonical usage of this temporal system throughout the narrative.

**Seasonal Planning**: The seasonal structure supports **agricultural cycles**, **military campaign timing**, and **diplomatic scheduling** referenced throughout the story. Understanding the calendar system is essential for interpreting timeline references and strategic planning discussions in council meetings.

**Astronomical Uniqueness**: The moon's Lagrange point positioning creates **"extremely unpredictable" phases**, which explains why lunar references are largely absent from story events and religious ceremonies, unlike traditional fantasy settings that rely heavily on lunar cycles for magical or religious timing.

### Geographic Scale & Strategic Context
**Tactical Map Dimensions**: The **64x64 squares at 20x20 km each** specification provides a **2,560 km x 2,560 km total map**, establishing the massive scale of the kingdom and explaining why **portal systems** (Death Mountain to Eye of Din) and **maritime travel** are strategically essential for long-distance operations.

**Defensive Implications**: The vast territorial scale justifies the **difficulty of comprehensive border defense**, the **reliance on fortified chokepoints** like Talus Pass, and the **limitations of communication networks** that create information delays and coordination challenges throughout the story.

### Population Demographics & Political Balance
**Hylian Majority Status**: **1.1 million Hylians** establishes the demographic foundation supporting the kingdom's agricultural economy, military recruitment base, and taxation capacity referenced in governance discussions.

**Racial Distribution Context**: **300k Gerudo** and **20k Gorons** (with "similar numbers of each of the other races") provides crucial context for:
- **Gerudo civil war impact**: Large enough population to pose significant military threat when unified under Ganondorf
- **Goron alliance value**: Substantial but manageable population making diplomatic relations feasible
- **Political representation**: Demographic ratios explaining why Hylian governance dominates while other races maintain autonomy

**Economic Capacity**: Population figures support the **agricultural taxation systems**, **military recruitment capabilities**, and **economic trade patterns** that enable the kingdom to maintain standing armies, fund diplomatic missions, and support the governmental structure described throughout the story.

### Geographic Distribution Patterns
**Gerudo Concentration**: **"Most are concentrated around the coast and mesas, but a fair number live in the less arid portions"** aligns with story references to **Damaguri Shore** (coastal concentration) and the **Shifting Sands/Gerudo Mesas** territorial divisions.

**Goron Tribal Structure**: **"20k Gorons spread throughout the mountains, in tribes of a couple dozen to a few hundred"** matches **Chapter 28** revelations about **dozens of tribes** around **Death Mountain** and explains the **political complexity** of negotiating with **Chieftain Rhargon** as representative of multiple autonomous groups.

## Description
#### A place for miscellaneous facts.

---

Year length: 280 days
* There are 4 seasons: Flows, Calm, Storms, and Brisk. Each is 70 days long, and each is subdivided into a "first" and "last" month of 35 days each.
* A few date examples...
    * 15th of First Flows
    * 33rd of Last Calm
    * 1st of Last Storms

The moon is situated at a Lagrange point opposite the sun with a very slight eccentricity. As a result, the moon is never seen in the sky with the sun, appears to "rise" and "set" like the sun, and the "phases" of the moon are extremely unpredictable.

Map width: 64x64 squares, each square is 20x20 km

There are approximately 1.1 million Hylians in Hyrule (prior to end of first chapter).

There are about 300k Gerudo in the desert areas. Most are concentrated around the coast and mesas, but a fair number live in the less arid portions of the desert.

There are about 20k Gorons spread throughout the mountains, in tribes of a couple dozen to a few hundred. There are similar numbers of each of the other races.
