## Story Integration
**Canonical Appearances**: Featured in temple challenges as **enhanced specimens** requiring hero-level combat skills. The **monstrous aracha** encountered in ritual tests represents **magically amplified** versions of normal desert variants.

**Ecosystem Role**: **Primary scavengers** in desert food webs, their **colonial behavior** creates **nutrient distribution networks** across harsh environments. **Swarm coordination** makes them **effective competitors** against larger desert predators.

**Cultural Significance**: Desert travelers recognize **aracha pillars** as **navigation markers** and **resource indicators**, since colonies establish near **reliable water sources** or **trade route refuse**.

## Description
**Classification**:
Arthropod
**Size**:
Small
**Diet**:
Omnivore
**Strategy**:
Scavenging, Swarm Predation
**Environments**:
Deserts, Mesas

**About**:
Tiny, scorpion-like creatures that burrow in the sand and dirt to escape the heat. They live in large colonies, and coordinate to scavenge and take down smaller prey.

**Colonial Architecture**: Construct **compacted dirt pillars** connected by **extensive underground networks**, creating **multi-level societies** housing **thousands of individuals**. These structures serve as **temperature regulation systems** and **communal food storage**.

**Behavioral Dynamics**: **Swarm tactics** allow coordinated takedown of **oxgoat-sized prey**, with **bone-stripping efficiency** completing carcass processing within hours. **Defensive responses** trigger **mass mobilization** when colony territories are threatened.

**Venom Properties**: Carry **potent neurotoxins** in tail stingers, with **enhanced variants** posing **lethal threats** even to experienced warriors. **Antidote preparation** requires **specific desert herbs** familiar to **nomadic healers**.
