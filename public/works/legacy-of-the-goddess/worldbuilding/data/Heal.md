## Description

**MP Cost**: Arbitrary (1 MP for 5% rejuvenation)

**Time Cost**: 2 seconds per MP spent

**Mechanical Function**:
Magically repairs damage to the target, healing them and restoring them to their "true form." The spell provides:

1. **Immediate Healing**: Initial burst of regenerative energy
2. **Enhanced Recovery**: Augmented natural healing that persists until full recovery
3. **True Form Restoration**: Returns target to their natural, unaltered state

**Scaling Effects**:
- Per 10 MP spent: Can reduce wound severity by one category (critical → severe → moderate → minor → trivial)
- Higher MP investment increases recovery rate and duration

**Limitations**:
- Cannot regrow lost limbs or appendages
- Disrupted by further physical damage (50% reduction per stress point taken)
- Head injuries may result in memory/skill loss despite physical healing
- Effect negated by nontrivial subsequent damage

**Special Properties**:
- Can reverse magical transformations, returning targets to original form
- Healing rate scales with magical power invested
- Effect persists as ongoing regeneration until target reaches full health
