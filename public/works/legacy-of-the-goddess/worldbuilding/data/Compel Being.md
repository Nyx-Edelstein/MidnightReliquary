## Story Integration

### Fi's Mind Control Capabilities
**Chapter 3 Revelation**: **[[Fi]]** explicitly confirms this ability when asked **"Do you have any other abilities we should know about, Fi?"** responding **"With substantial cost, I may compel some creatures or beings to perform simple actions."** Zelda's reaction **"Wait, you mean likeâ€¦ mind-control?"** establishes the **supernatural nature** and **ethical implications** of this power.

**Chapter 11 Practical Application**: **Successful experimentation** with **[[Buzzhopper]]** control demonstrates **Compel Being** in action: **"Experimenting with using Fi's Compel magic on the buzzhoppers was a success."** The session **"took up the entirety of the late afternoon"** but achieved **complex behavioral commands** including pattern flying, marker following, and coordinated swarming.

### Intelligence-Based Cost Scaling
**Power Requirements**: The **"10x Intelligence of being (usually 100-1000 total)"** cost structure makes **compelling intelligent individuals** extremely expensive, requiring **significant magical reserves** and **strategic consideration** before use. This prevents **casual mind control** while enabling **emergency applications**.

**Strategic Limitations**: **Chapter 19** notes that **"we don't have enough Divine Power to use it liberally"** and expresses desire to **"test it further and better understand its limits once we've stored enough,"** indicating **resource constraints** limit **tactical deployment**.

## Canonical Reconciliation

**Void Magic Classification**: As **old-magic-ability**, Compel Being represents **pre-creation power** accessible to **entities** like **[[Fi]]** but not **standard chromatic mages**. This maintains **Entity vs. Mage** power distinction and **supernatural threat levels**.

**Ethical Framework**: The **"reasonable command"** limitation and **intelligence-based cost** create **built-in restraints** against **abuse** while preserving **tactical utility** for **legitimate emergencies** or **creature management**.

## Description
**MP Cost**:
10x Intelligence of being (usually 100-1000 total)

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Compel a sentient being to do your bidding. The being will follow a single command to completion, or for one hour, provided that the command is understood and does not seem too unreasonable.

**Command Limitations**: **"Single command"** restriction prevents **complex multi-step manipulation**, while **"does not seem too unreasonable"** clause provides **subject's moral judgment** as **final safeguard** against **extreme compulsions**.

**Duration Mechanics**: **One-hour maximum** or **task completion** creates **time pressure** for **tactical applications** while preventing **permanent mental domination**. **Instant activation** enables **immediate emergency deployment**.

**Intelligence Scaling**: **Cost multiplication** by **target intelligence** makes **compelling highly intelligent beings** prohibitively expensive, naturally limiting **abuse potential** against **major characters** or **sophisticated opponents**.

### Story Applications
**Fi's Compel Usage**: Fi demonstrates controlled application of Compel abilities to enforce Truth magic on marked individuals, forcing honest responses during critical intelligence gathering or when Queen's Justice requires factual testimony.

**Shesan's Triforce Demonstration**: Shesan uses Compel abilities to demonstrate Link's strong bond with his Courage fragment. In Chapter 13, she throws Link's necklace from a cliff and compels it to return, proving the mystical bond cannot be severed by simple separation - "You are bonded to it... Only your death can sever that bond."

**Lucia's Restraint Philosophy**: Lucia demonstrates extraordinary self-discipline regarding Compel usage, as revealed in Chapter 32. Despite possessing "tremendous Fae powers over hearts, minds, and essence of mortals," she voluntarily wears symbolic shackles and refuses to use her abilities except when "absolutely necessary" to prevent corruption of her nature. She explains to Zelda: "I am not willing to use my powers in any capacity, except when it is absolutely necessary."

**Strategic Advantage**: Compel represents powerful diplomatic and intelligence tool when used responsibly, though Fi's substantial energy cost makes it unsuitable for routine applications.

**Ethical Framework**: The magical system inherently respects free will through energy requirements and temporary nature, preventing casual use while allowing necessary intervention during cosmic-level threats. Lucia's restraint demonstrates that power without corruption requires voluntary limitation.
