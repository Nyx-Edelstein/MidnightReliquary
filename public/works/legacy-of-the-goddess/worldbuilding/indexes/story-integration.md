**Character Capabilities**: Character actions match documented abilities and background

### Potential Consistency Issues
**Areas Requiring Attention**

**Political Detail**: Story governmental actions sometimes lack detailed worldbuilding support
**Geographic Specificity**: Some location references need expanded worldbuilding detail
**Character Background**: Some story character actions need worldbuilding validation

## Story Development Support

### Research Priority for Active Elements
**Worldbuilding Needs for Current Story Development**

**Immediate Priority**: Expand worldbuilding for actively featured story elements
**Secondary Priority**: Develop background worldbuilding for referenced but underdeveloped elements
**Long-term Priority**: Create worldbuilding foundation for future story development

### Cross-Reference Requirements
**Story-Worldbuilding Validation Process**

1. **New Story Elements**: Check for existing worldbuilding documentation
2. **Character Actions**: Validate against character capability frameworks - **STORY CANON OVERRIDES**
3. **Location Usage**: Ensure geographic consistency and detail adequacy - **STORY CANON OVERRIDES**
4. **Magic Usage**: Verify system consistency and power level appropriateness - **STORY CANON OVERRIDES**
5. **Political Events**: Confirm governmental capability and authority alignment - **STORY CANON OVERRIDES**

**Canonical Authority Protocol**: When story elements contradict worldbuilding documentation, the story version becomes the new canonical reference and worldbuilding entries require updates to align with narrative authority.

## Maintenance Protocol

### Regular Review Requirements
**Story Integration Validation**

**Chapter-by-Chapter Review**: Identify new worldbuilding references requiring documentation
**Character Development Tracking**: Monitor character actions for worldbuilding consistency
**Magic Usage Validation**: Ensure magical elements match system frameworks
**Political Event Checking**: Verify governmental actions align with documented capabilities

### Update Procedures
**Integration Maintenance**

**New Story Content**: Add story integration sections to relevant worldbuilding entries
**Character Development**: Update character entries with story progression details
**Location Usage**: Enhance location entries with story context
**System Validation**: Adjust worldbuilding frameworks based on story canonization

*This index should be updated with each story chapter development to maintain canonical consistency and support ongoing narrative development.*
