## Overview

This index organizes worldbuilding entries by geographic region, enabling spatial navigation and understanding of regional characteristics, inhabitants, and strategic relationships.

**CANONICAL AUTHORITY HIERARCHY**: All regional information represents **Level 5: Background Material** - historical development notes that may be outdated. Story-established geographic information and regional properties override all worldbuilding documentation.

## Strategic Regional Analysis

### Natural Defense Assessment
**Most Defensible**: Eldin (mountains), Gerudo Territory (desert isolation)
**Most Vulnerable**: Central Hyrule (open terrain), Southern Frontier (plains)
**Strategic Importance**: Central Hyrule (administrative), Lanayru (maritime access)

### Resource Distribution
**Mineral Resources**: Eldin region (volcanic/mountain)
**Agricultural Potential**: Central Hyrule, Southern Frontier
**Maritime Resources**: Lanayru region, Coastal areas
**Magical Resources**: Faron region, Sacred sites

### Population Distribution
**High Density**: Central Hyrule (Castletown focus)
**Specialized Populations**: Regional race distributions (Goron, Zora, Gerudo)
**Low Density**: Frontier regions, harsh environment areas
