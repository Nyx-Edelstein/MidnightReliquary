**Last Updated**: December 2024

## Overview

This document identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and expansion opportunities in the worldbuilding database to guide future development efforts. Priorities are organized by urgency and impact on story consistency and research effectiveness.

**CANONICAL AUTHORITY HIERARCHY**: All identified gaps and development needs operate within **Level 5: Background Material** scope. Priority should be given to elements that support and enhance story canon without contradicting established narrative elements.

## High Priority: Critical Gaps

### Uncategorized Entries Requiring Type Classification
**Immediate Action Required**
- [[Adrie]] - Unknown type, requires investigation
- [[Aracha]] - Unknown type, needs categorization
- [[Deadrock]] - Unknown type, geographic location likely
- [[Fassee]] - Unknown type, character likely
- [[Genazede]] - Unknown type, needs research
- [[Great Deku Tree]] - Should be classified as Location/Character hybrid
- [[Ja'bu]] - Unknown type, deity/location connection likely
- [[Odium]] - Critical cosmic entity, requires Character classification
- [[Triforce Shard Locations (World Building)]] - Should be Location/Reference type

**Impact**: These uncategorized entries create research navigation problems and may contain critical information that's difficult to access through current indexing.

### Missing Cross-References
**Incomplete Relationship Documentation**
- Magic abilities lack comprehensive cross-references to related abilities
- Location entries missing creature habitat references  
- Character entries need relationship network expansion
- Historical events require better timeline integration

**Priority Actions**:
1. Complete magic ability cross-reference network
2. Integrate creature-location relationships from [[Environments (World Building)]]
3. Map character relationships and affiliations
4. Link historical events to character and location impacts

### Story Integration Gaps
**Canonical Consistency Requirements - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- Many worldbuilding entries lack "Story Integration" sections
- Chapter references need bidirectional linking
- **CRITICAL**: Character actions in story need worldbuilding entry validation - **STORY CANON OVERRIDES**
- **CRITICAL**: Magic usage in story requires system consistency checking - **STORY CANON OVERRIDES**
- **CRITICAL**: Location usage in story requires geographic validation - **STORY CANON OVERRIDES**

**Background Material Alignment Protocol**:
1. Identify story elements that contradict worldbuilding entries
2. Update worldbuilding entries to align with story canon
3. Mark conflicting background material as "superseded by story canon"
4. Create new worldbuilding entries for story-established elements not yet documented

## Medium Priority: System Enhancement

### Regional Organization System
**Geographic Index Development**
Currently missing comprehensive regional organization. Required development:

**Central Hyrule Region**
- [[Castletown]] (administrative hub)
- [[Hyrule Field]] (implied but not documented)
- [[Temple of Time]] (sacred site)
- Associated settlements and geographic features

**Eldin Region** 
- [[Death Mountain]] (documented)
- [[Eldin]] (documented but may need expansion)
- [[Goron]] settlements and culture
- Volcanic ecosystem details

**Faron Region**
- [[Faron Woods]] (documented)
- [[Faron]] (documented)
- [[Lost Woods]] relationship clarification
- [[Great Deku Tree]] integration

**Lanayru Region**
- [[Lanayru]] (documented)
- [[Gulf of Nayru]] (documented)
- [[Zora Basin]] and [[Zora's Pass]] integration
- Aquatic ecosystem expansion

**Gerudo Region**
- [[Gerudo Wastes]] and [[Gerudo Mesas]] (documented)
- [[The Shifting Sands]] integration
- [[Gerudo]] culture and political structure

**Frontier Regions**
- [[Akkala]] (documented but minimal)
- [[Lomei Badlands]] (documented but minimal)
- [[Plains of Ruin]] (documented but minimal)
- Border territory definitions

### Magic System Expansion
**Ability Integration Requirements**
- 50+ magic abilities need systematic organization
- School/color affinity mappings require completion
- Power level classifications missing
- Spell component and casting requirements undefined
- Combat integration guidelines needed

### Political System Development
**Governance Structure Expansion**
- [[Noble Houses]] requires detailed constituent house listings
- Provincial governance structure needs documentation
- Diplomatic relationships with other races require expansion
- Economic systems and trade relationships underdeveloped
- Military organization beyond basic guard structure needs detail

## Medium Priority: Historical Development

- Political relationship establishment chronology
- Recent technological and magical developments
- Current threat emergence patterns

### Character Development
**Historical Figure Expansion**
- Sovereignty-era leadership beyond brief mentions
- Sage succession and selection processes
- Royal bloodline genealogy completion
- Military leadership historical context
- Cultural and religious leadership figures

## Low Priority: Enhancement Opportunities

### Cultural System Development
**Societal Detail Expansion**
- Daily life and customs for each race
- Religious practices and belief systems
- Arts, literature, and cultural expressions
- Educational systems and knowledge transmission
- Economic activities and trade specializations

### Environmental System Enhancement
**Ecosystem Detail Development**
