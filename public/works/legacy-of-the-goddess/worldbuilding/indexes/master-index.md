# Master Worldbuilding Index
**Type**: Index Hub  
**Tags**: master-index, worldbuilding-navigation, research-protocol, cross-reference-hub, canonical-reference  
**Archived**: No  
**Last Updated**: December 2024

## Purpose & Structure

This master index provides systematic access to all worldbuilding data through multiple organizational frameworks. Each specialized index focuses on specific research needs while maintaining cross-referential integrity with the canonical data entries.

**CANONICAL AUTHORITY HIERARCHY INTEGRATION**: All worldbuilding data entries represent **Level 5: Background Material** in the established canonical hierarchy. This material provides context and inspiration but is **NOT BINDING** on current narrative. When conflicts arise between worldbuilding entries and story canon, story canon always takes precedence.

## Navigation Hub

### Primary Indexes
- **[Type-Based Index](./index-by-type.md)** - Organized by data type (Location, Character, Artifact, etc.)
- **[Tag-Based Index](./index-by-tag.md)** - Grouped by thematic tags for cross-cutting research
- **[Timeline Index](./index-by-timeline.md)** - Chronological organization for historical research
- **[Region Index](./index-by-region.md)** - Geographic organization for spatial reference
- **[Magic Systems Index](./index-by-magic.md)** - Magical phenomena and abilities organization

### Specialized Indexes
- **[Cross-Reference Map](./cross-reference-map.md)** - Inter-entry relationship mapping
- **[Research Priorities](./research-priorities.md)** - Gaps and expansion priorities
- **[Story Integration Index](./story-integration.md)** - Active story element tracking

## Quick Reference Categories

### Core Systems
- **Governmental**: [[The Hylian Sovereignty]], [[Noble Houses]], [[Royal Guard]]
- **Magic**: [[Magic]], [[Blue Magic]], [[Red Magic]], [[Green Magic]], [[Old Magic]]
- **Artifacts**: [[Triforce of Wisdom]], [[Triforce of Power]], [[Triforce of Courage]]
- **Divine Entities**: [[Hylia]], [[Din]], [[Nayru]], [[Farore]], [[Demise]], [[Majora]]

### Geographic Framework
- **Major Regions**: [[Hyrule]], [[Eldin]], [[Faron]], [[Lanayru]], [[Gerudo Wastes]]
- **Key Locations**: [[Castletown]], [[Kakariko]], [[Death Mountain]], [[Lost Woods]]
- **Biomes**: Referenced in [[Environments (World Building)]]

### Temporal Framework
- **Historical Periods**: See [[Timeline (World Building)]]
- **Current Events**: Cross-reference with story chapters

## Research Protocol

### Standard Lookup Process
1. **Identify Query Type**: Determine if seeking location, character, historical event, etc.
2. **Story Canon Validation**: Check if topic appears in story chapters - if so, story canon takes absolute precedence
3. **Select Primary Index**: Use most relevant specialized index for background material
4. **Cross-Reference**: Check related entries through cross-reference map
5. **Validate Story Integration**: Confirm canonical consistency and identify any conflicts

### Canonical Authority Integration
**CRITICAL**: All worldbuilding entries are **Level 5: Background Material** - reference only, potentially outdated, NOT binding on narrative. Research protocol:

1. **Story Canon First**: Always verify against established story chapters before using worldbuilding data
2. **Conflict Resolution**: When worldbuilding contradicts story canon, story canon overrides completely
3. **Gap Filling**: Use worldbuilding to fill gaps and provide context where story is silent
4. **Inspiration Only**: Treat as preparatory work and historical development notes for creative inspiration

### Recursive Research Guidelines
- Always check cross-references before concluding research
- **Story integration validation is mandatory** for any research supporting story development
- Note gaps or inconsistencies for future expansion
- Update story integration notes when relevant
- Maintain tag consistency across related entries

## Index Maintenance

### Update Protocols
- All new worldbuilding entries must be reflected in relevant indexes
- Tag additions require index updates
- Story integration updates trigger cross-reference validation
- Quarterly comprehensive review of index accuracy

### Quality Assurance
- Verify all links resolve to existing entries
- Ensure tag consistency across indexes
- Maintain alphabetical ordering where appropriate
- Check for orphaned entries or missing cross-references

## Integration Notes

This indexing system integrates with the broader project architecture:
- **Story Context**: Cross-references with chapter summaries and character development
- **Writing Synthesis**: Supports random selection for scene generation and worldbuilding consistency
- **Research Flow**: Enables efficient deep-dive research into interconnected topics
- **Canonical Authority**: Maintains consistency with established worldbuilding data
