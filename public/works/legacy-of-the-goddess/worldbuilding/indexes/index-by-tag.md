# Worldbuilding Index by Tag
**Type**: Specialized Index  
**Tags**: tag-organization, thematic-index, cross-cutting-research, semantic-navigation  
**Archived**: No  
**Last Updated**: December 2024

## Overview

This index organizes worldbuilding entries by their thematic tags, enabling research across conceptual boundaries and supporting cross-cutting analysis. Tags represent semantic relationships that transcend type categories.

**CANONICAL AUTHORITY HIERARCHY**: All tagged entries represent **Level 5: Background Material** - potentially outdated historical development notes. When using tags for research, always verify against story canon first. Story-established relationships and properties override tag-based classifications.

## Special Classification Tags

### Content Completeness
- `full-entry`: Comprehensive documentation available
- `stub-entry`: Minimal information, needs expansion
- `cross-reference-required`: Needs integration with other entries

### Research Priority
- `expansion-needed`: Requires additional development
- `canon-validation-required`: Needs consistency checking
- `story-integration-priority`: Important for narrative development

## Tag Maintenance Guidelines

### Consistency Requirements
- All magic-related entries should include relevant `magic` subtags
- Location entries require appropriate `env-` environmental tags
- Historical entries need temporal classification tags
- Political entities require governance and faction tags

### Cross-Reference Protocol
- Tags should facilitate discovery of related concepts
- Thematic groupings must maintain logical coherence
- New tags require validation against existing taxonomy
- Regular tag consolidation reviews to prevent fragmentation

### Research Applications
**Synthesis Support**: Tag combinations enable sophisticated research queries:
- `magic` + `divine-power` = Divine magical systems
- `location` + `env-forests` = Forest environments for scene setting
- `faction` + `ancient-empire` = Historical political structures
- `artifact` + `triforce` = Divine relic research

**Cross-Cutting Analysis**: Tags support analysis across type boundaries:
- All `refugee-crisis` tagged entries for understanding population displacement
- All `cosmic-warfare-victim` entries for understanding cosmic threat patterns
- All `divine-guidance` entries for understanding goddess intervention patterns
