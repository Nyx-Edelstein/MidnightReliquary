<b>About:</b>

Small, reddish birds that blend in with their surroundings, and have adapted well to living in the [[Gerudo Mesas]]. Dactos have horned beaks and long talons they use to puncture and rip apart the flesh of their prey. They subsist equally well off of scavenging, and via swarm predation of larger creatures.
