## Description
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary cost

**Time Cost**:
~ 1 sec / 1 MP imbued

**Description**:
Imbues a nonliving object with Magic Power. Imbued objects can deflect or negate attacks from Energy Burst (depending on the form of the burst) if imbued with comparable magic to the attack.

As more magic is used, the object will emit a faint glow corresponding to the type of magic used, and will become more a "conceptually pure" version of itself. For instance, a sword will become sharper, a rock will become harder, a pen will take longer to run dry, and a torch will burn brighter and longer with a steadier flame. This effect is noticeable, but usually minor.

Objects imbued with more than 1000 MP may become sentient and, with intelligence increasing roughly proportionally to MP. More than 10,000 MP is necessary for the object to be capable of making it's own decisions. The imbuer has more influence over this the more magic used.

The magic stored will decay slowly over time. Once the magic is spent, the object reverts to normal. 

**QM Notes**:
Inspiration for sentience idea is drawn from *Warbreaker*, and in particular, [Nightblood](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nightblood).
