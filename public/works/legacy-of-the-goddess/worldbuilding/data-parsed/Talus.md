## Description
Talus is the eastern-most outpost of modern Hyrule. The primary contingent of [[Hylian]] armed forces resides in Talus, where they have been mostly successful in containing the [[Blin]] at a natural choke-point dubbed the Talus Pass. There, they patrol in force, systematically crushing any Blin raiding parties who venture too far inland, and serving as a buffer to allow the kingdom time to respond when a warlord rises

Beyond Talus lies the [[Plains of Ruin]]; previously homeland to the powerful and ancient kingdoms of [[Byrna]] and [[Farwatch]]. Currently overrun by the Blin hordes.
