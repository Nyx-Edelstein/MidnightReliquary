**About**:
Stingers are manta ray-like creatures that swim in schools, found in shallow waters, rivers, and rapids. They feed on insectoids, launching themselves out of the water and into the air, using their winglike bodies to glide short distances and control their descent. They are also known to consume vegetation like kelp and fronds. True to their name, they have a stinging tail, which they use primarily to fend off predators.
