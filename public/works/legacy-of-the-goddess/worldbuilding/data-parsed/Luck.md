## Description
**MP Cost**:
A minor (but nontrivial) fixed cost

**Time Cost**:
About a second

**Description**:
The target tends to have more "luck," in that particularly bad things happen less often to them, and more often to anyone trying to do them harm. This effect isn't predictable and dissipates in about an hour, or as soon as one tries to rely on it.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
10 MP per application

**Time Cost**:
One second per application
Application lasts for one hour

**Description**:
The target tends to have more "luck," in that particularly bad things happen less often. This effect isn't predictable and dissipates in about an hour, or until the application is consumed.

**QM Notes**:
While active, allows the target of the ability to redo any unfavorable resolution as if it never happened. The effect is consumed upon use.
