## Description
The area at the edge of the [[Gerudo Wastes]], between the [[Gerudo Mesas]] and [[Damaguri Shore]]. It is necessary to cross to travel between the Mesas/Highlands and the Shorelands, and is exceptionally hostile to life. Few [[Gerudo]] reside here; the closest thing to residents are the bandits and outlaws who occasionally camp out for extended periods of time hoping to ambush trade caravans.
