**About**:
These creatures originate from the Void, and feed off of magic. Wizkin are actually sentient beings, although they are so alien that any sort of meaningful communication is all but impossible. They appear as amorphous clouds of energy, usually bounded by a garment resembling a robe, and are vaguely humanoid in shape. They have been observed to partake in complex rituals involving dances and chanting, although even the most learned scholars have been unable to discern the reasons or motivations behind these behaviors. Wizkin are exceptionally dangerous, often attacking on sight.
