## Description
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary

**Time Cost**:
Proportional to magic spent (short)

**Description**:
The user concentrates on a form, and then charges and releases a burst of energy which fills that form. The energy can be in whatever form the user imagines, but with restrictions based on the affinities of the user (blue=water/ice-based, red=fire-based, green=electric, air, or nature-based). Practiced users have more fine control over the form, but even the most experienced mages can only manage relatively crude shapes.

The total change to the environment (including heat change or kinetic energy imparted) is limited by MP spent. The forms created in this manner are temporary; the ability does not create permanent objects.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary

**Time Cost**:
3s / 100 MP spent

**Description**:
The user concentrates on a form, and then charges and releases a burst of energy which fills that form. The energy can be in whatever form the user imagines, but with restrictions based on the affinities of the user (blue=water/ice-based, red=fire-based, green=electric, air, or nature-based, prismatic=no restriction).

The total energy change to the environment (including heat change or kinetic energy imparted) is limited to 100J change in physical energy per MP spent. The forms created in this manner are temporary; the ability is not known to create permanent objects.

**QM Notes**:
Can be used with any type of magic, but for instance, a person with Blue affinity can only use water/ice-based forms.
