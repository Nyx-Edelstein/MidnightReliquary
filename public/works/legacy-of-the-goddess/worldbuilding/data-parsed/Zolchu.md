**About**:
Slimy, amphibious, gelatinous monstrosities that lurk in shallow waters in various environments. Aside from scavenging, they hunt by approaching their prey while it is distracted or sleeping, paralyzing it with potent neurotoxins, and then enveloping and digesting them slowly over time. They have also been known to drop from trees or cliffs onto their prey. They are extremely resilient, and can even regenerate their whole body from a large enough piece given enough time.
