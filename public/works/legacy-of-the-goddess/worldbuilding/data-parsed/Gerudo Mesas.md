## Description
The largest and most populous area in the [[Gerudo]] lands, with about 65% of all Gerudo living here until very recently.

The primary source of food for the Gerudo people is derived from herding [[Oxgoat]]s in this region. The main impediment is keeping the Oxgoats alive and healthy, protecting them from the various predatory species here.
