## Description
**MP Cost**:
A high, fixed cost

**Time Cost**:
About a minute

**Description**:
Transform one's body, or the body of a willing or subdued target to that of another form. Each person has a single, predetermined alternate form. It is known that this form is somehow correlated with their personality, but it is not in general predictable (there are always myriad exceptions to any proposed classification schemes).

In general, the alternate form magically exaggerates the target's nature, altering their personality and making both their strengths and weaknesses more apparent. It also changes their physical appearance to suit, usually to the effect of animalistic or monstrous transformations. These changes quickly fade after about an hour unless refreshed.

If a partial transformation is not completed, the target will quicky revert to their base form.

With great practice, one may "master" their own transformation. Every successful transformation reduces the time it takes to complete the transformation by a second or two, to a minimum of 3 seconds. The process is excruciatingly painful, and not for the weak-willed.

The cost (MP and time) to reverse one's own transformation is negligible, but on others it requires roughly the same amount of MP and time as was originally spent.

If cast on an unwilling target, the ability can be dispelled for that target with use of [[Heal]] or another Transformation.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
**Initial** 5 MP per alteration, up to 10 alterations.
An alteration consists of temporarily increasing the target's three highest approaches by 1 and reducing their three lowest approaches by 1, or increasing the two highest approaches by 1 and reducing the two lowest by 1. Which mode depends on the delta between the middle two approaches.

**Secondary:** Half cost of Invigorate, with the same effects of Invigorate. At this point, the user will transform into the alternate form.

**Time Cost**:
Six seconds per alteration

**QM Notes**:
Mechanically, this will temporarily alter the target's approaches. Unless 10 alterations are made, the effects quickly fade. Doing this repeatedly may leave the target physically exhausted.

After 10 alterations, the target will transform. After an hour, the effect will fade precipitously over the course of a minute unless refreshed. If sustained for long periods, the target may begin to lose their humanity until they spend significant time back in human form 

The exact details of transformations are up to narrative fiat.
