**About**:
Massive herbivorous creatures raised for their milk, meat, and usefulness as beasts of burden. There are many varieties bred specifically for different niches, and some wild species exist in more remote areas.

Although some features may be more or less prevalent among breeds, Oxgoats generally have large protruding horns, powerful legs, dense fur, and thick hooves. They are surprisingly agile, and can climb steep inclines with little effort. On level terrain, some Oxgoat species can even outrun horses over short distances. These factors combine to make Oxgoats excellent beasts-of-burden, and an adequate alternative mode of travel for those that cannot afford horses.
