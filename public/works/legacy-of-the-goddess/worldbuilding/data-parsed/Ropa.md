**About**:
Reptilian creatures with roughly a dozen tentacle-like appendages, each ending with pincers. Most are fairly small -- no bigger than two fists -- but they have been known to grow much larger. They thrive in sandy areas, where they burrow underground both to avoid predators and to ambush prey. They will eat almost anything, although mostly subsist off of small animals.
