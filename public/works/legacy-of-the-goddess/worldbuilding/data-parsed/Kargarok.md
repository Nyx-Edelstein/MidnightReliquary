**About**:
Also known as "Dread Shadows" and "Sky Reapers." Many travellers have lost their lives or livelihoods to these fearsome creatures.

Kargaroks are the terrors of the skies, boasting four-meter long wingspans and talons the size of an adult Hylianâ€™s forearm. They are apex predators, swooping down from on high to rend apart their prey with their monstrous talons. They feed on pretty much anything they can kill, and can travel for days on-end, migrating with weather patterns and availability of prey.
