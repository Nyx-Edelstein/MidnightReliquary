**About**:
A cross between a boar-like animal and a primate, these creatures bear a striking resemblance to Blin. Grubbers have two long forearms which they use for climbing and swinging between branches. However, they walk and run on all fours, having thick hoof-like knuckles. They also have long snouts which they use to sniff out burrowing creatures and root up vegetation. Like Blin, they often have long, protruding tusks and horns. The only location they are found in Hyrule is the southern marshlands around the Hylia River.
