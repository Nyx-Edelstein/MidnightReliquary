**Description**:
Seal an entity away into a pocket dimension, entirely removing their presence and influence from a world. The entity (their bound essence or an avatar) must be unable to move or resist. If used on an object containing only a piece of an entity's power, only that part of their power is sealed.
**QM Notes**:
An entity may normally only have three loci of power in a given realm. Having one sealed effectively reduces the maximum loci available to that entity.
