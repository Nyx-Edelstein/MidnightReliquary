## Description
### About
Resides on an islet just east of the [[Forgotten Temple]]. Once a powerful [[Fae]] who was said to bless heroic travelers -- if they were willing to accept her price. She has not had any real measure of influence since the [[Blin]] invasion a thousand years ago, and her power has waned significantly.
