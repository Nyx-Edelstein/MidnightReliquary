## Description
**MP Cost**:
10% of character's total experience (equivalent cost to Mark of Transference)

**Time Cost**:
One minute per 100 power spent

**Description**:
Unlock the spiritual potential of a marked being, allowing them access to the magics of their realm, even if they do not have any natural affinities or sensitivities by default. All affinities are immediately set to Max(1.00, current+1.00).

Additionally:
 * For every 5 experience earned by the character during a harrowing trial, they may increase one of their affinities by 0.1 points. Affinities increased in this manner cannot exceed 5.0.
 * Upon completion of a harrowing trial, the character either gets 10000 bonus experience to increase Versatility (by way of normal cost), may increase an affinity by 2.0 (max 5.0), or may increase Physical and Magical stress cap each by 10 (max 40). This generates 8500 +/- 10% VP.
