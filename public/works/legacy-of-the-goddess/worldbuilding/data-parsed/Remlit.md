**About**:
Something like a cross between a flying squirrel and a lynx. They are ambush predators, silently stalking and hiding in trees, shrubs, or tall grass, before pouncing at their prey. Remlits have adapted towards relative docility around Hylians, who sometimes keep them as pets to chase away other creatures like [[Helmarat]]s and [[Buzzhopper]]s.
