**About**:
Small, dark birds with long, curved beaks. They survive mostly via scavenging, although often they will lie in wait, and swarm small animals or wounded creatures when given an opportunity. Although they act aggressively from a distance (or when in groups), they are decidedly skittish, and will flee at the first sign of active resistance.

They are fond of collecting shiny objects, which they will return to their nest to present to their mates. They have been known to abscond with random valuables ranging from rupees and jewelry to small pieces of arms and armor. Some less scrupulous types keep them as pets for this reason.
