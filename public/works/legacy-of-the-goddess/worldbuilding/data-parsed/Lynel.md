### Overview
Lynels are a race of sentient, centaur-like lion people. Their indomitable might, unmatched speed, and frightening intelligence make them the apex predators of apex predators. Averaging nearly a metric ton, adult Lynels need to consume the better part of a full-grown [[Oxgoat]] per day to fuel their metabolism. This fact alone is perhaps the only reason they have not expanded further than the fertile grasslands of the [[Lomei Badlands]] and [[Drenen Valley]] regions to overrun the entirety of the known world.

They live and roam in prides of roughly a dozen or so -- a pack lead by a powerful male, one to several female consorts, and their offspring. Lynels are extremely territorial and aggressive creatures, often dueling to the death even with their own kind when the requisite social niceties are not observed. Indeed, they will attack on almost any provocation; interlopers must be mighty enough to earn their respect, deferential enough to adequately acknowledge the other’s dominion over the territory, and nonthreatening enough to not be considered competition.

Although not strictly necessary given their impressive strength, Lynels have been known to forge primitive weapons from stone, bone, and wrought iron. Quite a few are able to use Red Magic, though rarely with any bit of subtlety.

Lynels often hunt for sport, with their most worthy game being [[Kargarok]]s and [[Goron]]s.

Notably, the Lynel are preyed upon by [[Gerudo]] males seeking trophies in the form of their horns, hooves, or skulls as proof of their strength and bravery. Few succeed. Still, this has put considerable selection pressure on the Lynels over the last few hundred years.

### Important Characters
[[Kiat the Warmonger]]
* Arguably the strongest living creature outside the Guardian Beasts. Wields a pair of shards of Power (and also commands a massive harem). Other Lynels come from far and wide to pay him homage, and to beg his blessing and the right to petition [[Genazede]]. Seldom is he impressed with their offerings.

### Writing
	“See?” Farore said. “It’s easy. I've cataloged over forty trillion base templates to select from, indexed by prominent features and further restricted by genesiological cohesion and viability in available ecological niches. You don’t even have to worry about the combinatorial--"

	"No," Din replied.

	Farore started, her face going flat. “Oh, come on! You don't want to be shown up by Nayru, do you? She created these fascinating amphibious tetrapo--"

	"You know that won't work on me."

	Farore huffed, stomping her foot and crossing her arms. Stubborn as always, Din continued to meditate, completely unmoved by Farore’s insistence on doing something to break the monotony of her routine.

	A few moments passed as Farore bit at her lip, considering her options. Finally, an idea struck.

	"You know, I'm going to keep asking until you give in. It'd be less effort if you just humor me and--"

	"You know how I respond to coercion." Din replied, cutting Farore off as was oft to do.

	"Gah!" Farore exclaimed, pointing a finger. "You --- dammit, Din! I don't give Helmarat's ass about your 'Game-theoretic Considerations!' I just want to share in this experience with you. Is that so much to ask?!" She paused, adopting her best attempt at an irritable, petulant expression.

	Din opened an eye, breaking from her meditations briefly to study her counterpart. "Don't think I don't know what you're doing."

	A pause, and a sigh. Din stirred, opening her eyes and releasing her stored energy. The white flames covering her body flickered and dissipated as she descended towards the ground. Farore waited gingerly for the response, doing her best not to betray her true emotions.

	A moment of silence passed between the two. Finally, Din shook her head and raised an eyebrow. "And if I do this, you will cease these distractions. I have your word?"

	"Yes!" Farore replied without hesitation, throwing her arms into the air. "Yes. Of course, Din. You have my word."

	-o-o-o-

	"GAH! WHAT THE HELL?!"

	It was all she could do not to smirk. Din continued her meditations, pretending to be completely oblivious to Farore's continued blathering. Still, despite her best effort, her lips did curl upwards a fraction of a millimeter.

	"How am I supposed to work with THIS?! They need almost ONE HALF THE NATURAL ENERGY UNIT -- PER DAY -- just to SURVIVE!"

	“Oh, I’m sure you’ll figure it out. Now if you don’t mind -- we did have an agreement,” Din said, letting just the barest hint of impishness seep into her voice.

	Farore huffed and stalked away. Din took a perverse pleasure in her sister's vexation. Although she knew it would come back to bite her, in this moment at least, she was thoroughly pleased.
