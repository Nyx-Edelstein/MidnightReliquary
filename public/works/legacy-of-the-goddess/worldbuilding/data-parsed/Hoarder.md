**About**:
Also known as “Spiny Beetles,” these fist-sized creatures skitter about with the protection of a hard carapace, covered with dozens of easily detachable spines. They are mostly harmless, and will flee from almost anything. Still, their spines carry a potent venom which causes extraordinary pain and may induce muscle spasms in large doses.

They are found in most environments, and often live in small burrows, leaving only to gather food and scurry back before they attract the attention of predators.
