**Size**:
Medium
**Diet**:
Omnivore
**Environments**:

**About**:
Octopus-like creatures that are extremely skittish, and rarely seen except by naturalists who know how to find them. They have been known to lob rocks and other objects from far distances, presumably as a tactic to ward off invaders.

## QM Data
They are actually sentient creatures that are just too alien to meaningfully interact with other races. They build large sprawling labyrinthine dwellings deep in lakes and around coastal shores. They are able to adapt their bodies to both freshwater and saltwater, given time to adjust.
