## Description
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary

**Time Cost**:
Proportional to magic spent (medium)

**Description**:
Magically heals minor wounds with an initial burst, and then increases the target's natural recovery abilities.

The rate of recovery increases with magic spent, and the effect lasts until fully recovered. Suffering any nontrivial damage will negate the effect.

Cannot be used to regrow limbs. Can be used to reverse [[transformation]].

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
Arbitrary (1 MP for 5% rejuvenation).
Per 10 MP spent, can (one-time) reduce the severity of a wound (critical -&gt; severe -&gt; moderate -&gt; minor -&gt; trivial)

**Time Cost**:
2 seconds per MP spent

**Description**:
Magically repairs damage to the target, healing them and restoring them to their "true form." Augmented recovery lasts until the target is fully recovered.

Taking a physical stress point will reduce any active effect by 50% per stress point.

Cannot be used to regrow limbs. Will heal head injuries, but the target may lose memories and skills depending on the severity.

Can be used to reverse transformations.
