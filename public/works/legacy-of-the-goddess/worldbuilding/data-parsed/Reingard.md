## Description
### Aliases
* The Wanderer
* Wandering Swordsman
* Jurik

### About
The Wanderer stands at a hulking 6 foot 6, and wields a Greatsword of similar length. Stoic, strong, and pragmatic, he possesses incredible combat capability. Knowing that he is cursed to be forever be hunted by demonic spirits, he largely shuns civilization, and is intent on solving his problems himself. He has not always chosen solitude, but after one too many close companions met a gruesome and untimely end due to his curse, he eventually decided it was better than to add to the painful and tragic memories.

### Last Seen
Camping in the mountains south of [[Drenen Valley]]

## QM Data
### Backstory
Long ago, when Reingard was a mortal man known as Jurik, he was betrayed by Sabel, a close friend and the leader of his mercenary troupe, the Reklegen. As a result of this betrayal, everyone he once knew has been slain, and he now finds himself a world-hopping refugee constantly traveling to survive. He is on a quest to find power enough to stop Sabel.

When traversing the Void, a powerful, crazed entity came into contact with Sabel, and entered into a bargain with him. The entity promised Sabel immortality and all of its power on one condition: that Sabel kill all those who ever loved him.

Reingard is now the only person in existence remaining that once loved Sabel, and thus the only remaining roadblock to Sabel's ascension. Determined to prevent Sabel at all costs, Reingard is constantly on the move, keeping himself alive, growing stronger through combat and searching for some way to stop his once-friend.

### Mechanical Considerations
Though Sabel is prohibited from venturing into the corporeal world, he knows of Reingard's presence in Hyrule. Lacking a corporal form and unable to assault him directly, Sabel uses [[Scry]]ing, [[Telepathy]], [[Compel Creature]], and [[Compel Being]] to seek Reingard's death. From Reingard's perspective, he is constantly beset by all manner of foe, and cannot trust anyone he comes into contact with.

Reingard has exceptional combat ability, and dominates his foes with brute strength. He can easily stand toe-to-toe with a Lynel (though only because of heavy reliance on [[Luck]] and [[Rejuvenate]], which is the only magic he knows). He is effectively biologically immortal due to regeneration, as well as having the ability to remake his body given enough time.

### Potential Plot Hooks
His existence is a hushed rumor on towns bordering the mountains to [[Drenen Valley]] and the [[Lomei Badlands]]. In recent years, a worrying number of [[Lynel]]s began venturing into [[Hylian]] lands, requiring concerted efforts on the part of militia and standing forces to drive back. Since his appearance a little over a year ago, the Lynels incursions have all but stopped. Locals legends claim everything from him being a demon from another dimension to being a champion sent by [[Hylia]] to protect them.
* Can be found if players follow rumors or begin searching for [[Triforce of Power]] shards.
* Can be recruited if convinced of Demise's existence and motivations, though will likely choose to operate solo.
