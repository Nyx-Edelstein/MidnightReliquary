## Description
The most densely-populated area of Gerudo influence, with various small villages and towns along the coast. Only few Gerudo live here permanently, as most are nomadic. Still, approximately 60-70% of the Gerudo people live here at any given time.

Barracks-like group housing is common, with little thought being given to privacy, as the society is almost exclusively female.

Males young enough to still be alive / not yet sent out on their trials make their home in one of two larger cities: Selseib (East) and Kamorh (West). They are not permitted to leave without escort, and are kept under close supervision.
