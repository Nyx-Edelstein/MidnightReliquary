**About**:
These bugs are best described as flying nightmares. They are insectoid creatures that are approximately as big as a finger. Their sting is exceptionally painful, often causing delirium, and a dozen or so can easily be lethal. Likewise, their mandibles pack a mean bite, and it can be difficult to force one to release after it clamps down.  Extremely territorial, and will attack en-masse if the hive is threatened.

They subsist mostly off of nectar, which is processed into honey. However, they also regularly feed off of other insectoids, the carcasses of creatures left by larger predators, and even small animals that stray too close to their nests. Save for a handful of species that have evolved adequate defenses, most creatures give them a wide berth.
