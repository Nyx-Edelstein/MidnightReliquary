## Description

Small
**Diet**:
Herbivore
**Strategy**:

Mountains

**About**:
Extremely agile squirrel-like creatures, with an interesting and unique defense mechanism. When attacked, their bodies undergo a rapid chemical alteration, making their exteriors hard as rock (and equally unpalatable). This state may last for several minutes to a couple hours before reverting to their normal form. They are only found at high elevations, just around the tree-line.
