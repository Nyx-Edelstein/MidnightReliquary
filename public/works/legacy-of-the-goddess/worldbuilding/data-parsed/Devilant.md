**About**:
Devilants are solitary creatures that burrow underground and wait until their prey gets close, before leaping from the ground and running it down once it comes within range. They can cover a surprising distance in a burst of speed before needing to stop and recuperate. Their powerful mandibles are strong enough to crush bone.
