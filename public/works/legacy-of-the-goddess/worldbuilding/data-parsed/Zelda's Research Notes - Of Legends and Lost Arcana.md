## Description
**Item:** The Minish Cap 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** Some of the oldest folktales tell of a hidden race of people known as the Minish, who were so small as to be impossible to see with the naked eye. Legend has it that the people of Farwatch possessed a magical cap that allowed the wearer to shrink to minuscule sizes, thus allowing them to communicate with the Minish, who aided the kingdom in discovering traitors. 

**Notes:**: Features prominently in older records as a cultural reference, but unsubstantiated by any authoritative sources.

**Status:**: Completely bunk. Result of a propaganda campaign designed to control the populace.

**Item:** The Cane of Byrna 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** An item of immense power, said to have been entrusted to the people of Byrna by Hylia herself when the Dominion of Byrna was founded. Legend says it was capable of deflecting magical attacks, invigorating its wielder, and protecting them from all harm. 

**Notes:**: Apparently it was used as a symbol of power and authority in the Old Kingdom, and was lost following the Blin invasion. Notably, any mundane object imbued with enough magic can deflect magic attacks. But what's with the other effects? Possibly worth following up on.

**Status:**: Actual item that exists and does pretty much exactly that. Automatically repels magical attacks, provides unlimited stamina, and marginally reduces the severity of any injuries by two levels (as well as reducing stress taken by a flat 5 points). Sadly, it's power has long-since waned. It may be recharged (or altered to be fueled by personal magic), but doing so would require a lot of effort.

**Item:** The Lovers' Rings 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** A pair of magical rings that was said to link the hearts and minds of true lovers together, allowing them to share thoughts and feelings even at great distances. 

**Notes:**: While it's possible items like these exist, I suspect it may just be a cover for use of fragments of Wisdom.

**Status:**: Just a cover for usage of Wisdom.

---

**Item:** The Basilisk's Gaze 

**Classification:** Folklore 

**Description:** A common myth says that the Lightsworn of yore could freeze their enemies to stone with little more than a glance. 

**Notes:**: Although it's well known that much magical lore has been lost to time, this ability doesn't fit with our current understanding of Red, Blue, or Green magics. Perhaps it was something entirely different? Or perhaps it never existed at all.

**Status:**: [[Stasis (Individual)]] and [[Triforce of Power]] ability. The knowledge that Power fragments let you do this has been lost to time (it's also ridiculously expensive unless you have a lot of magic and several fragments).

---

**Item:** The Frozen Armies 

**Classification:** Folklore 

**Description:** Legends say that Hylia once descended from above and froze two entire armies in place until their leaders could agree to an armistice. 

**Notes:**: Could be linked to tales about the Basilisk's Gaze?

**Status:**: [[Stasis (Location)]] and [[Triforce of Power]] ability.

---

**Item:** Lens of Truth 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** An artifact said to be used by the inquisitors of Farwatch to discover truth, make the incorporeal real, and pierce all illusion. 

**Notes:**: ??? — I forget the source of this one, but always found it intriguing.

**Status:**: Complete bunk, same as the Minish Cap.

---

**Item:** Rod of Seasons 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** A rod said to be able to control the weather and seasons. An old folktale says an evil king once used its magic to threaten his subjects into submission when they attempted to rebel. 

**Notes:**: Cultural references only, and not mentioned in any authoritative sources. How would something like this even work?!

**Status:**: Complete bunk. Sometimes it's just a story. (Alternatively: Possibly result of Sacrifice?)

---

**Item:** Pendant of Amethyst Sands 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** A pendant said to be worn by a powerful bloodmage named Moraga, who supposedly spearheaded the Gerudo rebellion. Legend has it the pendant gave her eternal life in exchange for the souls of those she killed. 

**Notes:**: Interesting, but likely little more than a scary tale told to children.

**Status:**: Conflates a couple things. One is the boons granted by Morudo Geira to her followers during the Gerudo wars, and the other is an amethyst pendant that contains a Fae ([[Adrie]]). The pendant was indeed used by a person named Moraga who was famous for blood magic and lived around the same time, but in historical accounts she got conflated with the Gerudo due to similarity in names.

---

**Item:** The Champion's Trials 

**Classification:** Folklore 

**Description:** A common element of many folktales. In them, a hero journeys far and wide, fighting wicked monsters, completing harrowing challenges, and unlocking their true potential as they earn the goddesses' favor. 

**Notes:**: I find it odd that this is such a prevalent theme. Could there be something real behind it?

**Status:**: [[Unlock Potential]]

**Item:** Aghan's Ring of Dominion 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** A ring that was said to put the wearer under the spell of its creator, forcing them to do their bidding. Allegedly used by Aghan, a senator of the Dominion of Byrna, to control and hold sway over his political opponents. 

**Notes:** A ring matching the exact description from a painting and that of several reliable historical accounts was confirmed and cataloged by the Order of Sages in year 171 of the Forsaken Era, but was subsequently lost. Their notes suggest the ring to be a completely mundane item. Perhaps its power had simply waned, or the source of Aghan's ability was something else entirely. Or maybe it was all made up. Could this be related to the power of compels that Fi mentioned?

**Status:**: There isn't any ability that lets you do this. There's [[Assume Control]] and [[Wrest Control]] but they require large amounts of Void Power and can generally only be used for short times or with absurd amounts of VP.

The myth around the ring was actually started by Aghan himself, playing into his less-than-stellar reputation among a commoner faction. He used the myth as a way to cut deals with his political opponents and allow them to take action they otherwise wouldn't for fear of alienating their supporters. No one who mattered ever took the rumors seriously, but the stories persisted past his death and eventually grew into legend.

This rumor may start players down trying to figure out Assume Control and Wrest Control, but they're going to have several false starts when they inevitably get key details wrong.

**Item:** Golden Gauntlets 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** Gauntlets said to unlock the true strength of the wearer, allowing them to perform supernatural feats of strength. 

**Notes:**: Almost certainly a misdirection for use of fragments of Power, and a poor one at that.

**Status:**: Just fragments of Power.

---

**Item:** Fae 

**Classification:** Folklore 

**Description:** The oldest folktales speak of marvelous and beautiful creatures known as Fae. In these grand tales, the Faerie Queen (for she always takes the appearance of a beautiful, scantily clad woman) presides over some village, blessing the lands with fertile soil and granting its peoples luck, happiness, and long life. In exchange, the people need only make humble offerings to maintain her favor, and thus ensure their continued prosperity. 

**Notes:**: I've been meaning to look more into this. Curious how abruptly mentions of Fae fell out of favor in historical accounts.

**Status:**: [sarcasm]They're completely harmless beings of magic, beauty, and wonder.[/sarcasm]

**Item:** Fire Rods, Ice Rods, Wind Rods 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** Older tales commonly feature rods such as these that could channel magic directly. In these tales, the rods were usable even by those without magical affinity and without training. 

**Notes:**: Seems to be plausible, at least. Energy bursts are a well-known and widely used application of magic. To my knowledge, there is no known way of imbuing an object such that it can accomplish the same feat, but it's entirely believable that the knowledge of how to do so has simply been lost, and yet to be rediscovered. (Though certainly not for lack of trying.)

**Status:**: This has never been possible with ordinary magic -- they're just fanciful tales spun up by authors to write stories that featured commoner heroes in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. That said, things like this could conceivably be created using the [[Triforce of Wisdom]].

---

**Item:** The Zora's Tunic 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** Mentioned in a few folktales. In them, a hero is granted a magical tunic by the Zora people as thanks for his aid. Supposedly it allows for underwater breathing. 

**Notes:**: Who knows, where the Zora are concerned.

**Status:**: It's actually a magical pendant created by Nayru that allows for partial transformation into a Zora. The Zora actually used this when a hero came to their aid during the Ja'bu crisis.

---

**Item:** Sandals of Ascension 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** Supposedly these winged sandals were a gift from Hylia to Queen Nialay Proventia Zelda Hyrule I of Farwatch. They were said to allow the queen to ascend into the sky and speak directly with the Holy Mother. 

**Notes:**: ??? — All manner of nonsense can be found if you go back far enough. I hesitate to include this one, and only do so because it is also well known that Nialay was a prominent Lightsworn and a direct descendant of Hylia.

**Status:**: Completely bunk. I don't particularly want to give players Skywalkers.

---

**Item:** The Hero of Storms / Gale Boomerang 

**Classification:** Folklore / Artifact 

**Description:** A common folktale tells of a hero who could hurl boomerangs with such ferocity that they could calm storms and disperse rains. In the story, the hero uses this power to defeat a gigantic sea serpent that terrorized the coastlands. In some versions this was the hero's own power, and in others it was that of a magical boomerang. 

**Notes:**: No idea. Only including this due to its uniqueness.

**Status:**: Bunk -- it's just a story. The sea serpent is real though.

---

**Item:** Soulsteel 

**Classification:** Folklore 

**Description:** Some accounts of the Blin invasion refer to terrible voidspawn bearing weapons made of "soulsteel." They claim the most powerful of Blin warriors forged these weapons from their own souls, and that any wounds inflicted by them would never heal. Some accounts further claim that these weapons could effortlessly cleave through even the toughest metal. 

**Notes:**: This is almost certainly little more than the result of embellishment and hyperbole stemming from accounts of bloodrage that grew over the ages.

**Status:**: Not even the slightest bit of exaggeration.

---

**Item:** The Master Sword 

**Classification:** Magical Artifact 

**Description:** Also known as "The Sword of Evil's Bane." A common element in many legends; said to have the power to seal away darkness and banish evil. Legend says that only a true hero can wield it — any others would immediately die upon touching it. 

Some stories say the hero who stood against the hordes at the Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess bore this very blade, and further claim it was the only weapon capable of countering soulsteel. 

**Notes:**: Note that the reference to the hero's stand is indeed an actual historical event which took place around the year 508 of the Forsaken Era. The fall of the temple is widely regarded by historians as the symbolic and final end of the Old Kingdom. 

But a sword that destroys evil? How absurd. How could a sword tell the difference between good and evil? I hesitate to include this one, except for the reference to countering soulsteel. Now that I know magic is capable of curing bloodrage, perhaps this merits further investigation.

**Status:**: Many swords fitting the same general description were created by [[The Sovereignty]] with Hylia's aid, many many eons past. They were used to combat the forces of the void, and allowed the wielder to use [[Seal Entity]] on a magically bound and restrained enemy, or [[Annihilate Entity]] on a defeated one (without cost). One sword actually made it into this realm, and [[the Ancient Hero]] indeed used it to combat the Blin during a Blight. It's power is fueled directly by the Triforce. Only holders of the Triforce (or several fragments) may wield it. Anyone else attempting to would die due to their magic and life essence being consumed. It can indeed combat soulsteel.
