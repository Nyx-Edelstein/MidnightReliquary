## Description
**MP Cost**:
A small fixed cost, plus opposed cost from target

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Attempt to siphon from or transfer MP to a target. The target may attempt to resist, increasing the cost by expending their own magic. Those with higher affinities have an easier time resisting or forcing a transfer.

If the target being siphoned is subdued or does not resist, there is no opposed cost. Losing concentration will interrupt the effect.

## QM Data
**MP Cost**:
10 + (Opposed Cost Ã— Ratio of affinities between target and caster)

**Time Cost**:
Instant

**Description**:
Pay an upfront cost, and then siphon from or transfer MP to a target at a rate per second equal to the caster's affinity.

If the target being siphoned is subdued or does not resist, there is no opposed cost. Losing concentration will interrupt the effect.

Allows transfer of magic the user is not natively sensitive to, but this magic dissipates quickly and cannot be regenerated as normal.
