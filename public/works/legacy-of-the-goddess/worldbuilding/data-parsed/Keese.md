**About**:
Small, batlike creatures that hunt insectoids using echolocation, although they also subsist off of various fruits. They are surprisingly intelligent, and communicate amongst themselves to distract and confuse predators. Keese are mostly harmless, although they can be extremely territorial around their nests, and will attack if threatened.

Most species are nocturnal, though there are a few diurnal species in heavily wooded areas.
