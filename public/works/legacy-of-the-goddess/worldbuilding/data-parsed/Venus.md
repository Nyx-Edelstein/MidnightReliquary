## Description
### About

The self-proclaimed Queen of the [[Fae]]ries, Venus has a small presence bound to the largest island between the [[Plains of Ruin]] and the [[Eye of Din]]. Once a common stop for adventurers and would-be heroes seeking her boons (although at significant cost), she has not had an opportunity to grow her influence since the [[Blin]] invasion.
