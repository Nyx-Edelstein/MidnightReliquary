<span>Link dozed fitfully, rolling onto his right side as was his habit. It left his sword arm free and his other arm in a good position to push off the ground should he—<i>Pain</i>. He woke with a jerk, lightning shooting up and down through his not-quite-numb-enough shield arm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Groaning, he gave up on sleep and sat up, massaging at his aching muscles. Not just his thrice-damned right arm, but every part of him, it seemed, hurt in some way. He felt like he had been chewed up and spit out by a kodongo. No—actually, he was pretty sure that would be preferable. At least then it would just be a physical pain. He knew he needed more sleep, but if it wasn’t the pain keeping him awake it was the nausea, and if it wasn’t the nausea it was his racing thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wind picked up, and he shivered as he felt the temperature drop. He decided to forego further attempts at sleep in favor of huddling closer to the fire. If he had to be conscious then at least the fire’s warmth took the chill out of the cold night air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His clothing caught under him as he sat up, and yet again he was painfully reminded of his limp, useless shield arm. Link grit his teeth and groaned into the night. His entire body felt like it was made of hot lead, and yet was echoingly fragile at the same time. As if he had been stretched too thin, too taut, and now wasn’t able to bounce back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And he was so. Thoroughly. Exhausted. He wanted so badly to cry, but the tears wouldn’t come. And even if he could cry, what would that accomplish? What was the point?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gazed up at the stars and sagged under the immense weight of it all. Everything in the whole world—and every other world too, now—bore down on him. It was too much. It was all just too much. Everything was so much bigger than he ever thought possible.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Here he was—just some guy who fancied himself a hero. All alone in the middle of the desert with a useless arm. Desperate. Clinging to the barest threads of hope. No clue at all what he was doing. Bumbling from one place to the next, almost getting splatted by creatures of nightmare and fable that had no right to exist one day and getting psychically assaulted by <i>wrong-things</i> and possessed by ancient Gerudo ghost-kings the next. All the while resting his faith on the words of a probably-dead-but-maybe-not-quite-sure-yet goddess who for some reason thought any of this was a good idea.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Who was he now? His entire identity revolved around a single thing: his fighting prowess. He was nothing if not a warrior. A guardian. A protector. <i>The Queen’s Champion.</i> And now, at least until his arm healed—and the Goddesses only knew how long that would take—he was completely and utterly useless. Everything he was, stripped from him with a single cut.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was almost symbolic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link let out a bemused huff. Of course it was symbolic. Why wouldn’t it be? That was kind of exactly what it meant for it to be a “spiritual wound,” right?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Maybe he was thinking about it the wrong way. He took in a slow, measured breath, looking inside himself once more for inner strength. For courage to face the darkness that lay ahead. Immediately, Hylia’s words came to mind: “Have faith and you will be rewarded.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wanted to have faith. He wanted so badly to believe this was all part of a larger plan. And yet, Ibboso’s claims cast doubt in his mind. What if Hylia’s message wasn’t intended for him? What if the real hero had long since come and gone? Was his vision at the temple simply an echo from a long-forgotten time?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wanted anything but to believe that. Yet…</span>
<br><br>
<span>But, no. How could that be, when he <i>actually had</i> fulfilled his goddess-given mission? Through his actions, Ibboso had been freed! And his people… those things…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shuddered, putting the memories of them far, far from his mind. Ibboso’s tribe would move on in time. Or at least, Seff seemed to think so, and Link had to trust that Seff knew what he was talking about. The idea that Seff couldn’t be taken at his word… he didn’t even want to consider that possibility.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—And Seff! What was his deal? He spoke and acted as if he had been personally sent to save Link by Hylia herself! If Ibboso was right, then why in the name of all the gods and goddesses in the heavens above would the Holy Mother send <i>Seff</i> to save him if she wasn’t still somehow looking out for him?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everything pointed towards him being on the right path! And yet… something still ate at him. Seff knew Ibboso. They had been friends, once upon a time. Sure, Ibboso could’ve just said those things in an attempt to break Link’s resolve. But if he was being honest with himself, that didn’t feel right as an explanation. Not on a gut level. His instincts practically screamed at him that none of this was right, and Link had learned time and again to listen to his instincts. Ibboso didn’t seem like the type of man who would stoop to lying in order to get the upper hand in a fight. That flew in the face of everything he knew about the Gerudo and their sense of honor. And even if that weren’t the case—of all the things Ibboso could have said, this in particular was so specific—so directly targeted at him—that Link was unsure if any other utterance by that man could have caused him the same degree of unease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sat back, gazing up at the night sky once more. How many heroes had come and gone before him? How many of them had fallen—or worse, succeeded, only to have their work undone by time and then been cast to the wayside, forgotten by history? Link had sworn an oath to his kingdom, and he would give his life to protect it without hesitation. But what if…</span>
<br><br>
<span>What if it was all for nothing? What if every lineage of every stalwart knight and all the champions who ever lived, together with the divine might of the Mother Goddess herself wasn’t enough to turn the tides against Demise?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So do it anyway,” a soft whisper spoke in the night.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link started and sat upright, searching for the source of the voice. “Who’s there?!” he demanded. He clutched his sword, but…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing. No one. He was alone for miles, as far as he knew. Well, almost no one. He lifted his head to glance over to Grenja’s horse, resting cozily on the other side of the campfire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He frowned. Was his mind playing tricks on him? Was that… Telepathy? Or perhaps…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi?” Link called out into the night. “You there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no response. She hadn’t been around since he came back to himself during his run-in with Seff. He was starting to worry that his connection to her had been somehow damaged. That would make sense, given everything else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But if that were the case, he’d almost certainly have to make the trek back to Hyrule alone. He wasn’t looking forward to that. Not one bit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sighed. If nothing else, surely the team would be tracking him down by now? No way they’d have a hard time of it with this campfire going. Come to think of it, neither would bandits… But then again, not many of them were eager to travel at night. It was after all the easiest way to get caught unawares by a wandering kargarok. Or a pack of jackalbadgers, or a swarm of migrating dactos, or… uh…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link glanced around into the darkness again, then back Grenja’s horse. He had to wonder which of them would make for easier prey.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Best not to think about such things. If it came to it, he would do what he had to in order to survive. Simple as that. And with luck, it would be the team who found him first and not bandits or any other manner of creature or fiend.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With some effort, he shifted the bedroll an inch or two closer to the fire. Even if he wasn’t going to get any sleep tonight, it still felt good to close his eyes and rest. He just had to remind himself that the strings of the campfire needed to be plucked over the mountaintops before sunrise, or else he was going to have a hard time of it without enough arrows for breakfast in the morning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zzzzzzzzzz…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Last chance to join me,” the man who was not Link said. He smirked down at Ryn from atop Grenja’s horse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn glared up at the arrogant bastard. She clutched her sore chest, lying on her side in the sand and dirt as she tried to catch her breath. Thankfully, nothing felt broken.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t think you’re going to get away with this,” she said. She spat at his feet and wiped away a trail of blood from her busted lip.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso’s smirk turned into a sneer as he huffed. “Watch me.” He turned and pulled on the reins, and with a “Hyah!” the Ghost-King rode off into the desert.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Hey, you okay?” Koja asked, sounding worried.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn shook her head, snapping out of the reverie. “Yeah. I’m fine. Just…” she trailed off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was too easy to get lost in thought like this, watching their shadows bounce and jitter in the lantern light as their horses trotted along. It didn’t help that they were all well past exhausted.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Focus, Ryn,</i> she thought to herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The tracks were fresh. That was good. They were closing in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She found her mind wandering again. So much to process—she didn’t even know where to begin. Frustration and anger at herself for allowing any of it to happen in the first place. Bitterness and resentment at Ibboso for what he had done. And beneath it all, worry and barely-suppressed panic that they wouldn’t be able to… to get him back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ryn!” Koja said reproachfully. “You can’t keep thinking about those things. You said so yourself, the only power they have—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know!” she snapped. “I said I’m fine!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja cursed under her breath and turned away. Their horses continued to trot along, an uneasy silence falling between them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry,” Ryn muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja gave a shrug with a slight shake of her head, as if to say “don’t worry about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn grunted. “It’s not them I was thinking about anyway,” she offered. “It’s—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, I get it,” Koja interrupted. “You love him.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn felt a sickness and unease welling up in her stomach. How had she let herself get here? So ficking stupid. She knew letting herself get close would compromise her judgment—she just rationalized it away as not having to worry about that sort of thing with him. But now? If the worst came to worst and they had to fight Ibboso… could she really…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry, hun,” Koja said. “I know what you’re thinking. My advice? Don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yeah, she was probably right. Ryn looked to Koja and nodded, an understanding passing between them. The wind picked up and she pulled her cloak tight against the cold night air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think he’ll be okay?” Koja asked after a moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn narrowed her eyes in confusion, then followed Koja’s gaze ahead to her brother. She couldn’t hear him from this distance, but it looked like he was still muttering to himself—the same nonsense, over and over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He’s a tough guy, yeah?” Ryn said uneasily. “I’m sure he’ll pull through.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I hope so,” Koja said. “It’s just—I’ve never seen him like this before.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, to be fair…” Ryn started with a grin, holding up a finger. Koja preemptively waved her down, irritation showing on her face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn bit her lip. Yeah… maybe now wasn’t the best time to be cutting jokes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Maybe he just needs some time?” she tried instead. “Some distance. We’ll see how he is in a day or three.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja sighed, then nodded. “Here’s to hoping.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“AAAAAH!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link choked to wakefulness as he was jerked clean off the ground and held by his neck over the low flames of the dying fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“GIVE US BACK OUR LINK, YOU FICKING SCUMBAG GERUDO GHOST!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link struggled to breathe as he grasped at Grenja’s massive forearm with his one working hand, feet kicking helplessly beneath him. “—Me! It’s me, Grenja! It’s not… urrk!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The six-and-a-half foot tall Sheikah reared back and tossed him into the dirt. Link hit the ground with a thud. He scrambled, trying to get his feet under him, but Grenja was on top of him before he knew it, picking him up and repeatedly slamming him back into the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“GIVE. US. BACK. OUR. FRIEND!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s me, Grenja! It’s Link! I’m not Ibboso, I swear!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bro! Chill!” / “Grenja, cut it out!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja eased up, and Link caught his breath as the hulking maniac loomed over him. He looked noticeably out of sorts, with a haunted, sunken look on his face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do I know it’s really you?” Grenja demanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Urg…” Link sat up, clutching at his arm. If it hurt before, now it felt like it was on fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked between his teammates, his mind struggling to come up with an explanation. His vision swam, and he blinked back tears. “Sorry, just uhm… I’ve been through a lot lately and I’m kind of out of it still, and—Aaaaaaaaaah!!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link slammed back into the ground as Ryn landed on top of him, squeezing him in a firm and very painful embrace. “You ficking idiot!” she said. “I thought we lost you!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aaaaaaahaha. Ha. Aaaaaaah,” Link moaned, half-laughing and half-crying as he tried to push through the pain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, sorry. You okay?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Noooo.</i> Very much no,” Link said, clamping down on the worst of it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn pulled back, and Grenja stalked away. Koja strode over and knelt beside him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Something happen to your arm? Let me see—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No!! No, no, no. Please don’t,” Link said in a hurry. “Whatever you do, don’t Heal it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja leaned away and eyed him, clearly befuddled and a mite suspicious. She glanced to Ryn. Grenja wheeled about and began stalking back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeeeaah. Guys, listen. About that,” Link said, rubbing his arm again with a sigh. “I guess we should debrief sooner rather than later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much for getting any sleep tonight.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After a long and very confused conversation, Link confirmed that the others had—if not the same experience—very similar experiences to him. Strange lapses in memory, with dreamlike jumps of logic that felt wholly convincing in the moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Their recollections varied, but the core of it was the same. They met Urik at the pass, saw him possessed by an otherworldly presence, then travelled with him to the village. There, they encountered a bunch of not-exactly-people, were psychically assailed with nightmarish visions and unpleasant memories, and then were stuck in the house for a while until Urik came back and left with Link and Ryn to treat with Ibboso.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn had the easiest time of it, having figured out she could break the illusions by Scrying. Unfortunately, something about being caught up in the illusions prevented her from sharing anything with the others until it was too late. Her own memory of events concorded with Link’s; however, she claimed to have blacked out while talking with Ibboso. She woke up some time later in front of a dusty sepulcher, just in time for a run-in with a certain someone who was in the process of making off with Link’s body. She said she couldn’t recall Ibboso’s fight with Link. She only remembered going back for Grenja and Koja, and practically dragging them out of the village, through the pass and back to safety.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja refused to speak about what happened after they left, and Koja was still shaken up. Apparently Urik’s protections on the “house” only held up until roughly the point that he was locked away by Ibboso. Link could only imagine what horrors they experienced when the protections faded. He tried very hard not to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The siblings were clearly traumatized by the events, with Grenja being by far the worse off. He wasn’t able to get much out of either of them, and Link decided it was best not to press. They had made it out in one piece, and he counted that as a blessing. Chalk another point up for Seff being inexplicably right about things.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What’s more, they owed their lives to Ryn. Link considered himself doubly fortunate to have such an amazing person by his side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>After giving the team a quick run-down of his encounter with Seff—and assuring them over and over that no, he had not hit his head, and no, it hadn’t been the illusions, and no, it wasn’t a dream—they decided to retreat to a more defensible location and set up camp for some much-needed rest.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ryn flew a few feet above the ground over a barren landscape, white and snowy. Mountains rose and undulated in the distance, and grey clouds blotted out the sun overhead. Beneath her, her own reflection stared back up from the mirror polish of a massive, frozen-over lake, stretching out into the distance in every direction.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except, as she studied it, she saw it was not her reflection. It had her shape, her body, her features—but it was dark and shadowy, with empty, white eyes. She blinked hard, and her perspective shifted. The image clarified, and it seemed that it was in fact her reflection after all. But wait… no…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fear rose in her chest as she realized she was on the wrong side of the frozen-over surface. Icy cold water flowed around her, chilling her to the bone and sapping her energy. She swam up to the ice and pounded against it with every ounce of her strength—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—But stopped abruptly as she saw her reflection do the same. Her doppelgänger perfectly mirrored her every movement. Her <i>reflection</i>? The “her” on the other side of the…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She blinked. Another perspective shift. This time she was above the lake, resting on her knees, looking down into its depths. Now there was no reflection. Nothing at all under its surface. Just cold, still—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Ryn awoke with a start as a blood-curdling scream sounded out in the camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja!</span>
<br><br>
<span>She wasted no time. With knife in hand, she rushed through the morning twilight and cut her way into the siblings’ tent. There, she found Koja gripping her bedroll with white knuckles, breathing heavily. Grenja knelt on the opposite side in the corner, hunched over and facing away. Still that haunted, sunken look on his face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Slowly, she edged up and took Koja’s hand. “Koja? What’s wrong?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja blinked through tears and took a long, calming breath. “Just a dream,” she said. “It was just a dream. Everything’s… okay. Everything’s going to be okay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn looked between her and her brother. Grenja was muttering under his breath again. Still hunched over in the corner. Still facing away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s all my fault. I did this. I should’ve been stronger. She didn’t have to see. It’s all my fault. I did this…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn shook her head slowly. No. This was anything but okay.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey Grenj?” she said. “It’s about time someone went scouting again. Mind coming with?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” came his response. Dull, listless. He stood and left the tent without another word.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn looked back to Koja. An understanding passed between them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look out for Link while I’m gone? Make sure he’s okay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja nodded. Reluctantly, Ryn went after Grenja.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Their horses trudged along as the sky brightened and the sun broke out over the peaks of the eastern mountain range. Ryn did her part, scrying every now and again as the pair of them patrolled a few kilometers from the perimeter of camp, with Grenja keeping watch. It was more of a formality than anything. They hadn’t encountered any bandits this close to the haunted pass, and likely wouldn’t for another day or two.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Practicalities aside, she had also gotten into the habit of scrying occasionally throughout the day on the off chance there was more illusion fickery to deal with. Thus far, they had been fortunate not to run into it again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn glanced over to Grenja. Still that faraway look, like he wasn’t all there. Now was as good a time as any.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a breath, she nudged her horse into a canter and caught up beside him. She tried to meet his eyes, but he only stared off ahead, far into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We left them there,” he said lifelessly. “We just up and left.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn couldn’t think of anything to say. She knew the illusions were strong, and took a deep hold in the mind. She wasn’t sure if she should engage with him, or try and reason with him, or—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’M NOT CRAZY,” he yelled. Ryn withdrew, taken aback.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… never said you were,” she responded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you’re thinking it,” Grenja said. “You’re all thinking it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen. Those kids weren’t <i>real</i>, Grenja,” Ryn said. “They were just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know that, Ryn!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Tense silence. Ryn studied his face, shaking her head minutely. This needed to be handled delicately. Far more delicately than anything she was capable of.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But Grenja didn’t have anyone else. Koja had her own problems, and Link…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not crazy, Ryn,” Grenja repeated. “I know what I saw. I know what they were, and they <i>weren’t</i> just illusions. They were…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “I don’t know what they were, exactly, but I know they weren’t supposed to be here. It’s like… It’s like they got caught between this place and the next, and their souls haven’t been able to escape for all this time. They’ve been trapped here, forced to relive the worst moments of their lives and their worst fears over and over and over for <i>hundreds</i> of years…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn rode along him silently, waiting for him to continue. She dared not interrupt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They told me…” he said quietly, “they told me they hid during the attack. The adults said everything would be fine if they hid away. And they did. Through all the fighting, through all the bloodshed… they did.” Tears streamed down his face. “And when everyone else was gone, they came out. They grieved for all they lost, but they were still alive. For a while. Until they ran out of food, and no one came for them, and… and…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn looked down to Grenja’s bloodied and bandaged left hand with dawning horror. Three and a half fingers missing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I just wanted to help them, Ryn,” Grenja said softly. “I just wanted… but it’s all my fault… I should’ve been stronger. Koja didn’t have to see. It’s my fault… I should’ve been stronger…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja! Snap out of it!” Ryn said. “No matter what happened, no matter what you saw—no matter what <i>Koja</i> saw, you can’t keep doing this to yourself!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The broken man looked back at her, face sunken and hollow. A long, long silence stretched between them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought. Ryn silently prayed to the Goddess Above that it was the right thing to say.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know, Link said… well, from Seff anyway. Probably… they’ll move on, or something, before too long.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She cursed herself. Why couldn’t she ever find the right words in times like these? She looked over to her teammate. Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn reached over, placing a hand on his back. “Look, it’s not—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja grunted and kicked his horse into a trot, putting distance between them as he rode ahead. Not towards camp, just ahead. Ryn reluctantly followed behind.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link awoke sometime late the next morning to the smell of cooking meat. He found his arm wrapped up tightly in a sling, with ample padding. That helped a great deal with the pain; it wasn’t nearly as bad when he didn’t move it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took in the surroundings. They had taken shelter last night under an overhang near the mountains. Looking out over the plains, he judged from the length of the shadows that it was an hour or two before noon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How’s the arm?” Koja asked, stitching together some fabric to repair one of the tents as she sat atop a mat a few paces away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Better,” Link answered. “Or, well—it doesn’t hurt as much.” He grunted. “Thanks.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“’s what I’m here for,” Koja said with a thin smile. She followed his gaze to the smoldering embers of the campfire, and the pot above it. “Hungry?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goddesses, yes,” Link said. His stomach growled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja stood and retrieved a bowl for him. “Crispy fried Aracha,” she said, passing the bowl his way. “Still warm. I think. Did what I could with seasoning, although there’s not much out here, sadly. Some redreed root. And the last of the peppercorn.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not gonna hear me complain,” Link said. “I’d eat just about anything right now.” Almost anything. In the field, you had to make do with what you could find. Still, that didn’t mean he was eager to try Octorok again anytime soon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hesitantly, he stuffed his mouth with a crunchy bite, then chewed and swallowed. It was a bit spicy, with a peculiar though not unpleasant aftertaste. “Not bad,” he said, surprised.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja sat back at her mat and continued to work. “Ryn and Grenja are out scouting, by the way,” she said. “They’re due back any minute now. A couple hours, tops.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded. He waited for more, but she had nothing else to say. He could tell she was still out of it. It was rare for her to be so reserved. As much as he wanted to help and be supportive, he also knew he wasn’t the best person for that sort of thing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He decided to let her work in silence as he finished his meal.</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span>The sun passed overhead, then off to the west as shadows grew longer. Link passed the time by looking back over the translations of the books taken from the spire. It was difficult and frustrating using only one arm, but he managed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To his consternation, Fi still had not made contact. There was no telling what was happening back in Hyrule, and they were another three or four days before they were in range of Last Bastion. He could only imagine what Zelda and the others thought. He hoped they weren’t too worried.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja had long since finished patching up the tarp and was lying on her back, staring up at the crags. Link supposed now was as good a time as any to ask…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, Koja?” he said, getting her attention. “I don’t suppose you know anything about spiritual wounds?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry, no,” she replied. “Theory isn’t my specialty. I’m more of a practical kind of gal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded to himself, leaving it at that. He’d have to ask elsewhere once they got back to Hyrule.</span>
<br><br>
<span>More time passed. Just as he began to grow concerned, Ryn and Grenja rode up. Ryn dismounted right away and made a beeline for camp while Grenja tended to the horses.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oy, Captain Sleepyhead!” Ryn called out. “Permission to come aboard?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, granted?” Link called back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t encourage her,” Koja said with a groan, sitting up. She turned to Ryn. “So? How is he?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The women exchanged glances. Ryn pursed her lips and shook her head minutely. Koja plopped back down without another word. Ryn took a seat at Link’s side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja?” Link asked curiously. “Is he okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about him,” Ryn said. “He’s a tough guy. He’ll pull through. Say, Link, have you heard from Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No.” Link sighed. “I’m not sure what’s up with that. Probably has to do with the… you know.” He gestured towards the sling over his right arm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn nodded. “Well. All the more reason to double-time it to Last Bastion,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link winced. “About that. I was thinking—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So help me, if you even <i>think</i> about suggesting we head back there—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link put his hands up. Or one of them, anyway. “No, not that. Just, uh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Come to think of it, how were they supposed to power the stone tablet without Fi? He scratched his head. “You know that ping we got from the tablet before we headed over to the pass?” he asked. “Well… uh…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Both Ryn and Koja glared daggers in his general direction.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link deflated. “You know, maybe we should just count ourselves lucky and head back,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The women nodded in unison. Link supposed they could come back later, if need be.</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span>Night fell over the camp once more. They had been through so much, and everyone agreed it was best to delay forward progress for now, so that they would all be well-rested and prepared for the journey ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn laid on her back in her shared tent with Link. He dozed soundly at her side. She grinned to herself. After the workout she had just given him, she expected nothing less.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her hands went idly to the jade pendant around her neck. Her own, precious treasure. Where had the item come from? The goddesses only knew. She found it on her person shortly after the run-in with Ibboso.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She rubbed a thumb over its crystalline facets, admiring it with a mixture of glee and awe. It was the oddest thing; no matter how she held it to her eye, she could not see her own reflection in its gem.</span>
