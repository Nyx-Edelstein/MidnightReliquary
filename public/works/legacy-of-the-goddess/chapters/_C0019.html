<span>Zelda sat at a small table in a makeshift war room. Laylith, Izu, Naibi and Shesan sat with her, while Malg stood off to the side, leaning against a stack of crates. They were the better part of a days’ ride past Last Bastion. Another day and the Sunseeker regiment would part ways, leaving the rest of the caravan to continue on to Castletown. Good timing on Link’s part.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda was ecstatic that he and his party had found as much as they had on the mission to the Obsidian Spire, but one thing in particular about the discoveries bothered her.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Stalfos.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>What kind of world did they live in, where fighting the reanimated bodies of the dead was an actual consideration to be dealt with? Zelda never really gave those stories much thought—she just assumed it was part of how things were back when magic was more prevalent in the world. Back when Hylia was still around. Unbelievable as it was, the Lightsworn existed for a reason, after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She found herself fidgeting, and clasped her hands on the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In light of Link’s findings, I am… <i>concerned</i>,” she said to those gathered before her. “About the possibility that Demise may be able to raise the dead to fight against us. In my dreams…”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>The slow, inexorable march of a thousand skeletal warriors. Eyes burning with unholy fire, shields raised—barring her path, pushing her nearer and nearer the cliff…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She shook her head, pushing the vision aside. “I find it troubling that my dreams have at times featured <i>Stalfos</i>. And not just Stalfos—in several of them I have seen the reanimated dead. My own mother and father’s wailing corpses. Fishermen with rotting flesh and worms crawling from their skulls. Dead bodies washing ashore and rising up…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>At her side, Laylith gently touched her arm. Zelda took a calming breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do we know what is being done with the bodies of slain Blin?” Zelda asked. “…Slain Hylians?” She shuddered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu cleared his throat from across the table. “Yes, actually. The bodies of the Blin are piled up in ditches and burned, then buried. I never really thought about <i>why</i> that was done—I just assumed it was about efficiency—but it is standard procedure. Part of the old ways, handed down in the codebooks since time immemorial.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And Hylians?” Zelda said anxiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pyres, usually. When we can recover the body.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Does burning the remains prevent the skeletons from being reanimated?” Laylith asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everyone looked to Shesan. The woman rolled a hand outward, as if to say “Who knows?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That being part of your ancient traditions suggests it does,” Shesan said. “I can’t say—but really, it isn’t the skeletons you have to worry about. Voidspawn <i>themselves</i> are dangerous, and while the specifics of how their influence manifests in the physical plane varies substantially from place to place, Voidspawn in general are capable of nearly anything. You don’t have to look any further than Ja’bu’s corrupting influence on the Zora to see that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She leaned in, meeting each of their eyes in turn, her voice drawing to a whisper. “Voidspawn <i>feed off of the darkness and fear in people’s minds</i>, warping and twisting those they sink their claws into, manipulating them to their own devious ends. They are whatever you fear they are. They are capable of whatever you believe them to be. The bodies of the deceased may conveniently provide a physical form that allows them to act directly, but powerful Voidspawn—or simply large numbers of them—are plenty dangerous all on their own.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A cold chill crawled up Zelda’s spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s all well and good,” Izu said. “But how do we fight them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “With luck, we won’t have to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Luck,” Laylith said flatly. “Really?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Shesan said matter-of-factly. “<i>Luck.</i> We can’t prepare for every eventuality, and at some point you have to make the determination of when not to expend resources chasing down improbabilities. Aside from Ja’bu, the only Voidspawn we’ve encountered were sealed away in an ancient Lightsworn structure—and those were likely nothing more than remnants of the Dark One’s influence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>The Dark One</i>? Zelda was about to raise the question, but Shesan caught her eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Oh, right. Naibi was sitting right next to her. Zelda bit her lip and looked away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan continued. “The presence of Voidspawn there heavily suggests there may be more sealed away at the other locations in Link’s visions. Make no mistake, it is a threat we need to be wary of—especially if Ganondorf beats us there and finds some way to free them—but if Demise were capable of unleashing Voidspawn on the world all on his own, he’d have done so by now. Probably.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Probably?</i>” Zelda said. It was her turn to be skeptical.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan sighed. “Yes, well, I would be lying if I said it didn’t bother me too—your legends and stories establish worrying precedent. What’s fact and what’s fiction is anyone’s guess, but taken as a whole, the evidence is compelling: Voidspawn have in the past been used as agents of the enemy. Regardless, the fact that Demise <i>in these times</i> has had to resort to working through Ganondorf alone, and that Ganondorf’s actions have been constrained to mustering mortal armies and unsealing ancient evils, implies Demise is not capable of acting directly in that manner. For now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She held up a hand, preempting Laylith’s objection. “No, I cannot say for certain—he may well just be holding out for a more opportune time, or even working his way towards restoring lost powers. In my estimation that is unlikely at best, and even then it isn’t the most pertinent threat we face. Need I remind you that Ganondorf has at least five fragments of power?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still no word back from the Goron expedition, by the by,” Izu said indolently. “Nor the other teams sent to rendezvous with Vesyrn and Golvara.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do we know what his next move will be?” Malg said from off to the side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Awakening more ancient evils is my bet,” Naibi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The table fell silent. Zelda felt a mixture of nerves and a sickness in her stomach. She really didn’t like not knowing, when so much was at stake. They knew Demise was after the Triforce, but beyond that?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She furrowed her brow. Come to think of it, why had there been so much activity with the Triforce recently? The fragments had been lost for ages, yet her dreams were now seemingly showing her their locations. The dreams had not done that before the Blight. And where had Shesan gotten her information about the fragments in the Plains of Ruin?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was the Triforce “waking up” in response to current events? Or perhaps something specific had happened to trigger it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her thoughts fell to Father’s fragment, now in Shesan’s possession. She hadn’t told Zelda of its location—likely keeping it hidden intentionally. Zelda agreed in the abstract that fewer people knowing its whereabouts was a good idea. Still, she wasn’t entirely sold on Shesan’s ability to keep it safe. Zelda knew almost nothing about her or her capabilities. Did Vesyrn have it? Did she have it? Naibi? Or was it being held by some hitherto unknown agent?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan met her eyes, and Zelda looked away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is there something I should know about?” Shesan said suspiciously. “Something you’re not telling me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grit her teeth, feeling a pang of anger and frustration. She let it go. “Not really,” she said, as cordially as she could manage. “Just thinking. There’s so much we don’t know about it. The Triforce, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan narrowed her eyes. Zelda felt uneasy. Should she press?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Might as well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan, are you certain my father’s fragment is safe?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She scoffed. “Not even remotely.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you said—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—If you recall, what I said was ‘it is as safe as it can be.’ I harbor no illusions it will find its way to Ganondorf the moment it comes into contact with him. It’s out of his hands for now. That’s all I can say. My <i>singular</i> hope is that we can buy enough time to find the other fragments before that comes to pass.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What if we were to find someone else it would bind more strongly to?” Zelda ventured.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan raised an eyebrow. “As I said, I’m open to the possibility. Do you have someone in mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt a sick taste in her mouth, but she had to voice the thought. If there were any chance it could help…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took in a deep breath, paused, and composed her thoughts. “There is a man on my council—Prime Counselor Taetus. Commonborn, though he is <i>undoubtedly</i> the most ambitious person I know. For better or worse, he worked his way up from the gutters to become one of the wealthiest and most influential men in my kingdom. He’s been elected to his position by his peers for the past twelve years, and since Father’s passing, has been absolutely <i>relentless</i> in hamstringing me at every opportunity in pursuit of his own selfish goals. He makes a big show of being concerned ‘for the people,’ but that doesn’t stop him from lining his own pockets at every opportunity, and all-but spitting in the face of the nobility every time he gets the chance. Don’t get me wrong—he has his uses. He’s second-to-none at his craft, and <i>someone</i> has to do the job. His type is usually easy to deal with, but this man simply doesn’t know his place! I charged him with forestalling the famine in Castletown, and the very next day he’s confiscating all the rupees in town and flogging nobles in the streets just to make a point!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>To her side, Laylith cleared her throat. Zelda blushed and ran her hands over her face. She might have gotten a little carried away in trying to make her point.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anyway,” she said, brushing the tirade aside. “If Wisdom binds to something like <i>idealism</i> and Courage binds to something like <i>selflessness</i>, then perhaps Power binds to something like <i>ambition</i>? There has to be a reason the fragments have traditionally been held by kings and conquerors. Naibi, is it fair to say that Ganondorf was a particularly ambitious king?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fair to say, yes,” Naibi said, not missing a beat. “Uniting the tribes was no small feat, yet the sheer determination of the King Among Kings inspired intense loyalty in his followers. With any other man, it would not have been possible.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” Malg said, coming to stand at the table. “Do you mean to say you believe Power would bind more strongly to <i>Counselor Taetus</i> than to Ganondorf?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda had to stifle a laugh. “No, not at all,” she corrected. “I’m only putting forward the possibility that it may be safer in his hands than wherever else it is presently.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan eyed her. Zelda returned her gaze, crossing her arms. “What? You think I’m wrong?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I’m not saying you’re <i>wrong</i>,” Shesan replied, “but you are making certain assumptions. We don’t know whether how strongly a fragment resonates with its current owner matters when it decides someone else is more worthy of holding it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I concede that much,” Zelda said smugly, “but even you have to admit it merits testing, no?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan hesitated. “I… can’t say. If you’re right, then yes, absolutely. But if you’re wrong, then we increase our exposure. It isn’t without risk, and it’s difficult to weigh the balance.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s an easy one,” Laylith said, coming to Zelda’s defense. “How can we reduce our exposure?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan stood, wrapping her hands around the back of her head and pacing from side to side. A moment later, she let out a breath and turned sharply. “I don’t know this man, but from your description he does seem like a plausible candidate. How about this—arrange a meeting, and I’ll see for myself. Afterwards, I’ll give you my assessment and we can determine how to proceed from there. Does that work for you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Sounds sensible enough.” She picked up her quill and made a note. “—Oh, so that means you’re coming back to Castletown rather than going with Naibi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That seems to be the case, yes,” Shesan said, returning to her seat. “Will that be a problem?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No problem at all,” Zelda said. The castle was big enough she wouldn’t have to set eyes on the woman if she didn¹t need to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked over her notes. “Last item of business for now. Naibi, Shesan: do either of you know anything about a man named ‘Ibboso’ or his tribe? Supposedly he was a Gerudo king who died long ago. Link is looking for the location of his burial site.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi boggled at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh—sorry,” Zelda said hastily. “Is this one of the ‘we don’t talk about it’ things?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Naibi said, waving a hand. “Nothing of the sort. I find it curious—that is all. The story of Ibboso the Damned is a tale told to wayward children. Nothing more. Why would such a thing interest you, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It was part of Link’s vision,” Zelda said, “When he ascended to the top of the spire. In the vision, an echo of the Goddess Hylia charged him with putting Iboso and his tribe to rest. There may be a fragment of Courage involved.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi whistled. “Such strange times, when we find stories and fables to be true.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you tell me about these stories?” Zelda asked eagerly, dipping a quill to ink.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is not much to this one, sadly,” Naibi said. “Ibboso was said to be an arrogant king, who renounced the Gerudo way and violated the old laws. He offered refuge to the lost sons of other tribes—ꡦꡟꡛꡀꡲꡀꡟꡟꡖꡨ—those who were exiled for the crime of weakness. This angered the gods, and his tribe was cursed to roam the dry sands for eternity, never knowing the peace of death.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The <i>crime of weakness</i>?” Zelda said in disbelief. It was painfully obvious to her that “the gods” in this tale referred to Morudo Geira in some capacity, but she wasn’t about to mention that in front of Naibi.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We no longer follow the old laws,” Naibi said simply. “Please, let us not speak any more of this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded solemnly. “My mistake. Naibi, in Link’s vision, there was a mausoleum in the middle of a graveyard filled with shambling corpses. He said he had a vague feeling it was somewhere to the east, but he doesn’t know exactly where it is. You wouldn’t happen to know where to find that, would you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh,” she waved a hand from side to side. “There is a certain pass in the eastern mountains where no one goes. It is said that it was once a place of ritual and worship, but is now haunted. I never put stock in such tales, but if what you say is true, perhaps the dead really do roam there. I cannot say if it is the same place as his vision, but I also do not know where else it might be. There are not many such tales.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But do you know where it is?” Zelda asked anxiously. “Can you point it out on a map?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, but I expect some in the caravan might know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wonderful!” Zelda said, rising to her feet. “Let’s take care of that right away—Link and his team are waiting for the information. Thank you all—that’s all for now.”</span>

    <span>On Fi, Old Magic, Chromatic Magic, and Magical Artifacts</span>
</div>
<br>
<span><b>Note:</b> The first of these entries are a compilation of disparate notes recorded separately until the 34th of Last Brisk, Year 548 of the Common Era. Subsequent entries appended thereafter.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>35th of First Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>There is so much I do not understand about Fi. She’s quite the peculiar creature. I would have thought that being the Emissary of the Goddess Hylia, she would know more than she does. However, Hylia’s death seems to have adversely affected her somehow. I have inquired at length about ways to restore her memories and lost abilities, but I am wholly unable to understand her responses most of the time. So frustrating.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Telepathy and Compel—these abilities in particular seem likely to be useful in the future, though at present I struggle to find any immediate applications.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unlike Blue magic, her Telepathy is not limited by range. For now she is relegated to acting only in my vicinity, and further, communicating with anyone besides me—anyone who does not bear Hylia’s Mark—is prohibitively expensive. Still—reliable, instantaneous communication at arbitrary distances opens up quite a few possibilities.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Use of Compel on enemies seems straightforward enough, though again, we don’t have enough Divine Power to use it liberally. I would love to test it further and better understand its limits once we’ve stored enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Of particular interest is Hylia’s Mark—or more precisely, <i>Mark of Transference</i>. By Fi’s descriptions, these marks are intimately tied with Fi herself. From what little I’ve gleaned from her nigh-inscrutable responses, Hylia’s mark somehow <i>transmutes</i> my own residual magic and life energies into a form usable by her. Indeed, it seems these energies are the very same as her own “Divine Power.” She’s literally made of the stuff!</span>
<br><br>
<span>…So pretty.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thus far I am dissatisfied with the rate at which we are accumulating Divine Power. In order to build up the reserve to practically useful levels, it will be necessary to mark others besides just me. Fi says we can only have three “active” marks; marks which allow her to act and communicate directly. “Passive” ones will still generate Divine Power—just at a much lesser rate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Arlinkar is a natural first choice. Fi says that “acting as befits a Champion of Hylia” generates more Divine Power. Is there anyone alive in the kingdom today more heroic than <i>The Hero of Castletown?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>My very first thought after Fi described the Mark of Transference in more detail was to see if we could develop a variant that would require less of an initial investment, and which would only have the “transference” property—ignoring or bypassing all other complications and constraints. Unfortunately, she is very confident this will not be possible. She says the process involves altering one’s “spiritual essence” to cause “cascading resonance” with … <i>something</i>, and that barring developing an entirely new approach, it is essentially all-or-nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I suppose we’ll just have to mark Arlinkar, and then figure out where to go from there.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>2nd of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Following my research into legends and arcana, I asked Fi if the example of the Cane of Byrna would be enough for her to develop, recover, or otherwise reverse-engineer similar Old Magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Don’t ask me—I have no idea how she does anything. She doesn’t even have arms!)</span>
<br><br>
<span>As per the stories, the cane has three abilities: (1) Repelling Magic, (2) Invigoration of its wielder, and (3) Protection from all harm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi is very confident that repelling magic is not in any way related to Old Magic, as the chromatic magics do not interact directly with hers. A useful insight, I suppose. I will have to keep it in mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She has not ruled out the possibility of the protection effect being replicable, but at present she is unaware of any mechanisms by which it would work. She told me it would likely require somewhere between ten and a thousand times more Divine Power than we currently have—and that much just to give me a definitive answer! Eek. Probably best to put this one aside for now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fortunately, she does think the physical reinvigoration effect may be possible to replicate. I didn’t understand much of what she said when I asked, but it’s somehow related to <i>spiritual essences</i>. If she can observe me while I’m rested and while I’m tired, she might be able to work out a way to use Divine Power to isolate and reverse the relevant changes to my essence, thus in effect restoring stamina.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She estimates it will require an additional 700 to 1300 "units" worth of Divine Power for her to complete testing. Certainly more than we can spare right now, but it doesn’t seem all that much in the grand scheme. She also cautions that it may have adverse effects on metabolism, but that seems like a small price to pay for such a valuable ability. I can’t wait to try it!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Additional notes from my session with her earlier today:</span>
<br><br>
<span>She advises me that having an actual, functional example of magical application to work from would considerably reduce the amount of Divine Power she needs to research new abilities or recover old ones. This makes plenty of sense, but I’m not sure where exactly I’m supposed to get Old Magic artifacts. It’s not like we just have a pile of them lying around in the basement…</span>
<br><br>
<span>I asked about using fragments of the Triforce as a basis, but apparently replicating or altering their functions was well beyond even Hylia’s ability. Too bad.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, also the fragments can’t be suffused with Divine Power. That was one of the first things I had her try. Figures, since it doesn’t work with Imbue either.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi has cautioned me several times not to be too optimistic about magical research. I had many, many ideas to try, but she insists that there is a fundamental distinction between Old Magic and the chromatic magics, that feats possible through one may be impossible with the other, and that the two will not directly interact. Again, it all makes sense. Still, I can’t help but feel like a child in a candy-shop. There’s an entirely new type of magic here that no one else knows about! Surely there’s a plethora of novel applications just waiting to be discovered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I suppose we’ll just have to wait until we’ve stored up enough Divine Power for more research. Fi won’t even answer me right now because I’ve entirely exhausted the budget.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>4th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Prior to interrogating the Sheikah, I checked with Fi to see if Compel would allow her to force someone to answer questions honestly. She said she isn’t aware of any limitations that would prevent the ability from being used in that capacity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>However, given that she doesn’t actually know how much Divine Power it would take to try, I am of the mind to wait until after the first round of interrogations to decide whether or not to employ this particular strategy. It may prove unnecessary, as I have discovered she is capable of sensing when people are telling the truth versus making some attempt at deception or manipulation. Doing so only requires Telepathy or an Intangible Avatar.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A most useful ability, to be sure. Never again shall any duplicitous scheming catch me unawares! Muahahaha.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>5th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Following the attempt on my life, I am of the mind to mark Link as soon as possible. We still don’t know exactly how much Divine Power it will require, but Fi says that should we try with an insufficient amount and fail, it would give her a more precise estimate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She says the full attempt will require approximately one day of uninterrupted concentration on her part. I’ll have to find some suitable excuse to keep his company for that long which doesn’t raise suspicion—I simply can’t let these rumors about us get out of hand!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fortunately the initial test will only take an hour at most. We’ll see how it goes.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>Update:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>We used 100 units of Divine Power attempting to mark Link. Predictably this was unsuccessful, though Fi now estimates the total needed to be between 1550 and 8000 units. Her upper estimate is nearly five times more than we have at present, but another week or two and we should be close to the midpoint. I’ll have to budget more carefully.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>7th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>On a whim, I asked Fi to use a minimal amount of Divine Power to further her research on the physical reinvigoration effect. Somewhat predictably, she made no progress and her estimates did not change. Not sure why I bothered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I also asked her about replicating the Lens of Truth, again from my research. She said she would “not be able to do so in any meaningful capacity” without more information or without an example to work from.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Where am I supposed to get a Lens of Truth??</span>
<br><br>
<span>For now, we’ll just keep saving up to mark Link.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>15th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I asked Fi if she was able to learn anything of the scepter before it was destroyed. I still hate myself for having been so careless. We could have learned so much!</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi believes the scepter was designed as a conduit to channel Divine Power for some purpose related to Niesis’ stasis, with the opal acting as a focus. By Vestele’s account, the scepter was capable of imprisoning, sealing away, or possibly destroying Voidspawn or other entities tainted by the Void. However; when it made contact with Niesis, the stored energies were discharged instantly to destructive effect. As the opal also shattered on contact, she posits its destruction was “likely an unintended failure and not an intentional design feature.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No kidding?! Mother Above—Fi is so incredibly smart and insightful at times, and yet completely and totally oblivious at others. I don’t get it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At least she managed to recover a good chunk of Divine Power from the ordeal. Apparently Niesis had lots of the stuff, and we now have more than enough to mark Link. I’m going to have her get on that, just as soon as the nurse lets me out of this bed.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>20th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I asked Fi about the silvery egg from the temple, and if she was able to learn anything about it before or during the ritual. Could we perhaps make another one?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She says she wasn’t able to learn much about the artifact itself, and that her role was merely to activate it. However, she confirmed there were significant changes to Link’s essence as a result, but no additional changes since. She isn’t sure how these changes will manifest or what effects they may have on him. We’ll just have to wait and see.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I’ve directed her to keep an eye out and let me know if any more changes occur, and to use any and all Divine Power necessary in her observations. We can’t afford to miss anything.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I also asked if she would be able to replicate what happened with Link, and just make the same change in others without having to have another silvery egg. I didn’t get much from her response, but from what I can work out, it sounds like the change was specific to his essence alone, and that trying to make the same change to anyone else would almost certainly result in their death. Or worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Maybe we can capture some Blin to test it on? It would be great if we could churn out Lightsworn on demand. I certainly wouldn’t lose any sleep over it.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>26th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I completely forgot we have the stone tablet. That counts as a magic artifact, right?</span>
<br><br>
<span>I asked Fi to look into it today. We’ll see what she comes back with.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>27th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>As per my instruction, Fi used 100 units of Divine Power looking into the tablet. She doesn’t believe she can reverse engineer its area detection effect for herself without first finding another source that would cause it to trigger. Of course, I should have realized that sooner.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Good news though: simply having the artifact on hand for her to charge and observe as it discharges has given her insight into developing a more efficient way to identify Old Magic. She’s already capable of doing this by—I suspect—a way analogous to how mages detect magically imbued objects. That is, she attempts to suffuse it with Divine Power and then feels if the object resists or responds.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(I’m far from certain on that. Making out anything she says is often difficult, to say the least. She did however say my hypothesis was “not entirely wrong.” Hmph.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Anyway. She believes she can refine her approach to use approximately 50 times less Divine Power in the process of identifying dormant artifacts or other sources of Old Magic. She estimates somewhere between 575 and 950 Divine Power would be sufficient to perfect this new approach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That certainly sounds useful, but I’m not sold on the merits just yet. Judging by the results from the Temple of Time, it isn’t all that expensive for her as is. I’ve no doubt it will save us in the long run should we make it a habit of stumbling upon long-forgotten caches of ancient artifacts, but in lieu of that, it’s probably best to put this project off for now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Oh, one more thing! I noticed that when Link saved Burdah from the Kodongo he generated a good bit more Divine Power than normal—or at least, Fi reported more for that day than I expected. I asked her about this, but she <i>insists</i> that “there isn’t enough data to support relying on a singular conclusion,” and that “due to the close temporal proximity of the event to others, she is unable to rule out alternate explanations.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seriously, Fi? Come on! What else could it be?</span>
<br><br>
<span>I <i>have</i> to figure out how to exploit this. Link won’t go for it though if it means putting anyone in danger, no matter how many precautions we take. Whatever I do, I’ll need to be careful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hrm…</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>29th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I had an interesting idea I hoped would bear fruit. Fi can restore our magic, and Siphon is a thing, so shouldn’t we be able to reverse the process and store excess magic with Fi? She could then reverse her conversions, and we would have excess Divine Power as a result.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to work; her avatar can’t be affected by Siphon. Both I and Cove tried, but neither of us felt any magic to pull from. I asked if she might be able to figure out some way to Siphon magic directly from us herself. She said she was unwilling to try as it posed substantial danger to the test subject. I’m not sure if we should proceed. Perhaps if we can capture some fiends to test on first? But finding some with magical affinity might be tricky. Maybe a captured Blin?</span>
<br><br>
<span>As I expected, she was able to restore others’ magic besides just me and Link. However, it appears to incur a much greater cost—something like an eighty-five to ninety percent loss factor, as opposed to the usual fifteen. Similarly, the rejuvenation effect incurred the same cost. I was hoping this would lead to a way to increase travel speed, by restoring the energy of a swift horse. Perhaps worth trying still, though it may well be prohibitively expensive.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>31st of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I asked Fi if it would be possible to create a similar ability to stamina restoration, except serving a purely defensive function. My thinking was that perhaps she could keep changes to one’s essence from occurring as a result of suffering wounds, thus preventing (or reversing) the damage as soon as it happens. Maybe that’s what the Cane of Byrna did? Assuming it existed, of course.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I didn’t understand much of what she said in response, but it sounds like it won’t work. Something about the target’s essence rejecting unnatural effects? Once again, she asked that I provide her with a working example to draw from, and said that “a description alone is insufficient to generate additional data.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>I don’t have any Canes of Byrna just lying around, Fi!</span>
<br><br>
<span>I followed up by asking if Old Magic-based healing was possible. Surely it wouldn’t be all that different from stamina restoration, right?</span>
<br><br>
<span>But no; she said it was in fact more complicated. She couldn’t rule out the possibility, but again, it poses substantial risk to the subject and she’s unwilling to try. Apparently she only got the stamina restoration to work by testing it on random critters as we travelled. Who knew! But supposedly there are enough biological differences between Hylians and critters that, even though her observations on stamina restoration were transferrable, healing would not be. I have no idea why that is, and she says she can’t explain it to me in terms I would understand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I really hate it when she does that—but every time I press, she does in fact just say nonsense. So frustrating.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Oh, another thought. How does Bloodrage work? Is it, perhaps, Old Magic? I had always assumed Red. This absolutely merits further investigation. Yet again, I come back to the necessity of capturing hapless Blin to subject to my experiments.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>34th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Not sure why I didn’t think of this one sooner, but I asked Fi if marking someone who speaks a different language would allow her to learn it faster. The answer was a simple “yes.” No Fi-speak involved—just “yes!” If only everything involving her were so simple…</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Technically it was “Yes, <i>Mistress</i>,” but I’ll take it.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even so, I’m not comfortable with marking anyone else just yet. That seems most unwise, given Link’s mission. And besides, Shesan told me off when I asked about marking Naibi. I’m not sure who else among the Gerudo I’d want to mark, if not her. Sure, Naibi can be a bit of a pain, but I’ve come to respect her. She’s a true and genuine leader, who cares deeply for her people. I’ve already accepted them as my own. I hope that one day I can get her to do the same for us.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If only it were not for Shesan. Mother Above, that woman…</span>
<br><br>
<span>For now, I’ve instructed Fi to try and learn Gerudo while I get primers on the language—both spoken and written. Also, she can just listen in on conversations of others nearby. She says this should be more than sufficient to develop enough of an understanding to translate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I’ll have to remember to do the same with Zora and Blin once we’re back in Hyrule.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>35th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I had thought to try Healing with green magic on Fi, in hopes that it would restore some of her lost memories. As before with Siphon, her avatar simply isn’t affected. I asked if there might be a way to use Divine Power instead, but I understand precisely nothing of her response.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>1st of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Books!!!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Books books books books books <i>books</i>! Dear Sweet Mother in the Heavens Above, thank you thank you for sending me books!!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link had one of the Sheikah page through them while he rested, and now Fi can translate Old Script! I’m so excited! She tells me they include three training manuals, a cookbook, a story about two suicidal lovers, a compilation of works on abstract philosophies—and a <i>history book!!!!!</i> I can’t wait to read them myself once Link and the others get back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Eeeeeeee!</span>
<br><br>
<span>…<i>Come on</i>, Zelda! Be professional. These are your <i>research notes.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahem.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To any and all future historians reading this, I am certain you can relate to my excitement. I hope you do not judge me too harshly.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>Addendum:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Apparently, <i>Transfabrulators</i> are a thing. See section 7, page 9 for details. We finally have a servicable magic artifact! I can’t wait to learn all its secrets.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>2nd of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I had another idea for Fi to develop. Hylia was able to empower me back during the siege—no telling what all it involved, but at minimum it gave me nearly unlimited magic and significant resistance to physical injury. Could “Empowerment” be scaled down to just those effects?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi is already capable of restoring both magic and stamina. And at least <i>theoretically</i>, she observed my essence before, during, and after that event, and has also had plenty of time to observe others using magic. Is that enough data for her to work with?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once Link is done with his trials, I’ve asked her to look into this and let me know what she thinks. I really hope this one pans out.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>3rd of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>My idea for “Lesser Empowerment” actually seems doable? Fi says there’s nothing in principle preventing her from recreating something similar. Mostly, she needs to do substantial work to improve the efficiency of converting Divine Power to magic first (both in terms of time and conversion ratio), and also fine-tune her approach to stamina restoration. I surmise from that it just means having her use both abilities a ton and hoping she can make improvements?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Following that, she estimates needing on the order of 10,000 to 100,000 Divine Power to work out a way to continuously channel the effect in a way that is safe, useful, and not ludicrously wasteful. But she does believe it’s practicable. Color me surprised!</span>
<br><br>
<span>It would be nice to have such an ability, but I also have to ask: is it worth the cost? It would save us from having to maintain a separate pool of magic for emergencies, and we also wouldn’t have to worry about running out in a pinch. On the other hand, that is quite a chunk of Divine Power.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…I suppose it depends on whether or not Link’s Lightsworn status continues to pay such enormous dividends? Here’s to hoping.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On the subject of the transfabrulator, good news: the three Sheikah assigned to Link are able to use it without issue. I was worried that, as with the gemstones from the spire, it would be limited to Lightsworn only. Thankfully, that seems not to be the case.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Bad news: Fi tells me she has absolutely no idea how it works, that its ability to “recharge” is entirely self-contained (that is, she cannot discern any differences between its charged and uncharged states), and further cautions that any attempts to modify it may impede its function or even render it inoperant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Eeep. I’d rather not.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If nothing else, it should cause the stone tablet to react. Perhaps we can use that to make progress on figuring out its area detection ability? It might also be worth testing at various distances to precisely define its range as a function of charge.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>It was so easy. Effortless.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link slashed with his sword, lobbing the head off one attacker and carving halfway into another’s chest on the follow-through. He sidestepped a club strike and ran his blade through the heart of a third, then let go and rolled to evade a flurry of spear thrusts. Inside the fourth and final’s guard, Link leapt up from the roll and bashed the spearman’s skull in with the side of his shield, dropping him to the ground like a sack of bricks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They had opted to raid one of the larger bandit camps on the way to Ibboso’s graveyard. Same tactics as before; he and Grenja engaged the main force directly while Koja and Ryn took out stragglers from afar.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ꡑꡀꡤ, ꡦꡟꡛꡀꡲꡀꡟꡟꡖꡨ-ꡯꡟ꡵ꡀꡈꡨ!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned to see a female bandit brandishing an axe charging towards him at a dead sprint. He raised his shield and braced himself. A split second before the bandit hit him, he crouched and <i>lunged</i>, darting forward to smash into her chest from an angle. Her momentum carried her forward and over his head, and with a great shove from below, the fool flew through the air and smashed into a boulder several yards away with a whet <i>crack</i>. Her body crumpled lifelessly to the ground, unmoving.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oof. He almost felt bad. This level of overkill was simply ludicrous. He had fought <i>fiends</i> that put up more of a fight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Almost” being the operative word. This was a gang of bloodthirsty, lawless, murdering, thieving bandits after all. They had even politely asked them to surrender at the start of this mess, too! Link went through all the trouble of getting Zelda to pass him a translated phrase for “please, we just want to trade!” followed by “lay down your weapons and we won’t harm you!”—but no! These crazy, suicidal jerks just yelled incomprehensibly and tried to kill them anyway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link walked over and yanked his sword free from the corpse. Ahead, a group of seven or so bandits huddled together about twenty yards away. More organized than the last bunch, they were slowly, cautiously inching their way towards him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tried the phrase for “surrender!” again. One of them made a rude gesture and spat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With sword and shield in either hand, Link spread his arms out to the sides in a universally understood gesture. It left him wide open, but it also spoke volumes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The group stopped dead in their tracks. Paralyzed. Whether in fear, anger, or just plain awe, Link had no idea. It didn’t matter either way. <i>Finally</i> they had chosen to see reason. Finally—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—A bright green dodecahedron flew in from his side, turning them all into bloody paste.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Man, this thing is <i>awesome</i>!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned to see Grenja smiling like an idiot. Well, so much for that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, sorry! Were you about to fight those guys? My bad. Good news though: this thing really fits my style, ya know? I can just punch and it’s all like <i>VORP</i> and the enemies are all like <i>OH NO</i> and the best part is that I still have my hands free to do <i>more punching</i>! Aww yeah! —HEY, WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU’RE RUNNING OFF TO?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sighed, rubbing his forehead.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Hey! Come on, Link, leave some for the rest of us!” Koja said, giving him a stink-eye. “Keep on like that and we’ll have to raid another camp tomorrow.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey yourself, he needs it!” Grenja said. “That’s just what happens when you fight a big mess of those thugs all at once. All in a day’s work—ain’t that right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link lamely met Grenja’s high-five as he struggled to swallow his food. He took a gulp of water to help it down. “Sorry,” he said. “Stamina restoration. It was bad before, but now it just leaves me feeling like I’ve never eaten in my life.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So is that what the magic water did?” Ryn asked. “Made you stronger? Faster? I saw you out there. You didn’t even use Invigorate! That was some crazy shit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, I think so?” Link said, putting away the rest of his bowl between breaths. “’s hard to explain. Like, I’m lighter, or something? It’s like… all the things I could do before… just don’t take as much effort as they used to.” He belched and blushed, excusing himself to the sound of laughter from the women.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought passed by, and on a whim he decided to go for it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here, watch this.” Link stood and took up the transfabrulator, fiddled with the settings, then held it out to the side. A large green cube materialized a few feet away and fell into the dirt with a <i>THUMP</i>, kicking up a cloud of dust. He looked back and winked, strapped the device to his belt, then strode over to the block as he flexed and psyched himself up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Bracing against the cube, he set his back and adjusted his footing. Before, it took a great deal of effort just to get the thing moving. Now?</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>THIS IS FOR THAT FICKING RABBIT</i>—“RAAAAHHH!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He <i>shoved</i> with everything he had—every muscle of his body tensing and contracting in perfect sync as raw power coursed through them. The block shot forward, thumping loudly across the ground as it tumbled down the slight incline and dispersed into motes of emerald light when it fell out of range.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link panted to catch his breath, followed up by a good swig from his waterskin. He wiped his brow, then stumbled back to the trio. Each of them stared at him in awe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s something like that,” he said smugly. He dusted himself off and took another sip of water before sitting back down. Phew. That was quite a bit more exhausting than he anticipated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whoa,” Grenja said reverently. “Link—that’s incredible! So you’re what, super strong now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh, not really,” he said honestly. He flexed his arm and made a fist before loosening up. He certainly hadn’t gained any muscle. “It doesn’t feel like I’m <i>stronger</i>, really, just like… I have more stamina? More coordination? Endurance, maybe? I still get tired if I push too hard. I’m not sure what to call it. It just feels like I can keep going well past my old limits without straining and without much effort.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn’s eyes glinted in the last light of the evening sun. She—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“More endurance, huh?” Koja said impishly. “Keep on going, huh? Oh yeah, I bet that could come in real handy, if you know what I mean.” She winked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—scowled menacingly at her partner and teammate. The older Sheikah stood and leveled a finger at the younger woman. “That’s <i>it!</i> I’ve ficking had it up to here with these second-rate dirty jokes! I am <i>formally</i> arresting you for crimes against the kingdom. Do not attempt to resist!” She turned to Link. “Sir, requesting permission for summary execution!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link blinked. “Uhm, no? Permission denied? Stand down?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn’s mouth drew to a line. “I’m sorry sir, but I can’t obey that order.” She unsheathed her dagger and rounded on Koja—just to get a big splash of water in her face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Both of the women fell to the ground laughing. Link looked over to Grenja. The man covered his face and shook his head. <i>Yeah, right there with you</i>, the expression said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, uh, on the topic of Lightsworn stuff…” Link said, opting to deal with the duo the only way he knew how. That was, when Koja and Ryn were imitating a troupe of jesters, he found it was best to just pretend it wasn’t happening, and carry on like everything was normal. Or try to, anyway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He cleared his throat. “There was something I wanted to ask you all to get your opinion on. If we found another silvery egg, or some other Lightsworn artifact, or figured out another way to make more people into Lightsworn but it was still somehow limited… who would be the best choice for it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A gust of desert wind blew through the clearing. The embers of their cooking fire sputtered and crackled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wouldn’t that be up to the Queen?” Ryn said. “Sounds like something she’d have to decide.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, yeah,” Link said. “But ultimately she’s going to leave that up to me. I know her well enough by now. She’ll have opinions, sure, but in the end it’s going to be my call. Believe me, I’d rather not be the one, but I don’t exactly have a choice, either. If we get there… if that happens, then I want to have it sorted out well ahead of time. And to be honest? I don’t know the Sheikah that well. Besides you guys, the only others that come to mind are General Wymar and Captain Izu. I just want to make the most informed decision I can. If it comes to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja grunted and leaned forward, visibly shifting into what Link mentally referred to as his ‘serious mode.’ The rest of them waited for him to speak.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Captain Izu,” he said finally. “That man is without a doubt the best swordsman in the kingdom. And yeah, he’s better than you too in terms of raw skill, even if your fancy Lightsworn stuff would probably send him packing.” He rubbed his chin, looking deep in thought. “Yeah, just thinkin’ about it, he would definitely fit the bill. Can’t even imagine what a Lightsworn Izu would be capable of. The captain—he has my vote.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It said something profound about Grenja’s character that he of all people would willingly pass up the opportunity to become the next Lightsworn in favor of someone he thought was a better pick. Link wasn’t sure what that was exactly, but it was no doubt profound.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As far as the Sheikah go,” Ryn said. “Sure, there’s us. I mean, I would never say no, but Laylith wouldn’t be a bad choice either. She’s no fighter—neither am I—but she’s smart, and talented, and a top-notch Blue mage. Yours truly couldn’t hope to compete. I’d say ‘best at her craft,’ but if that’s the case it’s only ’cause Impa died.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded. There was a reason she was the one looking after Zelda in his absence, after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…He looked around. The others had gone quiet and still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gee, I don’t think I would mind getting some awesome magical powers,” Koja said sarcastically. “But, ya know, it just sounds like it would be an awful lot of work. I think I’ll pass. It’d cut too much into my dedicated slacking-off time, and I just can’t have that. Speaking of, I think it’s about time to hit the hay. ’Night folks.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stood and left, leaving Link to wonder what in damnation just happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You just had to go there, didn’t you?” Grenja said, once Koja was out of earshot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? You know it’s true. Just because—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Don’t.” Grenja said. “That’s low, even for you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn sat up straight. “And what’s that supposed to mean?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It means I know you don’t mean anything by it, but you have no taste, and you should learn to respect the dead,” Grenja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn sighed, throwing up her hands. “Fine. Sorry. You’re right. I’m an insensitive, worthless piece of shit. I’ll apologize to Koja later.” She fell on her back, looking up at the sky.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja grunted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So… what about the other Sheikah back at camp?” Link said, trying to change the subject. He wasn’t sure what all that was about, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to know. “Cove? Malg?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Fick</i> Malg,” Ryn said. “Right up the arse with a rusty knife. Last thing the kingdom needs is that guy having more of a reason to be an insufferable jerkwad.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, you said it,” Grenja said with a laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Cove’s not bad, though,” Ryn said. “Sweet kid. Lots of potential, even if he is a bit messed up in the head.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, that kid’s got more raw talent than anyone I’ve ever seen,” Grenja said. “But he’s still young and he’s got a lot to learn. Not him.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded. Wait, how was <i>Cove</i> the one messed up in the head?</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>For quite possibly the first time ever, he wasn’t the cause of the awkward silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good talk,” Grenja said, slapping his knee. “I think I’ll turn in too.” He nodded to the pair and headed off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t ask.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wasn’t gonna.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Nothing. Just forget it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link thought long and hard about it, then decided to rustle over and lay down next to her. Ryn took his hand in hers. It felt warm, and nice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ever do any stargazing?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not really,” he said. The sky wasn’t quite dark enough for it yet, but the first few stars were starting to come out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, me neither.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Koja does though. She could tell you all the constellations. And she always has the phases of the moon memorized out to like, a month. Seriously, she could have told you a week ago that Nia wouldn’t be joining us tonight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gave a noncommittal grunt as he scanned the sky. Sure enough, the telltale glow of the moon was missing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn rolled over on her side to face him. Link turned his head an inch or so to look up at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You really aren’t going to ask?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you want me to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She hesitated. “I’m not sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “Then I won’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it then? Do you just not care?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course I care.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn shook her head, then laid down on his chest. “I don’t get you, Link. I thought I did, but I don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t get you either, Ryn.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then what is this?” she said. “What are we doing?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I thought we were stargazing.”</span>
<br><br>
