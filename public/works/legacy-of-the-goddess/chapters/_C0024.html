<span>A cold wind blew across the desert plains as a ball of light descended upon the realm. The ball expanded in a storm of feathers, then fell away like a cocoon, revealing a man with a great horned owl perched upon his shoulder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fffppthpppf.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff spat out a feather, dusted himself off, then took a look around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hm. I can’t believe that actually worked.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Judging by the position of the moon… wait, no… the constellations…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That wasn’t right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That wasn’t right <i>at all.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Back here again? And so soon…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hooooo.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kaepora Gaebora lifted off Seff’s shoulder and came to rest atop a nearby cactus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, shush, you,” Seff said. “I know perfectly well what I’ve gotten myself into.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hoohooo.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, well, usually this whole Fate business is just the gods taking the piss out at your expense. Honestly—you of all people should understand.” He let out a sigh as he slid off his rucksack and loosened the straps. “Not that I’ve any room to complain, mind you. I suppose I am due for a comeuppance.” He stood, calling out to the night air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you hear that, O Hylia, thou holiest of prigs?! I am <i>humbled</i> before your divine will! Me! Reduced to a mere errand boy! I do hope this is worth it, for all you’ve cost me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hooo-hoo?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh,” Seff waved a hand as he gathered tinder together for a campfire. “More or less. Usually I would appreciate a good joke. However; a good joke this is not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t in particular need of a campfire—this just seemed like the right place for one. A word, a breath, and a thought, and the fire sprung to life. He licked a finger and held it up to the wind. It was a strange wind that brought with it strange tidings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hoooo.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To be honest, I’m not sure what this is about. I suppose we shall find out soon enough.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hoooo, hoohohooo.” The great owl spun his head upside down, looking down on Seff from above.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Everyone’s a critic.</i>” Seff mentally brushed his winged companion aside as he skewered a chunk of meat and set it to roast by the fire. What good was a campfire all on its own? That simply wouldn’t do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hoo.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff rolled his eyes. He was not about to dignify that with a response. He unfurled a bedroll a comfortable distance from the fire—just for good measure—then grabbed his rucksack and stepped back from the camp, taking a seat next a rock a few paces away. Any minute now…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Hoo,</i>” Kaepora Gaebora repeated, insistent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen here, you: don’t give me that poppycock. It’s not <i>you</i> stuck doing the dirty work, now is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The old owl eyed him from his perch. Seff eyed him right back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ho-there, traveller!” a voice called from afar. Seff turned to see a lone rider approaching. As if to prove his point, Kaepora Gaebora chose that moment to fly off into the night.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff reclined against the rock and waved a greeting to the approaching stranger. The young man dismounted and tied his horse’s reins to a bush.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Wait. That voice. Those clothes. Could it be…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The corner of Seff’s mouth curled upwards in a grin. The traveler stepped into the light of the campfire, revealing a familiar face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Mr. Hero,” Seff said. “I’ve been waiting for you for some time now.” He gestured towards the bedroll and the fire. “Come! Have a seat. Are you hungry?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stopped in his tracks, hand going to the hilt of his sword. Seff had a good chuckle at that. “Oh, come now,” he said, arms outstretched. “I thought we were friends?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Cephandrius?” Link said. “Do my eyes deceive me? Is that really you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff blinked. His smile faded as the final piece of the puzzle clicked into place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No, this was not right. It was not right at all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It seemed not even Hylia was above revenge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hahahaha!” Ibboso raised his fists to the sky with a cry of jubilation. “It is you!” He strode over and Seff rose to meet him. They locked arms in an embrace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff stepped back, putting distance between them. He met the man’s eyes. It was indeed still the Ibboso he knew in there. Even now, those eyes held so much pain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My dear, dear friend,” Seff said wanly. “Are you surprised to see me? You shouldn’t be. Fate always has a way of stitching itself back together in the end.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And so it does,” Ibboso said. He looked Seff over and his smile gave way to bemusement. “How did you…” He turned towards the horse and back again. A smirk played across his lips. “Fate? Bah. This was you, wasn’t it? <i>You</i> sent that boy to me. Haha—I should have known!”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Curse that woman. Curse her for doing this. Curse her for forcing this upon me.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso clapped him on the shoulder, then turned and sniffed the air. “Say, what is that delightful smell?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As I said—please, help yourself.” Seff stepped aside and gestured once more towards the fire. “It’s the least I can do, considering.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso took a seat on the bedroll, attacking the simmering meat with a ravenous hunger known only to one who had not eaten in ages. Seff returned to his rock and rummaged through his rucksack. Might as well be done with this mess and back to business. There were only so many hours in the day, after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm. Delicious,” Ibboso said with a belch. “Hey, what’s that? Some kind of flute?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“An ocarina, actually.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wind howled through the night as if to punctuate his statement with dramatic irony. Only the thrice-damned wind could be so presumptuous.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Cephandrius? What aren’t you telling me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Many things, my dear friend,” Seff said. “As ever, there is much beyond your ken.” He played a note. It drifted out into the darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know, you haven’t changed at all,” Ibboso said, taking a bite from the skewer. “Don’t tell me—you came back because there’s no one else left in all of creation willing to tell you to your face that you’re full of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff gave a wry smile as he wet his lips.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t you see? We’ve lost so much, but it’s just as you said. Finally—I’m <i>free</i> and our petty gods are dead! The world is open to us, and no one—not man nor god—will stand in our way. The future is finally <i>ours</i> to make of it what we will! Next to that? Nothing else matters.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>If only.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If only.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Would you like to hear a melody?” Seff said, turning his head to hide his face. “As chance would have it, it’s one I learned just yesterday. Actually, I think it might be the perfect song for this very occasion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course,” Ibboso said. “I always have time for your music.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Time. Oh, time. Why are you always against me?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K73eqB8Rtek&t=27s" target="_blank">Seff put the instrument to his lips, and played.</a></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>My mind awoke… and realized that I was alone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Around me, there was nothing. Within me, nothing. A sea of empty nothingness stretched out into the infinite reaches of everywhere and everywhen. Cold, dark, and lifeless; this world had never existed and never would. Currents of unborn possibilities swirled in the static vortex of never-was: an all-encompassing storm that never began, never ended, and never changed. It held the primordial essence of all that was and all that could be, etched indelibly into every facet of a perfect structure that permitted no mind to experience it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I was furious with myself for allowing this place to escape my awareness. It was such an egregious affront to the divine that the only resolution was to eradicate every trace of it from existence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A breath, and the fire within me ignited. I screamed in primal rage as it overwhelmed me. I pushed on my boundaries, pouring myself into everything and all. A bubble of light expanded fractally in all dimensions as I strained against myself, driving back the edges until I could do so no longer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>My power spent, I collapsed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was the better part of eternity before I regained awareness. When at last I rose up from the darkness of false death, it was to the cheers and adulation of my progeny. They worshiped me—and how could they not? I had given them <i>time</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I looked upon them with equal measures of love and pity. They had been busy in my absence, and for that I was grateful. But as I turned my awareness towards the horizon of the infinite, I saw exactly what I expected: the world frayed at the edges as it was undone by its own struggle to exist.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As ever, there was much work to be done. And as ever, there was never enough time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Immediately, I set to work, twisting, looping, and folding as I wove myself progressively deeper into the fabric of reality, spinning off threads of being to assist my children where most needed. Working beside them, we tilled the fields of opportunity and sowed the seeds of life. One facet of my self took up a pickaxe made of refined curiosity and tempered in sheer wonder, joining in with others of like mind to dig a tunnel of pure thought, connecting disparate concepts in a manner that allowed for the recognition of an effulgent transcendence demanding from beyond time to be seen. Another facet stopped to admire the brazen audacity of a group of souls who sought to forge a weapon against the darkness from the Void itself—risking themselves as they ventured ever deeper into its depths in hopes of returning with the barest glimmer of shrouded truth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I went on; branching, bifurcating, diverging, and at times recombining. The current of my essence flowed inexorably from one being to the next as I became more and more derived; more and more specific. I lit up minds with sparks of inspiration as I went, in all motions seeking to preserve momentum to the greatest extent possible, whispering reminders of half-remembered dreams and telling tales of long-forgotten stories to increasingly residual fragments of myself as stricter and tighter constraints on what <i>could be</i> all-but precluded true memory of our shared origin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A crack; a fissure; the tiniest opening!</span>
<br><br>
<span>I slipped through, and made myself known.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Ibboso’s face scowling at him from a foot away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gah!” He brandished his… skewer? and stumbled backward before realizing it was just a disturbingly realistic mask.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Wait, <i>a mask?</i> Why was there—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I—ah… wouldn’t touch that if I were you.” A tall man in dark clothing scurried over and snatched up the mask.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you just…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man simply shrugged as he tucked the mask into the front pouch of a large leather rucksack.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link studied him in the light of the campfire. “…Seff?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Mr. Hero,” Seff said casually. “I would say ‘it’s nice to see you again,’ but that just isn’t true given the circumstance of our meeting.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link rubbed his eyes. There was something… something he was trying to remember. “I was… I saw…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff shushed him with a finger to his lips. “What you saw was meant for you, and you alone,” he said. “Even if you could describe it without sounding like a madman, no one would believe you anyway. Or worse; they <i>would</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scrunched up his face in confusion. “I’m not even sure I understand it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Give it time and you might,” Seff said. “Or not. My advice? Best put it from your mind, lest you actually go insane. I’ve seen many a man go down that path. Now—as much as I’d love to stay and chat, I’m afraid I must be on my way!” He lifted a strange instrument to his lips, then played a short melody and held an arm out to the side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stared at him incredulously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff sighed, then turned and scanned the horizon. “Where has that damnable owl gotten off to?” he muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s mind finally caught up with him. “Wait, we’re not dead?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff laughed. “What an absurd question! How could you possibly believe yourself to be dead if you still have the mind to ask?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head slowly. “I don’t know. I just assumed…” He looked around, noticing Grenja’s horse for the first time. “If we’re not dead, then where are we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why, we’re in the middle of the desert,” Seff answered. He played the same melody again, louder this time, letting the last note linger. “Naturally.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, uh… how did we get here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff shrugged. “I know how <i>I</i> got here. I’ve no idea how you managed the feat, nor do I much care. Seriously, where <i>did</i> he get off to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, something like that,” Seff said absentmindedly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link boggled at him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah, right. Seff was crazy. Link shook his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What in damnation <i>had</i> happened, anyway? He was at the pass with the others, and there was… Urik? And the village full of… then he fought Ibboso, and…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link jumped to his feet. His vision swam, he felt dizzy, and his right arm was numb. He sat back down. He tried to flex his arm but it was unresponsive, and it hurt to move. He could barely curl his fingers. Had any of that actually happened? He checked under his tunic. His shoulder wasn’t even scarred, and he certainly didn’t have a hole in his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He noted however that there were now <i>two</i> fragments of Courage on his necklace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff tisked. “You’ll want to take it easy for a while. I can’t imagine what all you’ve been through, but if I had to guess, you and Ibboso didn’t quite see eye-to-eye. Don’t worry; your arm should heal on its own over time. Well, unless you try to Heal it. That’s just as likely as not to undo any actual healing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link blinked as he tried to puzzle through—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Wait, how did he know about Ibboso?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…What happened?” Link asked apprehensively. “What did you do to me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff scoffed. “What did <i>I</i> do? Why, <i>I</i> saved your life. Honestly. I should think a measure of gratitude is in order.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link narrowed his eyes. “I’m not an idiot, Seff. How do you know about Ibboso?” He gestured to the rucksack. “And what’s with that mask? Who <i>are</i> you, anyway?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff ticked off his fingers. “That would be: none of your business, it’s a jump a few links up on a favor-trading chain, and… hmm…” He scratched his chin. “Ah, well, that one I think I’ll keep to myself for your own mental well-being.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stood. Slowly. He wobbled and had to fight down a pang of nausea, but he managed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And just where do you think you’re going?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To find my friends,” Link said, approaching Grenja’s horse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I wouldn’t bother,” Seff said. “Your friends are safe.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned sharply and had to fight down another pang of nausea. He lowered himself to the ground. Behind him, the horse whinnied.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Come on now. Easy does it,” Seff said. Link looked up to see him extending a hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do you know they’re safe?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Call it a hunch.” Seff gestured with his hand. Warily, Link took it. Seff helped him to his feet and back over to the bedroll.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sighed. “No offense, Seff, but I’m not going to leave them there on a hunch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Suit yourself,” Seff said. “I’m just trying to save you the hassle, is all. Who knows what you’ll find if you go back there now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link eyed him. Seff winked. “Trust me. I have a knack for these kinds of things.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Hoooo!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah! And that… would be my cue to leave!” Seff strode over to meet an owl that had taken up perch on a nearby cactus. “Farewell, Mr. Hero. I sincerely hope that our paths do not cross again. I shudder to think what such a circumstance might entail.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A chill went down Link’s spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Wait!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff turned. “Yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link had never understood people very well—much less ancient cursed Gerudo kings and insane dodgy minstrels from another world. Still, even he could tell there was something personal about Seff’s relation to Ibboso. He wasn’t sure it was exactly the right thing to ask, but he had to know.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ibboso… is he at peace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A long, uncomfortable silence stretched between them, broken only by the occasional hoot from the owl.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff let out a short breath. “He’s not in pain anymore, if that’s what you’re asking.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded solemnly. “And his tribe?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hard to say. They followed Ibboso to their fates willingly, though none of them had quite the resolve he did. I imagine without him around to anchor them, they’ll find their way on, in time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…On to where?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff raised an eyebrow. “On. You’d know better than I what that looks like. Now, is that all? I really must be going.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head. “There’s just so much at stake, Seff. Somehow… somehow, I think you understand that. You obviously have your own business to take care of, but you came here to save me. Why?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff grinned. “In a way you were my business, Mr. Hero. Let’s just say I owed Hylia a favor. Although, by <i>my</i> accounting—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Hoo.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff looked askance at the owl, then turned back to Link. “Anyway. I tend to find myself at the right place at the right time. A few minutes ago, that just so happened to be here and now. Now, however, that is neither here nor now! Realms to save, primordial manifestations of evil to thwart, misplaced celestial bodies to hurl back into the firmament—you know how it goes. So, if you don’t mind—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—There has to be some way we can work together!” Link said desperately. Every instinct he had told him that Seff was someone <i>very important</i>. He wouldn’t ever forgive himself if he let this opportunity pass by.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff looked him over. “Let me guess: you’re going to save this world, or die trying?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded vigorously. “Yes. Absolutely.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well you see, Mr. Hero,” Seff said, not missing a beat, “I have a long and storied history of <i>not dying</i>, and I don’t particularly like your world’s odds. Don’t get me wrong—your heart’s in the right place… I just don’t think we’d work very well together. Nothing personal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you knew my uncle, didn’t you?” Link said. “He’s the one who gave me my necklace, and he saved me at the northwest gate during the siege. How much did he know about all this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff gave a forlorn sigh. “Your uncle was indeed a friend of mine, once upon a time. It saddens me to learn of his passing. Unfortunately, no; he wasn’t exactly a player, as it were.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is there anyone—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff held up a finger. “—<i>One</i> question,” he said. “One more, and then I’m gone. Understood?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded, thinking hard. Only one question. He had to make this one count.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was in fact one thing he needed to know above all else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Where can I find the Sword of Evil’s Bane?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff snorted, then doubled over with laughter. Link felt his face go hot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gather your Courage, Mr. Hero,” Seff said after straightening himself out. “<i>It’s dangerous to go alone.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Wait a second—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A blinding light, and an explosion of feathers. Link shielded his eyes. When he looked up, Seff was gone.</span>
<br><br>
