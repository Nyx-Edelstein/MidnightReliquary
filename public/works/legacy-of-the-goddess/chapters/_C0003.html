<span>“There isn’t much to say,” Link said, looking distant. “Just as I was about to go after the Warlord, Uncle Raolin came bursting through with four other soldiers. He was shouting something in their language—I don’t know what.” He shook his head. “But the throng parted for him. And then… and then the Warlord just started to laugh. I didn’t know what was happening. Uncle was yelling at me, ordering me to fall back, but… I couldn’t leave him there. I tried to fight, but the other soldiers dragged me away. And then it was over. The Warlord left, and the rest of them swarmed us. We tried to hold out. I was the last. And then you showed showed up. I suppose you know the rest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded as she followed his story. She could only imagine what it was like to go through such an ordeal. “I’m so very sorry to hear that, Link,” she offered after a solemn pause. “I didn’t know Raolin personally myself, but I heard only great things about him. Our kingdom is darker for his passing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A long, uncomfortable silence stretched between them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you,” he said at last.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shifted in her seat. She took a sip of her wine, then set it down and tapped nervously on the table. He was a difficult one. She wasn’t quite sure how best to broach the topic, and he certainly wasn’t making it easy on her either. But she had to know, preferably sooner rather than later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you given any thought to my offer?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” he said flatly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>No?!</i>” How dare he refuse! …She watched in dismay as he shied away, and decided to bite back her tongue. She needed to tread carefully here; she couldn’t risk alienating him. It wasn’t over yet. There was still a chance she could win him over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link,” she said, with all the empathy she could muster. “Please, hear me out. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you. I <i>need</i> someone like you at my side. You would be one of the most influential men in the kingdom!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sighed, looking visibly conflicted. Good. She could work with that. Zelda placed her hands on the table and leaned forward, trying to catch his eye with a friendly smile. To her chagrin, he refused to make eye contact.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I understand,” he said after a long moment of contemplation. “And under other circumstances I would likely accept. But this? It isn’t for me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed. What could she say to that?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s just, they’re still out there," he said with a gesture. “People are still fighting. Dying. There are people out there who will <i>die</i> if I don’t help. They need me. I have to go, as soon as I’m able.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link—<i>I</i> need you,” Zelda said. “You’ve already gone far and above your duty.” She paused, searching for the right words. She was about to say that there were plenty of soldiers left to fight in his stead, but she knew that wasn’t exactly true.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I admire your dedication, and your sense of honor. But you can do just as much for the kingdom as my personal champion, if not more. As Queen, it is <i>my</i> ultimate responsibility to see our people safe. <i>My</i> responsibility to heal the damage and undo the destruction wrought by the Blight. And I am offering <i>you</i> the chance to take direct part in that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She studied him carefully, but couldn’t get a read. He was completely opaque to her. Was there anything else she could use to tip the scales in her favor? By all appearances, he wasn’t motivated by glory or titles or fame or prestige. It was a fair bet that more money wouldn’t sway him either.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Maybe if she were more open with him? More vulnerable. She didn’t like the thought, but she had to admit it might work to get him thinking of her as another helpless innocent that needed saving. It wasn’t even that much of a lie, especially since…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raw, unprocessed emotions welled up within. She let just enough of it through to the surface to be seen, just enough to proceed without risk of falling apart again. Just enough to bring tears to her eyes. Just enough to put a measure of strain into her voice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link. Like you, I lost someone very dear to me. She was the older sister I never had. The closest thing to a mother I knew, since my own died so many years ago.” She touched her hand to her chest. “Impa was always there for me, and she always watched my back. And now… she’s gone now… and…” she paused to take a breath and wipe her eyes, composing herself. It was far more difficult than she thought it would be, but she managed. “And now the Sheikah are in disarray, and there are scant few I can trust. Not a week ago I was the target of an assassination attempt, and I have no reason to believe they’ll stop there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was listening now—rapt with attention. She had him exactly where she wanted him. And now, for the finishing blow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m scared, Link,” she said. “Hylia saved me once, but I can hardly rely on divine intervention every time I’m in danger. I have to believe that she sent me to save you for a reason, and if not this—then what? Link, I need your help. You will help me, won’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, I can confirm—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aah!” Zelda jumped, and a blur of motion sent her reeling. Before she knew it, Fi had vanished and Link was at her side holding his cane at guard, urging her to stay behind him. Her thoughts caught up to her, and she burst out laughing just as her guard detail came streaming into the study, barking orders. It was all so absurd.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright! Everyone!” Zelda yelled, standing and raising her hands in a placating gesture. “Calm down. It’s okay. There’s no cause for alarm!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you sure? We heard—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Izu,” Zelda interrupted. “Thank you for your concern. I applaud your swift action, but everything is fine. Please—return to your posts. And do not allow anyone to enter this room until further notice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The captain and the other soldiers left the room, leaving her alone with the beleaguered veteran brandishing his walking cane as if it were a sword. Zelda frowned and shook her head. Were she not still recovering from exhaustion, she would have felt compelled to soothe his poor soul.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress,</i> Fi’s voice echoed in her mind, <i>I must request that you ask Link to refrain from further assault. Manifesting an avatar capable of interacting with you both is expensive, and if he attacks again it may be several days before I am able to proceed with my task.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey. It’s alright, Link,” Zelda said gently. “That was Fi. She’s the Emissary of the Holy Mother. I haven’t heard from her in some time, but it’s likely she has important information to share.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stammered, dropping his cane. “You mean I attacked the Emissary of Hylia?!” His face went beet red—he looked as if he might drop dead from sheer embarrassment. Zelda had to keep herself from giggling at his expense. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“It appears you have. But no worry! There was no harm done, and she is unlikely to take offense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link took a moment to process that. Zelda smiled reassuringly and retrieved his cane. He thanked her, and shuffled back to his seat. She sat as well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe it’s safe now, Fi,” Zelda called out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ephemeral specter materialized at the side of the table. “Apologies,” her voice echoed, “For the purposes of calibrating future interaction, would you classify that as a ‘dramatic entrance?‘”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is she always like that?” Link asked, staring in open wonder at the chromatic entity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled to herself. “You’ll get used to it.” She turned her attention back to Fi. “I would say that was quite dramatic, yes. But you really must try and give more warning before popping in like that. It can be quite disconcerting for us mere mortals.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Noted,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait—” Zelda said, the realization dawning on her. “Why was your ‘manifestation’ interrupted just then, but it wasn’t when I attacked you with my magic?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You did <i>what</i>?” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, I request that you exercise patience. I will be happy to answer your query, but there are more pertinent matters to discuss first.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmph.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” Zelda said. “You know, I’ve been calling for you for a while now? I hope you have a good reason for ignoring me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed I do. Unfortunately, it is my duty to inform you that Hylia’s power is spent, and she is no more."</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>What??</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hylia’s dead?!"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said. “You must be mistaken. How can that be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unfortunately, I am not. Her Grace expended the last of her strength in empowering you, and in ensuring the armies progressed in fighting back the Blin invasion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sputtered. “But—no—how—what—how can—” He took a breath. “What does this <i>mean</i>? We have to tell someone!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said firmly, shooting him a look. “You will not mention this to <i>anyone</i>.” She raised an eyebrow, letting him know she was <i>very</i> serious. “I will talk directly with the High Priestess. You will leave the matter to me. Understood?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, okay,” Link said hastily. “I mean, uh—yes, Your Grace. As you command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is more,” Fi said, recapturing their attention with a twirl. “Zelda: you have an unparalleled mind, considerable ambition, and a deep compassion for your kingdom. You have have earned Nayru’s favor, and have bonded with a piece of Wisdom. With her final act, Her Grace, the Goddess Hylia, has chosen you as her personal champion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gaped. <i>Hylia’s personal champion?!</i> As if being Queen weren’t enough!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link:” Fi continued. “You are a peerless warrior, a natural leader, and your courage is second to none. You are Farore’s chosen, and have bonded with a piece of Courage.” Link’s hand immediately went to his chest. Zelda started, eyes wide. <i>He has a fragment of Courage?!</i> That would explain a few things. ”—Hylia wishes for you to guard and protect Zelda, and to keep her safe from harm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span></span>
<span>“Show me,” Zelda commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hesitantly, Link drew out his necklace. A jagged fragment of gold; much the same as the one Zelda bore in her locket. There was no mistaking it; Farore’s chosen indeed. She had thought the fragments of Courage to be wholly lost to time, but this changed everything.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought came unbidden, and Zelda couldn’t help herself. The pain was too raw—too immediate in her mind. “And what of Impa?” she demanded. She regretted the outburst immediately, but she was committed now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What of <i>her</i>?” she asked, insistent. “You sent me to save Link, but what of <i>Impa</i>? She was every bit his equal, and she was in pursuit of Vesyrn who has stolen not one, but <i>three</i> fragments of the golden power. If the fragments are so important, then why let Impa die? Would she have not been Din’s chosen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda tried to control herself—tried to bite back the vitriol—but she was not doing a very good job of it. She could only imagine how she came across to the poor man sitting across from her. Arlinkar, for his part, sat silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say with certainty,” Fi said. “Unfortunately, Her Grace did not make the details of her plans known to me. I can only surmise that she chose as best she could from the limited options available to her at the time. It is exceedingly likely that any deviation from her plans would have resulted in catastrophe. Impa’s death, while costly, may not have been worth preventing if it meant Hyrule would fall.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grit her teeth and clenched her fists under the table. Perhaps if she were clearer of mind—if the events did not involve her personally—perhaps then she might have been willing to follow that line of reasoning. As it were, she couldn’t help but wonder if the Goddesses ever really cared about their people to begin with. She felt used. As if she were a tool, and little more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have additional information to share regarding to Impa, if you would like,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s attention snapped immediately to Link. Did he really need to be present for this?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can this wait until later?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is important for Link to have this information as well,” Fi replied. “He is every bit as important to Hylia’s plans as you are, Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” Zelda said tersely. “Go on, then.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Fi finished her accounting and Zelda sat back in her seat, feeling overwhelmed. There was so much to take in. She had lost track of how many times her world had been upended during this conversation alone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have more to share,” Fi said. ”Please inform me when you are ready to proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>More?</i>” Zelda glanced over to Link. He had all but withdrawn into himself and didn’t look like he had anything to say. She wasn’t sure what to make of the man. She was barely dealing with this barrage of mind-shattering information herself. What was he thinking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One moment,” Zelda said tentatively. She grabbed a thin stack of papers and dipped a quill to ink, scribbling furiously, noting her current train of thought and all the threads she meant to follow up on.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “Okay. I’m listening,” she said after a moment, ready to take more notes. “Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is now my duty to inform you of my abilities, which will be made available to you as needed, subject to my own limitations. They are as such,“ Fi began.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My primary function was to assist Hylia in communicating with her subjects in this realm, and I possess several abilities to this effect. I may telepathically communicate with you—Zelda—though the same ability incurs much greater cost with those who do not bear Hylia’s mark.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked up, eyebrows raised. “Cost? Is it different than Blue magic? And what is it you mean by ‘Hylia’s mark?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi <i>hummed</i>, and her prismatic skin rippled, shifting hues. “I will explain. Divine Power is a type of energy that exists in the spiritual realm as an analogue to the magic of your realm. I am able to use this power to affect your realm in a manner not unlike that of your own magic, though in very different ways. It is important to note that my access to it here is limited. However, Hylia was able to mark individuals in this realm to act as as agents of her will, and also as a font of Divine Power within the realm. Indeed; my ability to use Divine Power here stems from, interacts with, and varies substantially with the presence of these marks. The two are very much intertwined.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, jotting down the highlights and trying to keep pace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi went on. “Most directly, I am able to convert Divine Power to magic and bestow it upon those who bear Hylia’s mark. I am also able to expend a minor amount of power to manifest myself and communicate directly with marked individuals. Telepathy remains the most cost-efficient for simple communication, though protracted conversations may necessitate manifesting an avatar. With substantially higher cost, I am able to manifest myself in an ethereal form that allows for communication with any being in this realm. Note, however, that this form is somewhat delicate and is easily dispersed with physical or magical force.” Link groaned, resting his head against the table. Fi hummed again and spun about with a pirouette.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda,” Fi said. Zelda looked up from her note-taking. “It is worth noting that you are currently the only individual bearing Hylia’s mark in this realm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… see,” Zelda said, considering. “And is this what you meant earlier by being chosen as Hylia’s champion?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That is precisely correct,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “And you also said those bearing Hylia’s mark acted as ‘fonts’ of Divine Power in the realm. How does that work exactly?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi tilted her head. “It is a… complicated matter. I almost certainly will not be able to explain it to you in terms you will understand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er… can you try?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I will attempt to do so,” Fi said. Her skin rippled as she spoke; this time to violet, then pink, lavender, deep blue, and finally back to neutral. “ᏪᏨᎲᎤᎣ’ ᏇᏨᏍ’ᎤᏨᎤᎧ ᏯᏅᏅᏍ’ ᏡᎤᎾᏅᎺᎺᏬ ᏯᎺ ᏪᏅᏮ’ᏡᏨᏨᎲ’ ᎹᎤᎤᏫᏫ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᎧᏫᏮ’ ᏊᎾᏇ’ᏫᎤᏨ ᏬᎤᏅᏯ’ᎤᏨᏅ ᎧᏨ ᏭᎺᏬ’ ᏬᎤᏅᏯ’ᎤᏨᏅ ᎣᏨᏈ’ᏫᏬ ᏬᏫᏨ ᏑᎾᏫᎲ’ᏅᏫ ᏡᏅᎤᏫᎣ’ᏨᏅᎲ ᎧᎺᏫᏅᏯ ᏮᏫᎤᏫ ᏍᏫᏮ’ᏅᏨᏫᏯ ᏍᎤᏫᏛ’ᎤᏫᏨᏬ ᏭᏨᏫᏯᏫ ᏑᎺᏫᏡ’ᎤᏅᏫ ᏑᏅᏅᏫᎤ ᎧᏨ ᏮᏫᎤᏫ ᏑᏅᏫᎤᏮ’ᎺᏫᎤ ᏈᎺᏨ ᏮᏫᏨᏬ’ ᏭᎺᏭᎤᏫᎤ~ᏬᏅ ᎧᏨ ᏮᏫᎤᏫ ᏍᎤᎧᏫᏯ’ᏫᏫᎾᏮ ᏯᏅᎺᏅᏯ ᏯᎾᏇ’ᎧᏫᏨᏫᏅᎤᎤᏪᏫᏨᏅᎾ ᏯᏅᏅᏍ’ ᏡᎤᎾᏅᎺᎺᏬ ᏑᎺᏫᏡ’ᎤᏅᏫ ᏮᏅᎺᏭ’ᏯᏨᏫᏅᏯᎤᏫᏍ’~ᏇᏨ ᎧᏨ ᏊᏫᏑ’ᎤᏅᏪ ᏭᎺᏭᎤᏫᎤ~ᏬᏅ”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you get any of that?” Link asked, looking completely befuddled. Zelda had almost forgotten he was there.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Nope</i>,” she said with a sigh. She hadn’t been expecting Fi to literally start speaking a foreign language, and gave up attempting to transcribe the syllables halfway through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Apologies, Mistress,” Fi said. “As I said, I am unable to explain precisely the mechanics underlying the phenomenon. For your purposes, however, it should suffice to think of it as such: heroic actions on your part—that is to say, actions more befitting of a Champion of Hylia—will result in me having greater access to Divine Power with which to assist you in your endevors.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Huh.</i> Okay. That sort of made sense? Zelda tapped pensively at her chin as she jotted down her thoughts. When she thought of <i>heroism</i> she wasn’t exactly the first specimen to come to mind—but surely Hylia hadn’t expected her to go galivanting out on adventures to slay monsters? Surely just being Queen had to count for something, right? She sighed, looking up from her notes. This was a lot to keep track of, and even more responsibility being dumped on her lap.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you for the clarifications, Fi,” she said, coming back to herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One more question, before you continue: you mentioned ‘marks,’ plural. In Hylia’s absence, are you or I able to create or place additional marks?” Zelda took note as Link perked up at her question.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A short pause as Fi spun once, twice in the air, shifting colors as she moved. “It is almost certainly the case that I am capable of marking additional individuals,” she said. “However, the feat likely requires far more power than is available to me at present. Perhaps a test would be in order; I would require approximately two hours of uninterrupted time with Link present. This would allow me to provide you with an order-of-magnitude estimate of the power required to mark him. We may proceed at your discretion, Mistress.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, I’m free now if you want to try it?” Link offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. Not now, but soon,” Zelda said, shaking her head. She again took note of Link’s response, watching without comment as he visibly deflated. A modicum more insight into his mind, she supposed. She absolutely intended to follow up later, though for now she needed to get everything she could out of Fi before the emissary disappeared again. “Do you have any other abilities we should know about, Fi?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative,” Fi said. “With substantial cost, I may compel some creatures or beings to perform simple actions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, you mean like… <i>mind-control</i>?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative,” Fi answered. “The effect is significantly weaker when used on more intelligent beings, and will not work if the subject is unwilling or if they are directed to knowingly act against their own interest. The cost also increases substantially with the subject’s mental complexity.” She spun. “Perhaps ‘mind-suggestion’ would be a more appropriate term.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well, that wasn’t terrifying in the least. Zelda made notes to follow up later. ”Anything else?“ she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am uncertain,” Fi said, briefly shifting hues to shades of pink and violet before returning to normal. “Subsequent to Hylia’s passing, I no longer have access to a great deal of previously available knowledge and memories. It is quite likely the case that I am capable of additional feats; however, at present I do not have sufficient information to speculate.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm… interesting. Come to think of it, there were quite a few items of note in the historical record that might be worth looking deeper into, especially considering the context. And with this new potential source of information…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi? If I were to present you with, I don’t know—an assortment of myths, legends, historical accounts of magical artifacts? Would you be able to tell if they were similar to abilities you once had access to, or abilities bestowed to Champions of Hylia in ages past?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say for certain, but it is a distinct possibility,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well. That wasn’t the answer she was hoping for, but it was better than nothing. And it wouldn’t hurt to do just a bit of research. If nothing else, it would give her a much-needed reprieve from the constant stress.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think I get it,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh? Get what?” Zelda asked curiously. What was his take on all this?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I prayed to Hylia that day. I asked her to guide my blade when I faced down the Warlord. I… said I would be her champion. It didn’t… didn’t quite work out like I imagined it should have,” he said, frowning. “But I think I see it now. We just have to have faith. This is all part of Hylia’s plan. Isn’t that right, Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your assessment is not inconsistent with the available data,” Fi said, floating to rest horizontally in the air. Zelda got the impression she was studying Link with intense scrutiny. “However, I am unable to provide further guidance on this matter. To the extent Hylia had plans for either of you, it is up to you to determine your next actions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And back again to the weighty topics. Zelda pondered on the many ideas and concerns floating around in her mind. There was so much she didn’t know, and Fi only raised more questions.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I was thinking,” Link said. “With the Sheikah out of service, maybe I should be the one to follow up on Vesyrn, the assassins, and all that? That actually sounds pretty in-line with my duties as the Queen’s Champion, yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did have a… wait—he said yes! <i>Yes, yes, yes, yes!</i> He accepted! —Well of course he accepted. How could he not after all of that? Zelda struggled to remain calm and collected. She smiled to herself, snatching up a fresh leaf of paper and penning out a writ. “I think that is a <i>wonderful</i> idea,” she said, barely able to contain herself. “Splendid. Most excellent. Oh, and Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Call me ‘Zelda,’ please. But only in private, of course.” She winked. She preferred keep some level of familiarity with those closest to her. She found it was much easier to deal with others when they treated her like a person, as opposed to some sort of abstract ideal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, Zelda,” Link said, face flush.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda finished the writ, folded the paper, and stamped it with her personal seal. “Here,” she said, handing it to him. “Take this to Chancellor Nyllara, the Queen’s Law. She’ll make it official.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded, accepting the missive. “Oh. Should I go now?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi?” Zelda asked. “Is there anything else pertinent to discuss with Link right now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative, Mistress,” Fi said. “I have conveyed all that was meant to be conveyed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link rose, bowing his head as he did.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded to him. “Thank you again, Link. I am certain we’ll speak again soon.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My pleasure to serve.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned to leave, and Zelda watched him go. His gaunt figure, the clack of his cane, and the way he favored one side as he walked served as a stark and painful reminder that he was still in recovery. What was she thinking, ordering him around in this state?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually!” she called after him, her pity getting the best of her. “I want you to rest for a few more days before getting to work. My sincerest apologies. I tend to get ahead of myself sometimes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stopped, turning back over his shoulder. “But, don’t I need to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I’ll get someone else on the task for now,” she said, waving. “Go. Get some rest. And make sure to eat. I’m sure you know already, but just ask any of the servants. They’ll bring anything you want up to your quarters.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded, looking equal parts relieved and disappointed. “Okay. Thank you, Zelda. I will.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link left, leaving her alone with a chromatic floating specter who had taken to dancing in circles on thin air. Zelda silently pondered what Fi got up to when she wasn’t manifesting herself. But, no—another time. She had enough to think about already.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi? I’d like to get started on my research, but still I have so many questions for you. Are you going to disappear on me again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative, Mistress," Fi said. “If you require further assistance or have additional questions, I will always be available, though in limited capacity."</span>
<br><br>
<span>“All… right,” Zelda said, watching as the specter faded abruptly from view, leaving her alone in her study.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She yawned and stretched, finishing off her wine. And Link’s too, for good measure. No use letting good wine go to waste. She had so much to think about. So many notes to go over. So much to do. And research! Where to begin?</span>

<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Some of the oldest folktales tell of a hidden race of people known as the Minish, who were so small as to be impossible to see with the naked eye. Legend has it that the people of Farwatch possessed a magical cap that allowed the wearer to shrink to minuscule sizes, thus allowing them to communicate with the Minish, who aided the kingdom in discovering traitors.</span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Cane of Byrna</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> An item of immense power, said to have been entrusted to the people of Byrna by Hylia herself when the Dominion of Byrna was founded. Legend says it was capable of deflecting magical attacks, invigorating its wielder, and protecting them from all harm.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Apparently it was used as a symbol of power and authority in the Old Kingdom and was lost following the Blin invasion. Notably, any mundane object imbued with enough magic can deflect magic attacks. But what’s with the other effects? Possibly worth following up on.</span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Lovers’ Rings</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> A pair of magical rings that was said to link the hearts and minds of true lovers together, allowing them to share thoughts and feelings even at great distances.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> While it’s possible items like these exist, I suspect it may just be a cover for use of fragments of Wisdom.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Basilisk’s Gaze</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> A common myth says that the Lightsworn of yore could freeze their enemies to stone with little more than a glance.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Although it’s well known that much magical lore has been lost to time, this ability doesn’t fit with our current understanding of the chromatic magics. Perhaps it was something entirely different? Or perhaps it never existed at all.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Frozen Armies</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Legends say that Hylia once descended from above and froze two entire armies in place until their leaders could agree to an armistice.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Could be linked to tales about the Basilisk’s Gaze?</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Lens of Truth</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> An artifact said to be used by the inquisitors of Farwatch to discover truth, make the incorporeal real, and pierce all illusion.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> ??? — I forget the source of this one, but always found it intriguing.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Rod of Seasons</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> A rod said to be able to control the weather and seasons. An old folktale says an evil king once used its magic to threaten his subjects into submission when they attempted to rebel.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Cultural references only, and not mentioned in any authoritative sources. How would something like this even work?!</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Pendant of Amethyst Sands</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> A pendant said to be worn by a powerful bloodmage named Moraga, who supposedly spearheaded the Gerudo rebellion. Legend has it the pendant gave her eternal life in exchange for the souls of those she killed.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Interesting, but likely little more than a scary tale told to children.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Champion’s Trials</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> A common element of many folktales. In them, a hero journeys far and wide, fighting wicked monsters, completing harrowing challenges, and unlocking their true potential as they earn the Goddesses’ favor.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> I find it odd that this is such a prevalent theme. Could there be something real behind it?</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Aghan’s Ring of Dominion</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> A ring that was said to put the wearer under the spell of its creator, forcing them to do their bidding. Allegedly used by Aghan, a senator of the Dominion of Byrna, to control and hold sway over his political opponents.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> A ring matching the exact description from a painting and that of several reliable historical accounts was confirmed and cataloged by the Order of Sages in year 171 of the Forsaken Era, but was subsequently lost. Their notes suggest the ring to be a completely mundane item. Perhaps its power had simply waned, or the source of Aghan’s ability was something else entirely. Or maybe it was all made up. Could this be related to the power of compels that Fi mentioned?</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Golden Gauntlets</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Gauntlets said to unlock the true strength of the wearer, allowing them to perform supernatural feats of strength.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Almost certainly a misdirection for use of fragments of Power, and a poor one at that.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Fae</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> The oldest folktales speak of marvelous and beautiful creatures known as Fae. In these grand tales, the Faerie Queen (for she always takes the appearance of a beautiful, scantily clad woman) presides over some village, blessing the lands with fertile soil and granting its peoples luck, happiness, and long life. In exchange, the people need only make humble offerings to maintain her favor, and thus ensure their continued prosperity.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> I’ve been meaning to look more into this. Curious how abruptly tales of and references to Fae fell out of favor.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Fire Rods, Ice Rods, Wind Rods</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Older tales commonly feature rods such as these that could channel magic directly. In these tales, the rods were usable even by those without magical affinity and without training.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Seems to be plausible, at least. Energy bursts are a well-known and widely used application of magic. To my knowledge, there is no known way of imbuing an object such that it can accomplish the same feat, but it’s entirely believable that the knowledge of how to do so has simply been lost, and yet to be rediscovered. (Though certainly not for lack of trying.)</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Zora’s Tunic</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Mentioned in a few folktales. In them, a hero is granted a magical tunic by the Zora people as thanks for his aid. Supposedly it allows for underwater breathing.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Who knows, where the Zora are concerned.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Sandals of Ascension</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Supposedly these winged sandals were a gift from Hylia to Queen Nialay Proventia Zelda Hyrule I of Farwatch. They were said to allow the queen to ascend into the sky and speak directly with the Holy Mother.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> ??? — All manner of nonsense can be found if you go back far enough. I hesitate to include this one, and only do so because it is also well known that Nialay was a prominent Lightsworn and a direct descendant of Hylia.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Hero of Storms / Gale Boomerang</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Folklore / Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> A common folktale tells of a hero who could hurl boomerangs with such ferocity that they could calm storms and disperse rains. In the story, the hero uses this power to defeat a gigantic sea serpent that terrorized the coastlands. In some versions this was the hero’s own power, and in others it was that of a magical boomerang.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> No idea. Only including this due to its uniqueness.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> Soulsteel</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Some accounts of the Blin invasion refer to terrible voidspawn bearing weapons made of "soulsteel." They claim the most powerful of Blin warriors forged these weapons from their own souls, and that any wounds inflicted by them would never heal. Some accounts further claim that these weapons could effortlessly cleave through even the toughest metal.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> This is almost certainly little more than the result of embellishment and hyperbole stemming from accounts of bloodrage that grew over the ages.</span>
<span><hr></span>
<span><b><u>Item:</u> </b> The Master Sword</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u> </b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u> </b> Also known as "The Sword of Evil’s Bane." A common element in many legends; said to have the power to seal away darkness and banish evil. Legend says that only a true hero can wield it—any others would immediately die upon touching it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Some stories say the hero who stood against the hordes at the Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess bore this very blade, and further claim it was the only weapon capable of countering soulsteel.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u> </b> Note that the reference to the hero’s stand is indeed an actual historical event which took place around the year 508 of the Forsaken Era. The fall of the temple is widely regarded by historians as the symbolic and final end of the Old Kingdom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But a sword that destroys evil? How absurd. How could a sword tell the difference between good and evil? I hesitate to include this one, except for the reference to countering soulsteel. Now that I know magic is capable of curing bloodrage, perhaps this merits further investigation.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The sound of raised voices stirred Zelda from her slumber. Ugh. She had such a headache. And to her dismay, one of her reading candles had melted down to ruin a page of <i>Ithin’s Tales</i>. Now she would need to…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Wait. Oh, damnation—what time was it? She scrambled from her chair to peek through the shutters. The midday sun sent nearly her reeling. “Gahh!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick. Fick, fick, fick, fick! She was late for court—by an hour at least. Adresin had taken up charge of the northern forces, and Nyllara had been tasked to oversee reconstruction efforts, leaving her as the only official who could legally call the proceedings to order.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She hurried over to a basin, splashing water in her face and rubbing it clean with a washcloth, then gave herself a once-over in its reflection. Not her best day. Her hair had gotten tangled, but she managed to hide the worst of it by pulling it into a tail. Okay. She could do this, she just needed to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The door to the hallway below burst open. “<i>Zelda!</i> Get your Royal Highness down here this instant!” came the voice of Countess Lensa. Zelda winced. She really wasn’t doing herself any favors today.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Coming, coming!” she called, making her way down the stairs. “I’m so sorry, Lensa. I just got caught up in research, and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I <i>don’t</i> need to hear it, Your Grace. Just… ugh. Look. You have <i>responsibility</i> now. You can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know, I know,” Zelda said, throwing her hands in the air in defeat. “I’ll do better. I promise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa sighed, looking around. “Where’s your handmaiden?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anli? I don’t know. I haven’t seen her since—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Whatever,” Lensa said, rubbing her temple. “It doesn’t matter. I’ll send one from my house for you. Just…” She stood stiff, hands on hips, looking Zelda over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt like her face could burst into flames at any moment. Why was she so bad at this? Why had the Goddesses deemed fit to curse her so?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Your Grace, thank you for hearing me. With the destruction of the eastern fiefdoms, we’ve been absolutely <i>inundated</i> with refugees. And House Kah has done <i>far more</i> than others in our duty to lodge and care for the underprivileged. We’ve had fourteen violent crimes on our property this week alone! And just this morning I had to order the execution of a poor beggar boy who injured one of my guardsman in an attempt to steal from my grain stores…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“To summarize: with the supply lines disrupted,” the merchant continued, “we simply cannot be expected to meet our quota this month. Your Grace, I’m afraid I <i>cannot</i> continue to operate at cost like this. We need a remission on the tariffs, or we risk having to declare insolvency…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“As you all well know, the frost came early this year," the farmer said, holding his hat before him as he spoke. “And we’re still struggling from the bad yields last year. And of course we all know the taxes must be paid—no doubt. No doubt. But we’ve heard tell of your Greeneries, Your Grace, and we were hoping you might come and bless our crops…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda skimmed over the charges. Abandoning post. Theft of martial supplies. Assaulting a guardsman. Blasphemy. Insulting the Royal Family. …Wearing improper attire to court? She rubbed at her forehead. Who even made these laws?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do you plead?” she asked, woefully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Guilty, Your Grace. I have confessed my sins before the Mother, and now seek atonement,” the soldier said, falling to his knees. “Please, Your Grace! Please, have mercy!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sighed, paging through the papers. The penalty for desertion was usually death, but the kingdom really couldn’t spare the luxury of making examples at present. Blasphemy meant branding or even removal of the tongue depending on severity. Assault varied based on one’s station, the station of their victim, and the nature of the offense. Insulting the Crown meant twenty lashings and a day in the stocks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked him over. By all appearances, he was just some scared and angry kid who lost his nerve and went on to make some bad choices. No one was actually harmed by his actions—Hylia least of all. Well, except for the guardsman he had given a black eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She glanced over to Taetus, who eyed her fixedly. He was expecting a firm punishment, no doubt. Lensa refused to meet her eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought. Why not solve two problems at once?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well,” she said. “You are hereby stripped of all lands, ranks, titles, and holdings. You will serve six years of indentured servitude to House Kah, and are to abide by all lawful orders from your new master.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you! Thank you, Your Grace!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dannek,” Zelda said, turning to the older noble at the side of the room. “Is this arrangement acceptable?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He bowed, clasping his hands. “Yes, Your Grace. Thank you. I will put him to good use.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“I’m afraid morale has never been worse,” the bishop said. “Your people are fearful for their lives, their property, their family, their <i>children</i>. Most of the crimes have not been committed out of malice or disdain for the law, but merely out of fear and uncertainty. Surely you can see this? I beg you, Your Grace. Please, you need only let them know the Crown is looking out for them…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“I haven’t anything to request of you, Your Grace,” the wounded soldier said. He prostrated himself before her—as best as he was able with his arm in a splint.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have only come to thank you for saving the kingdom,” he said, reverently. “Thank you, my Queen. Without you, I and so many others would be dead, or worse. Praise be unto Hylia!” he shouted. The room echoed his cry. “Praise be unto Queen Zelda, her champion!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blushed. She couldn’t help but smile. She dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. It made her happy to know that at least some of her subjects were appreciative. “You are most welcome, sir,” she said, motioning for the room to settle. “Please, rise. And know that the Crown is grateful for your service. As ever, I act only for the good of our people, and for the kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, Your Grace,” the man said. He struggled to his feet, and a younger man came to his aid. Zelda motioned for the next petitioner, but the soldier stood his ground. “As you well know,” he said, continuing to address her, “we still fight to contain and push back the Blight. <i>Pray tell</i>, Your Grace. When will you be joining us on the front?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scoffed, caught off guard by his brazen audacity and the sudden shift in tone. Another voice cried out: “Yeah, when?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Council chambers erupted. Zelda sat, stunned. What could she say? They clearly believed her to be capable of much more than she actually was. Was it prudent to publicly admit her own weakness? What of their enemies? Dare she tell them about the fate of Hylia?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Order!” Lensa demanded. “The chamber will come to order! That is enough for today—bailiff, please clear the floor."</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“The southern forces are moving to contain further ingress from Talus, but the fighting is still fierce around the floodplains,” Wymar informed them. “As you all know, Adresin has already left with an advance force, and I am soon to leave with the remainder.” He turned to Zelda. “Your Grace, I would not request this if it weren’t dire. But we need every able body we can muster.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda didn’t like the sound of that—not at all. “What is it, Lord General?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We still have the problem of the Sheikah,” he said. “With your permission, I’d like to use them to bolster our forces. We can send the most unproven among them to serve on the front lines.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Granted,” she said. It was an unorthodox request, but entirely reasonable.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And half the Royal Guard,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?!” Zelda said. She was still under threat from assassins, and she barely had two hundred guardsmen left to defend the castle! “No, Wymar, I can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know, Your Grace. I know,” he said, gesturing with one hand. “As I said, I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t think the need urgent. But they’re among the best fighters we have available, and every veteran sword we can field improves our odds. For now, I would recommend you retreat to Kakariko. We can better insure your safety there, and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Are you mad?” Lensa interrupted. “Unthinkable! The Queen herself abandoning the city, at a time like this? The people would be calling for <i>all</i> our heads! We can’t have it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“With respect, Countess,” Wymar snapped, “I will leave the decision with our queen.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook herself. She could see the sense of it both ways. Still, she had no idea what to decide here. “I’ll… let me think about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar and Lensa both nodded. Neither looked happy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another councilor spoke up. Roldath? Or was it Rissu? “Your Grace, Bishop Olo made a fine point. If you can find the time, I urge you to meet with your people. I would be happy to draft up some words for you. A few speeches, a few personal meetings with the Noble Houses? It will go a long way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you,” Zelda said. “Yes, please do so. I’ll see what I can do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace?” Taetus. Zelda mentally readied herself for what was to come.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Counselor?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do not wish to put too fine a point to it, but you have so many matters to attend to at present. With Nyllara and Adresin otherwise predisposed, perhaps it would be prudent for myself or Countess Oda to be granted temporary powers to administer court when you are not available? At least until the current situation improves.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That <i>ficking</i> snake. Ever looking for another opportunity to expand his influence. But if she was being honest with herself, she would appreciate the reprieve. Somehow, that made it all the worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” she said, exasperated. “Write up the writ and get it to me by the morrow.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you,” he said. “Oh, and one more matter, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Out with it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus smiled, shaking his head ruefully. “There was a message delivered to Last Bastion by a lone Gerudo rider. It was addressed to you personally.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned. What could that be?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus unrolled a parchment, reading it aloud. “I come bearing a message for the new queen. The Lynx offers you her aid, and the Sunseekers will stand to call. Allow us to lend our assistance to our long-lost siblings in these dark times. Send a rider on a white horse with your reply.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finished, he rolled up and tucked away the message. Whispers and laughter broke out in the small chamber. “The Lynx?” he asked, curiously. “Odd—very odd. Does this mean anything to you, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated. She wasn’t sure how much to speak of this—and she wasn’t sure who could be trusted with the information. She tapped at her chin, scanning the room. Taetus caught her eye, and she looked away. “I’m not certain, Councilor. Thank you for the information. I’ll get back to you on that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Back on the clearing and reconstruction efforts, if I may,” someone said. “I would like to motion for—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Excuse me,” Zelda interrupted, lost in thought. “Thank you all, but I need to retire for now. There is so much on my mind, and so many decisions to be made. Counselor Taetus, you have the floor.”</span>
<br><br>
