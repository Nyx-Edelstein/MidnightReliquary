<span>“Zelda?” came Sera’s voice. “It’s time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a deep breath, letting it out in a long sigh. On some level she was relieved; she had been dreading this all day. For the past several days, even. She found it hard to take pleasure in anything, knowing what was ahead. A black stormcloud of despair and sorrow loomed on the horizon, inching steadily closer. Unavoidable. Inevitable. Hiding away in her study did nothing to hasten its approach, nor prolong what she knew was coming. No part of her wanted to go through it, yet every part of her wanted it to be over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She made to respond to Sera, but found herself at a loss for words. Instead, she stood and knocked back the last of her wine. She settled for nodding to the girl, then picked up the parcel on her desk, holding it tightly to her chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sera stepped aside and Zelda took the lead. The younger girl carried with her a brooch and a small flower. Zelda wanted to ask about their significance, but she couldn’t bring herself to. She would learn soon enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two of them made their way out of the study, past the guards and down the hall. Their footsteps echoed faintly against the walls, joined by the rustling of arms and armor as her detail fell in behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Step. Step. Step. Time inched forward at its own pace; inexorable, and heedless of her plight. Every step was a chore. She wanted so badly for it to just be over. Would but that she could just run away and hide somewhere until it was. But she knew that was ridiculous. She was Queen; she had to fulfill her duty. She had no choice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She tried not to dwell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At last they made it to the castle antechamber. Zelda and her small entourage made their way down the stairs and to the fore of the gathered crowd. She scanned their faces. Few eyes met her own, but every pair of hands held <i>something</i>. She knew she was not alone in her feelings and apprehension, but somehow that made it worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wordlessly, she halted and faced the exit, allowing the congregation to file in behind her. The magnificent stone doors were drawn open, and the High Priestess took up position to her right. Zelda met her eyes. The aging woman nodded to her solemnly. She nodded back, and together the two of them led the procession in its march.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And so they marched. Through the doorway. Across the gardens, bathed in the light of Nia above. Along the winding path to the western edge of the castle grounds, and finally atop the knoll where the ceremonial pyre had been prepared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They came to a halt and the procession fanned out to either side. Zelda passed her parcel to Vestele and took up the torch offered to her from a guardsman to her left. She approached the pyre and paused to look out over her city. Utter darkness. Not a single light to be found.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She steeled herself. With a breath, she tossed the torch onto the pyre and was met with a sudden <i>fwoosh</i> as the oiled wood went up in a blaze. Zelda shielded her face from the intense wave of heat, stepping back to a comfortable distance. She looked again over the city. One by one, lights sprang up in the darkness; others following her lead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Tonight, every soul in Hyrule would be united in this ritual. Joined together, on this day of Remembrance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She returned to the High Priestess. The woman undid the ribbon of Zelda’s parcel and knelt, presenting the items inside to her queen.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Easy</i>, Zelda thought to herself as her eyes began to sting at the edges. She paused to get control her breathing. <i>This is the easy part. You can do this.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She took the first item: a guardsman’s tunic. Her hands passed over its rough surface as she recalled the horrific events of that day. “Esosh,” she said loudly, projecting her voice so that it would be heard clearly over the crackling of the pyre. She unsheathed a knife at her side and began to cut a long strip of fabric from the chest. Somewhere to her right, his widow cried out in mourning. Zelda blinked back the tears and forced herself to continue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finished, she sheathed the knife and left the strip behind, taking the tunic in hand. Three steps backward, and she addressed the crowd; dozens of downcast faces, somber and mirthless. Shadows danced around them to the light of the fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Esosh was a brave and loyal soldier of the Royal Guard,” she proclaimed. “He was a loving husband and father. And four days ago, he gave his life to protect mine. Our kingdom is worse for his passing, and we will never again know his like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned back to the pyre and its all-too-eager flames. Stepping forward, she scrunched the tunic into a ball. And with a kiss, she tossed it into the waiting inferno. Within moments, it was utterly consumed.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “He is lost, but not forgotten,” she said. The crowd repeated her words in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Back to Vestele. Zelda continued the rite, trying hard not to let herself be affected overmuch by the sobbing of Esosh’s widow. Methodical. Rote. She took the strip of fabric she had cut away, along with a winged emblem made of pure silver; the symbol of the Crown, of her family. It was the highest honor she could bestow to the fallen soldier and <i>his</i> family. She wound the fabric tightly around the emblem and made her way to the grieving widow. There, she fell to her knees in the dirt before the woman, holding the offering outstretched above her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am honored, Your Grace” the woman managed between sobs, taking the offering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine,” Zelda replied, completing the rite. She stood, feeling relieved to be that much closer to the end. But before she could turn to leave, she met the reddened eyes of a small child hiding behind her mother’s skirts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her breath caught in her throat and she glanced up at the moon overhead. It was too much—<i>Mother’s mercy</i>, but it was too much. What had this child done to deserve losing her father like this? She dropped back to her knees, taking the girl in her arms. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, ragged. “I am so, so sorry.” She held the child to her bosom. They were joined by the mother, and together they wept.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt a hand on her shoulder and she looked up. Link. She nodded, kissed at the foreheads of the mother and child, then rose and returned once more to Vestele. Another tunic. Another name. “Mora,” Zelda called, going through the same motions as before. Another strip of fabric. Another set of voices crying out into the abyss.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mora was a brave and loyal woman of the Royal Guard,” she said. “A consummate heroine; she brought pride and honor to her family. Four days ago, she risked her life to protect mine, and was taken from us well before her time. Our kingdom is worse for her passing, and we will never again know her like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda tossed Mora’s tunic into the flames as before. “She is lost, but not forgotten,” she chanted, and the crowed echoed her. Another emblem. Another offering. Zelda fell to her knees in the dirt before the woman’s father.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We are honored, Your Grace," the elderly man said as he received the offering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine,” Zelda said, rising.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She met his eyes. He smiled, brushing away a tear. “It’s okay," he said softly, clasping her shoulder. “She’s with the Mother now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda only nodded to him, doing her best to return the smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All too soon, she found herself in front of Vestele again. The honors done, she now faced the hardest part of the ceremony; next was Father. Though, she found it wasn’t as difficult as she imagined it would be. Perhaps it was the catharsis of consoling others in their grief, or perhaps she had already worked through the worst of it already. It certainly ached, but it did not sting as she pried the gemstone loose from Father’s signet ring.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“King Gaillard Stefanus Hyrule, the Fourth!" she bellowed, feeling a swelling of pride as she raised her voice for all to hear. Several in the crowd stamped their feet. Zelda smiled to herself. It felt good to say his name like that. It felt good to honor him before the crowd. “My father,” she continued. “He was a great man, and a great leader. All loved him. All respected him.” She hesitated. The words were wrong, but she had to say it. She couldn’t <i>not</i>. “I pray to the Mother that I might be so fortunate as to follow in his footsteps. Our kingdom is worse for his passing, and we will never again know his like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Turning to the pyre, she held the gemstone up to its light. The whole world felt surreal. Fake. Flimsy. Like it would crumble upon itself with the slightest breeze. How could any of this be real? How could <i>his</i> kingdom continue without <i>him</i>? How had anyone ever expected her to live up to his name? Weeks after his death, and she still boggled at the thought of taking his place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He is lost, but not forgotten,” Zelda said reverently, tossing the gemstone into the fire. “I will miss you, Father,” she added, sliding the now-empty ring onto her left index finger. Her hand found its way to her mother’s locket.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stood there for what seemed like an eternity, gazing into the flames. She couldn’t bring herself to go back for the final rite. She couldn’t say goodbye. Not yet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link was again at her side. Zelda shook her head. “Later,” she mouthed. He nodded, and she wandered off from the gathered masses, finding a quiet place atop an outcropping of rock a few dozen feet away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She listened intently as names were called out by the others, one by one. Seth. Grace. Mama. Papi. Duvar. Emma. Esto. Gren. Raolin. Veldas. Rorrith. Isa. Nen. Sabor. Geoff. Gruss. Maple. Jeoff. Dacey. Raso. Edith. Berro. Alli. Nasso. Mela. Karra. Cavin. Koth. Every one of them was someone’s mother; father; sister; brother; cousin; uncle; aunt; friend; lover; partner. Lost, every one of them. They had disappeared into the endless night, but they would live on in the hearts and minds of all they left behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much death. So much loss. She looked out over the city. Dozens of fires. Tens of thousands of names, it had to be. The sheer scale of it was staggering. Sobering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link joined her after a time. Together they sat in companionable silence, well into the night. A tacit understanding passed between them; it went wholly without saying. <i>Never again</i>. Never again could there be another night like this.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Hours passed, and the moon shone brightly overhead. The crowd had thinned considerably. Only a few remained. Vestele. Link. Several Zelda couldn’t name. Taetus, of all people. She tried not to pay them any mind as she returned for the last item in her parcel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She knelt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A black shawl trimmed in gold, bearing the silver eye of the Sheikah. Zelda took it, holding it close to her chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Impa</i>,” she whispered. “I loved you. You were the family I never had. You were perfect. You were my light. My shining star. The one who always stood by me, no matter what. I always trusted you to have my back. I always looked to you for guidance. I always knew you would be there for me.“</span>
<br><br>
<span>The pain and grief welled up again, and she couldn’t hold it back any longer. She sobbed, tears streaming freely down her face and over her lips. She found it hard to breathe, but held nothing back. She buried her face in the shawl and wept, letting her pain bleed out into the world.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And now you’re not,” she said in broken gasps. “Now, you are gone.” She clutched the shawl tightly, not wanting it to be final. Not wanting to let go, but knowing she had to. “I miss you, Impa. I miss you so much. Why did you have to leave me? Why did you have to go?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t right.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>It wasn’t right.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stood, unsheathing her knife and cutting out the segment of cloth around the silver eye. She turned to the pyre. It was still going, though its intensity had waned considerably. She approached and threw the rest of the shawl onto its embers while she still had the strength to do so.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You are lost,” she whispered. “But you are not forgotten. I will never forget you.”</span>
<br><br>
