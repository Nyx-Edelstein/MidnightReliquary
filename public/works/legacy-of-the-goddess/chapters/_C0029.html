<span>The door swung open, and a man wearing a Gerudo shawl over plain cotton clothing was ushered through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please, have a seat,” a guardsman said. “The Inquisitor will be with you soon.”</span>
<br><br>		
<span>Zelda turned her head fractionally to the side in inquiry. She and Laylith were disguised as regular guardsmen, blending in with four other soldiers standing watch along the far wall of a moderately-sized bedroom on the third floor of the east wing of the castle.
</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Malg</i>, came Laylith’s voice via Telepathy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah. Right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Though, that only left her with more questions. Everything about this interrogation ran contrary to her expectations. Here this man—an agent of the enemy—was being offered tea and biscuits as he sat in a cozy chair in front of a warm hearth, next to a window overlooking the castle gardens. They weren’t worried about him escaping—there were at least a dozen soldiers covering every conceivable exit route, and the castle was on lockdown besides. Still, it was a far cry from the bleak and sinister torture chamber in the deepest, darkest dungeon in the kingdom that Zelda had in mind for this wretch when she was first informed of his capture.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>But no! Rather than torture, they seemed to be intent on making the man as comfortable and welcome as possible.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda studied the traitor. He was stiff and fidgety. If they were trying to make him comfortable, it seemed to be having the opposite effect. Or perhaps this was the intent?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Whatever. As long as it got results. If Malg believed this to be the most effective way of getting information and gaining the spy’s cooperation, then so be it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>For Zelda’s part, she wanted more insight into their enemy. She wanted to know firsthand the mind of an individual who willingly served evil. Did he believe his cause just, or was he being coerced? Was he a good man, simply misguided, or was he a crazed zealot, hell-bent on destruction? Had he been lied to and fed false promises by his master, or did he know the true extent of the dark powers he served? She needed to know, and some things you had to see for yourself. No condensed, dry report could be a substitute for her own eyes and ears.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Having Fi around to study him during the questioning was only a plus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And so, she insisted on being present for this interrogation, despite both Malg’s and Laylith’s insistence to the contrary. Eventually they gave up on attempting to dissuade her, on the condition that she remain silent and not attempt to interfere no matter what. Terms she gladly agreed to. Any information from Fi would have to wait until afterward, or towards the end.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had been told their methods might not be what she was expecting, and at the time she thought they were trying to spare her a gruesome experience. Now, she was beginning to see a different picture: Clearly, they feared her losing her temper and threatening the man, or worse, sabotaging their efforts.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hrmph.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…But sure, she could understand their worries, even if it stung a bit. Zelda had certainly managed to cultivate a reputation as a hothead in particular circumstances, even if in more recent times she had come to understand and regret such behavior. Perhaps on a bad day she might be tempted to give in to baser urges, but today was not such a day. In fact, she felt a sense of calm and ease as they waited for Malg to arrive.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t much longer before he did. As the older man entered—wearing what looked to be Magistrate’s robes (curious)—the spy sat upright, clearly doing his best to look stern and unyielding as he raised his chin in defiance. He attempted to make eye contact, but Malg simply ignored the man as he sat down across from him and unwrapped the twine of a leather binder. He thumbed through the parchments it contained, pausing to scan some over before either placing them back inside or setting them on the small table between the two.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda couldn’t make out what any of it said from this distance, but the writing was neat, meticulous, and precise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know what game you’re playing at, but you’re not getting anything from me," the spy said in perfect Hylian—not even the barest hint of an accent. “Just kill me already and be done with it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg continued to ignore him as he went about his task. Finished, he set the binder aside and made a show of squaring the loose parchments against the table. He then let out a long sigh and relaxed into his chair, setting one leg atop the other. “We are not going to kill you, Dranderval.” Malg looked the man over, then clasped his hands and opened his mouth before closing it again. “…Is that really your name? You can tell me if it isn’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The spy stared back at him with lips drawn to a line. Half a minute passed, and neither of them broke eye contact or so much as moved a muscle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The spy broke first, licking his lips. “That is my name, yes. My true name, given to me by my father on the day of my birth. I swear it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>He is sincere, came Fi’s voice.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg nodded. “I see. Thank you for the clarification.” He leaned forward to dip a quill to ink and made a note, then paged through the parchments again. A shrug and another sigh. “Well, if you aren’t willing to talk, I suppose we’re done here,” he said, standing and reaching for the binder. “I’ll see to it you are properly fed and quartered, along with Ravelo and Kimuse. And once we’ve won the—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Kimuse? Is she—” Dranderval said before catching himself. “No. No—I’m not going to fall for your tricks, <i>Hylian</i>. If she’s still alive I’ll see it for myself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry?” Malg turned and cocked his head slightly. “Ah, I understand your confusion. Apologies: I misspoke. You will not be quartered <i>with</i> them. That would present far too much of a risk. What I meant to say was—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Lies!</i>” the man bellowed, smacking the arms of his chair as he leaned forward. His chest visibly rose and fell with each breath. The guards beside her leveled their spears, and Zelda placed a hand on the hilt of her sword so as to not look out of place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg held up a hand. Steady.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A few tense seconds later, he sat back down, leaning forward on the edge of his seat. “I know what this looks like, Dranderval,” he said. “Believe me, I do.” He shook his head and held out an open palm. “But whatever you have been led to believe, we are not savages. Prisoners of war you may be, but in Hyrule we treat such prisoners with dignity and respect, as befits all children of Hylia. Why, to do otherwise would be an affront to the Mother herself! But you don’t have to take my word for it. You can read our scripture. Our laws.” He pulled open the drawer of the end table next to his chair, reached inside, and tossed the spy a scroll. “Shall I fetch Her Grace, the Queen, to tell you the same? Or perhaps the Queen’s word is not good enough for you, and you’d like to hear it from the mouth of the High Priestess instead? I could arrange it. Or you could just look around you and see for yourself I’m telling the truth.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>The spy fumed, shifting several times in his seat before crossing his arms and staring into the fire. His leg bounced jitterily.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Holy Mother Above, Malg’s a good liar</i>, Zelda found herself thinking. She was glad for the visor hiding her face from view, otherwise she would have certainly given something away. Where was he going with this?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So what?” Dranderval said. “In exchange for information, you let me see her? Is that it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suppose that could be arranged,” Malg said with an exaggerated frown and shrug. “What did you have in mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The spy gaped back at him with a look of sheer bewilderment. “What kind of fool do you take me for?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg shook his head and threw out a hand in a placating gesture. “You’re the one who suggested it. Not I,” he said, letting a touch of frustration into his voice. He cleared his throat and reached for the parchments, paging through them with a scowl. “Look, I get it,” he said. “As men of war, we both know that war is messy. In war, people get hurt. Sometimes innocent people. In fact…” A long pause. He let his eyes fall to the far wall. “In my experience, it’s mostly innocent people. Now—my job is to ensure as few innocent people as possible get hurt. And if you want to help me with that…?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>He set the papers down and steepled his hands, setting his chin upon his thumbs. “We know Ganondorf was behind the Blin. And Ja’bu. And we know about the next attack, and we’re not going to be caught off guard this time. We know his ultimate goal, we know the power he serves, and we know he is collecting fragments of the Triforce. And as you well know—despite yours and your comrades’ attempts at sabotage—we have killed the third and final Warlord and are, as we speak, cleaning up the last remnants of the Blight. Once we are done with the Blin, we will turn the full attention of the Sheikah to finding the Exiled King and putting an end to him, permanently. As for fragments of Power, with the help of the Gorons we have recovered two fragments in addition to the one we already held and have ordered companies of our best men with our best ships to set sail for the furthest reaches of the world with the fragments in their possession, and not a single soul knows of their destinations. If by some miraculous turn of events we do not find and kill your master, he will die of old age before he recovers even one of those three! And! Once we are done with the Blight, the Lord General will march an army across the desert, to Kamorh and Selseib, and we will conquer your broken nation of squabbling hill-Kings and bandit tribes, and <i>when that is done!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg paused to take a deep breath and sit back, going from angry and impassioned back to calm and composed in the space of two seconds flat. “When that is done, and if you choose to make yourself useful to me, then perhaps you and your comrades can go home to your families in peace. Think about it. You have nothing left to fight for, Dranderval. I think you’d be surprised to know what Ravelo has already told me. Or perhaps you wouldn’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused to look over the other man, pale-faced, silent, and still. “So?” Malg asked. “What did you have in mind? And what is it you need from me in return? I think you will find that I can be very accommodating.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Just checking, but none of that was true, right?” Zelda asked Laylith in the hall as she unfastened and removed her helmet on the way out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not much of it, no,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Could’ve fooled me,” Zelda said. “Had me wondering if I completely blanked on a month of reports.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What can I say?” Laylith shrugged. “He’s the best at what he does.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress,” Fi said, her form materializing from the aether. “After observing Malg during the interrogation, I am pleased to report that I have significantly refined my understanding of the Hylian capacity for intentional deception. I can now state with confidence that Malg was lying to you when he said he regretted the necessity of torture. Also when he said he wanted to spare you the mental anguish of continued observation of such ‘horrific acts,’ as he phrased it. Also when he said he said he did not wish to hurt anyone, and also—”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I get it, Fi! I get it.” Zelda put her hands up, waving the specter away. “Thank you, but that’s enough for now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She felt her stomach turn. She had always thought there was something off about that man, but…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She winced as she heard the spy’s cries of pain echo throughout the halls. As it turned out, she did not in fact have the stomach for that kind of thing. She had intended to stick around to the end, hoping perhaps Fi could continue to pick out which if any details were true and worth following up on, but Malg insisted she leave before it got any worse. He wasn’t likely to get more useful information out of the man, he said, but he had to try.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda decided she did not want to think about the ramifications of Fi’s statements. Someone had to do the job, and she supposed Malg was as good a man as any for it. </span>
<br><br>
<span>The meat of the information gleaned was that Ganondorf had taken inspiration from Hyrule and began his own program to rival the Sheikah nearly twenty years ago. It made sense, and slotted neatly into place given everything else they had learned: the bombs from Talus, the assassination attempt, the spy they captured when leaving for Last Bastion, and a dozen-odd happenings that were previously unexplained. Shesan conjectured that Ganondorf would have agents searching for fragments, probing their defenses, and interfering with operations; now they all but had confirmation of her theory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Yiga Clan, they called themselves. Harbingers of a new age. Zealots who believed wholeheartedly in the cause of uniting the world through conquest, with their leader Gannondorf at the helm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Or so it would seem. Dranderval had given up the names and previous known locations of four additional agents, as well as divulging that eight of their order had been killed or captured—that he knew of (including the two he thought still safe). This was not counting several other tidbits of information that Zelda confirmed with Fi to be complete bogus. And that was well before Malg chose to reveal the rest of his hand, so to speak.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You okay, dearie?” Laylith.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head. They did try to talk her out of it. “I’ll be fine. Just need to keep moving. What’s next on my schedule?”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda stood on the castle parapets, looking over Castletown. A stiff breeze blew in from the city, carrying mostly-unpleasant scents, along with an unexpected chill for so early in the afternoon. She shuddered and pulled her jacket tight. The weather of First Flows was often unpredictable, ranging from hot, muggy, oppressive rainstorms to light dustings of snow sometimes even towards the end of the month. This morning, every indication had been that it would be a fair day. Alas.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She searched for anything she could think of to occupy her mind. She didn’t want to go back inside just yet. Inside was back to more paperwork, back to more politics. Not that she was thinking about anything in particular—more, her mind was so cluttered and her thoughts so jumbled, she needed to take a break from it all and unwind. It didn’t help that she was currently lacking in options for places to think in solitude. Just yesterday, some conceited trainee managed to shoot an arrow through the window of her study after boasting to his peers that he could clear the castle with his shot. Thankfully no one was injured, but the entire window needed to be replaced, and there was no way she could think with all that racket going on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Idly, she wondered if things would ever get back to normal.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Normal.</i> What even was “normal,” anyway? Had her life ever been normal? Come to think of it, was anyone’s life ever “normal,” or was it that people got used to how things were? For her, it seemed like every time—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda, a moment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ugh. She turned to find Shesan approaching. Zelda took in a breath, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry—good news this time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda arched an eyebrow. “Really?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded as she strode up beside her and leaned out onto the parapet. “Best news we’ve had in a while, actually. Vesyrn just contacted me, and I’ve come to report that he and Allanah have recovered two fragments of Wisdom. I would say ‘unmitigated success’ if not for the fact that half the team was lost. They’re not out of the woods just yet, but it’s looking good.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s eyes went wide. “<i>Two</i> fragments?!” She could barely believe—“Wait, lost?! Half the team? What in damnation happened out there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan grunted in frustration. “Would it surprise you to learn that there’s a secret order of warrior monks living out in the ruins of Byrna?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blinked. That was clearly a rhetorical question. “Um. Yes. Actually I find that highly surprising. <i>Warrior monks?</i> How long have they been out there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, our team didn’t exactly have an opportunity to ask, but every indication is they’ve been there this whole time,” Shesan answered. “Apparently the monks had been tracking them since day one, and were leading them into an ambush by planting clues for the team to follow. The Sheikah caught on to them a couple days in advance and had time to prepare, but given the situation and how deep they were in the monks’ territory, they had few other options than to play into it. It was a slaughter, but we came out on top.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said heavily. She paced back and forth as she processed the information. “That’s… horrible. I would have hoped we could have worked something out. How many on their side…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Over a dozen,” Shesan said. “And two of their leaders. The monks surrendered when it was apparent they weren’t going to win.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda winced. “So I am to assume that further diplomacy is out of the question?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For the time being, yes, that seems to be the case,” Shesan said. “Four Sheikah, however skilled, aren’t going to be able to hold ground against a tribe of unknown size in unfamiliar territory. They’ve retreated for now, with two captives in tow to ensure their safe passage. It’s far from over, but Vesyrn doesn’t believe they’re being followed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They should make for Hylia’s Watch immediately,” Zelda said. “I’ll send a missive out with this evening’s batch for an advance party to meet them halfway and escort them back to safety.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My thoughts exactly,” Shesan said. “I’ll pass the word along.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head, crossing her arms. “It’s just… such a shame. An opportunity wasted. There’s so much we could have learned! Artifacts, history, magical knowledge!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And yet more brave souls who had given their lives in service to the kingdom. More families to honor, more lives to remember. An ever-expanding list, it seemed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wow,” Shesan tilted her head to the sky with a short laugh. “I can’t believe I’m the optimistic one for a change. We’ll soon have six fragments of Wisdom to the enemy’s five of Power, with three other shards in our possession besides. We now control a full <i>third</i> of the Triforce, Zelda! Not the right third, mind you, but a third nonetheless. The sooner we can get clarity on your dreams—by the gods, we might actually do this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked her over. It was unnerving to see the woman in good spirits. She understood the perspective, but did she have to be so… callous? “I suppose you’re right,” she said after a moment. “And I suppose there’s nothing stopping us from going back to Byrna later with a larger, more prepared force. Perhaps with peace offerings, to try and make amends?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh, maybe,” Shesan said, waving a hand from side to side. “Though I wouldn’t count on it. To hear Vesyrn tell it, it was quite the bloodbath. Horrific, really. Now I’m not saying it’s impossible, but you are facing an uphill battle considering that the most likely purpose of their secret order was to safeguard the shards, which we just waltzed in and stole from them; killing their leaders in the process. Just saying: mortal enemies have been minted over lesser grievances.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda groaned. She felt sick to her stomach and buried her face in her hands. She took a moment to process, then let out a breath and stood up straight. “No, you’re right. What’s done is done. We’ll just have to figure it out from here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another item to toss onto the mountainous pile of “urgent things in need of handling, preferably sooner rather than later”: vengeful monks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan only shrugged, apparently having nothing else to add to the subject. “Well, that’s all from me,” she said. “Unless you had anything?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually, I did have one question,” Zelda said, raising a finger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded, turning to lean against the near wall. “Go on, I’m listening.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think you could locate the Blin from my dreams?” she asked. “Ildram, the ‘Sage.’ I don’t know what all is involved in the process, but given he’s had direct dealings with Ja’bu and Demise, my thinking was that whatever you did to help locate the Warlord’s camp could at least point us in the right direction. After that, I could requisition however many mages I need to top off my magic while I scry the distance.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No need,” Shesan said, raising a finger and pointing east.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed her skeptically. “…I didn’t mean—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve already done basically that. There’s a Blin ‘monastery’ in the hills northwest of the ruins of Farwatch,” Shesan said. “Even odds Ildram is the one in charge there, or by digging around you’ll find your way to him. The location is too exposed, though. No way we’re getting a small team across the plains without running into who knows how many bands of Blin. My current plan is a naval route along the coast, but that poses its own problems.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She cleared her throat. “And before you ask, I was planning to bring it up at the next strategy meeting. There’s nothing to be done until our collective assets have been given a chance to recuperate from the current round of ventures.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, taking it all in. “I… Thank you. That’s quite helpful. You’re right—we’ll need to strategize.” She tapped a finger to her chin. “So, six fragments. Supposedly a seventh with Ildram, and potentially an eighth somewhere in the Lost Woods—if my dreams are to be believed.” She frowned. “I don’t suppose you have any leads on the final shard?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shook her head. “Nope—could be literally anywhere. But I promise, you will be the first to know if I find out. Happy?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda half-scowled, half-grinned. She wasn’t sure what to make of that. Shesan always had a way of getting under her skin. She settled for a simple nod. “Thanks again, Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The red-haired woman from another world inclined her head with a wry smile as she sauntered off.</span>

    <span><b><u>Zelda’s Journal - Diary of Dreams</u></b></span>
</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>21st of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I hesitate to include this dream. I’m only doing so because, well… I suppose I should just write it out while it’s still fresh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I was walking along the streets of Castletown when I came upon a mottled brown remlit. Something about the creature stood out to me, so I followed it. It didn’t run, but it kept its distance, skirting around corners and dipping out of sight as I followed behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It didn’t seem to be in a hurry, pausing every now and again to lick its paws and brush its whiskers. Still, I was always at least a couple dozen paces behind. Every time I lost sight of it, I felt a growing sense of trepidation, and when I caught sight of it again, it seemed to grow bigger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This continued until the creature was twice the size of a Goron. It then led me out into the market square and turned around. That was when I realized: it wasn’t a remlit, it was a lynel! The lynel let out a fierce roar, and I woke just as a crackling bolt of lightning struck the ground between us.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>22nd of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I was falling… flying? I’m not sure. I had wings and a feathered body, but I could not ascend except to catch the wind of rising air currents. Below me was what looked like a great eye—the Eye of Din? It looked just like an eye from high above, with a lone mountain out at sea forming the pupil, and a ring of islands together with the sea itself forming the iris.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In the dream I fell from the sky, gliding down as I passed through wooden rings held aloft by balloons. Around me were others who looked like me: wings outstretched, bodies covered in feathers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We descended from the sky at a frightening pace. The others peeled away from me and I struggled to keep up. Was it a race? The one at the front of the group held a staff that glinted with gold at the tip.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It didn’t last long. A few moments before I stirred awake. Was this dream hinting at the location of another shard? Is there an entire race of bird-people out there that we don’t know about?</span>
<br><br>
<span>I suppose we won’t know until we go searching.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Another long, stressful day. Zelda let out a contented sigh as she sank into the steaming hot water of her bath. She looked fondly over her shoulder to her handmaiden as Sera brushed her hair.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At least for a little while, all her troubles melted away. Here in this moment, she wasn’t <i>Queen</i> Zelda: she was just Zelda. No pretenses. No expectations. No responsibilities. No matter what other troubles life threw her way, at least she still had this. This was good. She needed this.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Oof.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu grunted as the wagon rolled over another bump. As thankful as he was for the cushy padding of his custom-made seat, he was still recovering from his injuries. If it were up to him—and if the fate of the kingdom were not at stake—he would have put the trip to Kakariko off by a few more days. But as Chancellor Taetus so eloquently put it: “destiny waits for no man.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Aptly, the lead horse of this particular carriage was named “Destiny.”)</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t so bad, he told himself. The journey thus far had been, if not comfortable, leisurely. So long as—“<i>urk!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oi!” Jedal yelled, rapping the knuckles of his maimed hand against the cabin wall. “If I have to mend the Champion up again, it’ll be your arse!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes sir!” a muffled voice came. “Apologies, Lord Sheikah!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Doesn’t that hurt?” Kellin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal held up his hand and wiggled the stubs of his digits, shaking his head with an exaggerated grimace. He had lost the better part of his fingers from index to pinky to Soulsteel in the fight to escape the Warlord’s throng. It had been the cleanest cut that Izu had ever seen, up until the blood obscured everything. The healed-over stumps left after the surgeons finished debriding enough flesh for a Healing to take effect, less so.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nah,” the man said. “To be honest? I don’t feel a thing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wagon slowed and then lurched to a stop, causing Izu to let out another muffled groan. He glanced around at the team—he had been out of it earlier and had lost track of time. Were they expecting to stop so soon? Gazra shook his head and Kellin shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“’Ey! What’s the holdup?” Jedal called out after a moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not sure, sir,” the response came. “We’re stopped.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll go check,” Kellin offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yup, right behind you,” Jedal said, hopping down to follow as she left the cabin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mmm. Izu supposed it wouldn’t be the worst thing to get out and stretch his legs. He stood and grabbed his walking stick. Wordlessly, Gazra leapt down and offered him a hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks, Gaz.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The burly man nodded, helping him down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu heard yelling up ahead and quickened his hobble as he rounded the wagon. Up ahead, Jedal and Kellin were arguing with a pair of soldiers while an entire company’s worth fanned out to search the caravan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A checkpoint? They weren’t expecting one. Izu strained to make out the conversation as he caught up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…As I said: our orders are from the Governor,” the more senior of the two soldiers said. A middling lieutenant. “All incoming traffic is to be searched, and that includes this caravan.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not questioning your orders,” Kellin said. “Look: we are here on official business from the Queen. As honor guard to Champion Izu—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Lady Sheikah, Lords Sheikah… <i>Champion Izu</i>,” the soldier said as Izu and Gazra approached, bowing his head respectfully. “Again: you all are free to go, but our orders are clear. We—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Would you listen to yourself, mate?!” Jedal interrupted. “Nevermind the balls—how ficking <i>stupid</i> would someone have to be to try—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Jedal, stand down,” Izu commanded, as calmly and firmly as he could manage. Jedal closed his mouth and stepped back, crossing his arms. “These men are just doing their jobs,” Izu added. “On behalf of the Crown, we thank you for your service.” He gave a respectful nod to both of the soldiers in turn. “We’ll comply with the search, but please be brisk. We are on urgent business after all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The lieutenant hesitated for a moment, before giving a salute. “Yes sir!” The sergeant at his side followed his lead, and the pair took off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Double-time it men, c’mon!” Izu heard the sergeant bark to those he passed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin gave him a wry grin. Izu winked. Jedal grunted, then turned and spat. “At least the countryside’s intact,” he said, before raising his voice loud enough for the guards around to hear: “Even if you apparently need a signed waiver from the Governor to take a shit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu snickered to himself, crossing his arms and covering his mouth to maintain composure. Kellin smacked her forehead with her palm, and even Gazra let out a jovial snort.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I doubt it’s as bad as that,” Izu said after a moment. “They’re just being thorough. They’ve good reason to be.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aye, I suppose,” Jedal condeeded. “I couldn’t see the Yiga trying anything with us, but you have a point.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>As the team arrived in Kakariko, it quickly became apparent the town was under martial law, with a heavy military presence. Izu scanned the streets: There was always a patrol in sight—usually two or three.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were met just outside the town square by Ryn, Koja, and Grenja.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Welcome to the fine city of Kakariko, Mr. Champion Izu the Magnificent, Sir!” Koja said with a rigid salute. Ryn stepped up beside her, also saluting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu groaned and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “It’s nice to see you too. Now drop the salutes. And if you ‘sir’ me one more time in private I’ll have you running laps around the town. That clear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Crystal clear, Your Magnificence,” Ryn said to a round of laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey you walked right into that one, Cap,” Jedal said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shook his head with a smile. It really was nice to see them, alive and in good spirits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heya Grenj.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gaz.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A few seconds passed. Izu glanced between the two.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pub later?” Gazra asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja took in a long breath and let it out with a groan. “Yeah, sure. Why not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra grunted back in acknowledgement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Izu scratched the stubble on his chin. Koja caught his eye and shook her head slowly. Izu gave a single nod back. That bad, huh? Koja curled one side of her lip and gestured as if to say “tell you later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem. So where’s Link gotten to?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lon Lon,” Ryn said, motioning over her shoulder. “’s where he spends his free time lately.” She rolled her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, it helps him to process his—<i>oww</i>,” Koja said as she caught an elbow in the side from Ryn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Izu said. “Well, unless you have other orders, feel free to take the evening off. All of you. Mother knows we all deserve it. I’ll catch up with Link later for a debriefing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The group said their goodbyes and waved as they headed off in pairs. Jedal gave Kellin a look and waggled his brow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I <i>suppose</i> I did agree to a drink back there.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Izu extended his walking stick, flipped the latch, and pressed it against the barn door. It yielded with a loud creak, and immediately his nostrils were assailed by the pungent smell of manure mixed with fresh hay.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just like home.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside were several stabled horses and oxgoats, and even a cow. At the far end, he spotted Link chatting with a tall, red-haired maiden as she tended to a chestnut mare, stroking its mane. Link said something Izu didn’t catch, and the woman giggled before turning to point to Izu as she noticed him approaching. </span>
<br><br>
<span>Link swung around and half-jumped in surprise. “Izu! Am I late?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The mare whinnied at the provocation and took off at a canter, giving Izu a wide berth as she darted out of the open barn door. Ahead, Link winced and turned about. “Sorry,” he said. “I know she’s skittish. I should be more careful around her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The red-haired woman merely clasped her hands and let out a sad, wistful sigh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shook his head, gathering his bearings. “Uhm. No, not at all. You weren’t with the others when we got in, so I thought I’d stop by and say ‘hi.’” He cocked his head to the side. “Say, who’s this lovely woman here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>His remark elicited a beaming smile from the girl.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, this is Malon,” Link said. “She’s an old friend of mine. I used to work here as a ranch hand, back before… after…” He paused, rubbing his neck. “Anyway, her dad owns the place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu took a step closer, and Malon rushed forward to greet him. He extended a hand and she took it in both of hers with a low bow. “It is an honor and a privilege, sir. On behalf of all of Kakariko: thank you, and welcome to Lon Lon Ranch! Please, let me know if there is anything we can do for you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh.” Izu smiled back at her, finding himself at a loss for words. He felt a catch in his throat and swallowed.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother Above, I’m getting too old for this,</i> he thought. Old and soft, just like pa.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine,” Izu said. “Thank you so much for your hospitality, Miss. I’m just here to talk with Link, though. I won’t be long.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just as well,” Malon said with a cheerful smile. “I’ll leave you boys to it, then.” She turned and waved to Link, then skipped past Izu and out of the barn, singing a simple but enchanting melody.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link walked up a moment later, looking awkward and uneasy. Izu noted his right arm—his shield arm, in Link’s case—was still wrapped in a sling. Link must have noticed Izu’s attention, as he began to rub it self-consciously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Best change the subject.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu gave him a once-over and whistled. “She sure is something. You’re a lucky guy, Link.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link paused, furrowing his brows. “Malon?” He blushed. “No—it’s not like that. We’re not together or anything. She’s just a friend.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just a friend, huh?” Izu said with a playful chuckle. “Really?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Yeah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother, he was serious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shook his head slowly, beaming from ear to ear. “That girl is head over heels for you. You know that, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scrunched up his face in disbelief, as if he had never once considered the idea. Knowing the kid, he probably hadn’t.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anyway, I’m not here to meddle in your love affairs,” Izu said. “Just thought I’d check in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link immediately tensed up, eyeing him with suspicion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu coughed and turned his head slightly as an excuse to break eye contact. He almost forgot how intense this man could be, and how readily he wore his emotions on his sleeve. “Not like that,” he said after a moment, trying to put Link more at ease. “Trust me, you don’t have anything to worry about. Just… a friendly visit. You know? Everyone’s been worried about you, and I promised Zelda I’d check in. I just wanted to…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh no. He said something wrong, didn’t he?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Worried about me?” Link asked after a moment. He glanced down to his arm again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu mentally kicked himself. “I know how that sounds. Listen…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Deep breath. Focus. Center. Izu drew on a tiny bit of magic, allowed his thoughts to diffuse, and let his attention go where it felt most natural. He was immediately rewarded with a splitting headache.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you…” Izu blinked, refocusing his vision and putting aside the pain. “Do you have your Luck up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?” Link said nonchalantly. “I always do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even in… <i>Goddesses</i>, wow. This guy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anyway,” Izu said. “The last thing I want to do is to make you worry or feel uncomfortable. When you’re ready, Zelda wants Fi to take a look at your—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I’m ready,” Link said. “Let’s go.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He brushed past Izu as he walked ahead. Izu turned and tilted his head to the side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You coming?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah… right behind you.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“More tea?” a serving girl asked, offering up a steaming pitcher.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, please,” Izu answered, offering up his cup. He quite liked the tea here. It had a nice bite to it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This place was nice. Much nicer than the barest essentials he was used to during travels from a lifetime of military service—which usually amounted to little more than a latrine and a two-man tent. He and Link sat in a cozy sitting room by a hearth overlooking a private glade around a large pond. Duchess Kaylein, Governor of Kakariko, had offered them full use of her family’s guest house during their stay in the town. Usually such niceties were reserved for dignitaries, but Izu supposed that’s what he and Link were, now. A veritable mansion—three stories, with more than a dozen rooms and at least three kitchens.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…So. You’re the Queen’s Champion now?” Link asked once the serving girl had left.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu raised an eyebrow. “Yes. And so are you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked surprised to hear that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What, you thought I could replace you? Please.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I just—uhm,” He gave Izu a weird look. “…I didn’t know there could be two Champions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shrugged. “There’s no law I know of saying there can’t be two. And besides, even if there were, the Queen could change it as easy as that.” He looked Link over, trying to get a read. Despite how easy it was to discern his emotions, figuring out what he was thinking was usually a much harder challenge. “We didn’t get the news you were still alive until the horde was on our doorstep,” he offered. “Zelda thought it best for morale to name me Champion, after bestowing upon me Hylia’s mark and announcing to everyone that I’d be fighting the Warlord.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded slowly. “Yeah. That makes sense. Sounds like her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought. Izu mulled it over for a moment, then decided to go for it. “You know, you’re the one who really saved the kingdom, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link cocked his head. “Um, what? No, <i>you</i> saved the kingdom. I’ve been stuck out here, trying to get back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shook his head. “No, Link. You and your team, not even counting everything else you’ve done, got ancient, forgotten knowledge back to Castletown. The Queen, inspired by that knowledge, devised a very clever trick. And I—using that very clever trick along with said ancient, forgotten knowledge, was able to accomplish the impossible. All of that was only possible because of you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link snorted in derision. “Come on, you’re just saying that to try and make me feel better. If anything, Zelda deserves the credit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, I am, and yes, Zelda deserves credit too,” Izu said, doubling down. “But that doesn’t mean it’s not true. It isn’t even an exaggeration. You saved the kingdom, Link.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gave him a skeptical look. “Even if not for that, you can’t say you wouldn’t have found a way without me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, listen to me,” Izu said, shifting forward in his seat. “You weren’t there. You don’t know how bleak it was. You remember how bad it was during the first siege?” He waited a moment for a nod. “That, but ten times worse.” He let out a huff. “Damnation, I <i>knew</i> I was going to die that day. I knew from the moment I got the summons. The whole team knew we were done for the moment the decision was made. Even if we had gone with Wymar’s plan, thousands would have died and we would have lost the city, at best. <i>At best</i>. Do you understand me? Do you understand what I’m saying?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… I don’t… know what to say. I just…” Link said, looking distant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Goddesses, he hated being so forceful, but the boy had to understand. Izu set down his tea and sat back in his seat. “Let me put it this way,” he said, shifting tact. “Why did you go to the Obsidian Spire?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link peered at him skeptically. “To figure out more about the Lightsworn order. It was one of the locations in my dreams. You know that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded. “And did anyone else think that was a good idea?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head. “Not at first, but Zelda eventually came around when I told her I was going with or without her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another nod. “Let me let you in on a secret,” Izu said with a hint of conspiratorial affectation. “Some men lead by command and authority—the Lord General, for instance. Most of the brass, actually.” He looked to Link for understanding. Link nodded. “Most men lead by experience, and some lead through respect,” he continued.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Like you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Like me,” Izu said. He paused for a long while, setting up for the next question. “And how do you lead?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scratched his head, giving the question serious thought. “To be honest, I don’t usually think of myself as a leader,” he said. “Except when I have to be. I kind of just… do what my heart tells me? What I know is right. And I trust that others will see that, and they’ll want to do the same.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Exactly!</i>” Izu said, pointing a finger at Link’s chest, towards the two shards of Courage he bore. “You, Link? You lead by example. You said it yourself—the only reason anyone went to the spire in the first place was because you believed in your mission, and you were willing to go alone if you had to. And the way you lead those men to save that regiment—same story. You are the kind of man who can inspire others to fight alongside you, to the death if that’s what it means. Not because you command them to, not because they trust you, not because they feel safe fighting alongside you, and not because it’s their duty. But because, Link, you are willing to take that stand with or without them. And let me tell you: that’s real power.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Courage, actually.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…What?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link held up the jagged fragments on his necklace and clinked them together.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu snorted with laughter. “Listen here, you little shit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finally, an honest-to-the-Mother smile. “Thanks, Izu,” Link said. “I needed to hear that. And I get what you’re saying. I think I’ve known for a while now, actually. I think… I just have to keep reminding myself that even though the road ahead may be hard, and even though I might lose sight of it from time to time…” He paused, nodding to himself with that unmistakable, Link-brand steely conviction in his eyes. “I just have to keep on going, no matter what. And when I’m feeling lost, when I find myself at my lowest point, I have to remind myself that Hylia chose me for a reason, and all I have to do is to have faith in her plan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother Above, this boy is as delusional as they come,</i> Izu thought to himself as he nodded along wordlessly. Far be it for him to interrupt a heroic monologue, though. He’d do his best to remember it. It would make for a great epitaph for whenever Link finally got himself killed and they erected a fifty-foot statue in his honor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Almost on cue, Fi materialized from the aether. “Master, an update: I have reestablished Link’s mark. Upon inspection, the problem was merely due to ᏬᏨᏛ’ᏫᎤᏨᏭ ᏯᏅᏈ’ᏬᏅᏭ’ᏅᏫᏈ ᏍᏫᏨᏯᏅᏫᏡᏅᏯ’Ꮕ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᏍᏅᎾᏬ’ᎺᎾᏫᏊ ᏪᎺᏡ’ᏈᎤᏨᏅᎺᏫ ᏍᎤᎧᏫᏯ’ᏫᏫᎾᏮ ᏯᏅᎺᏅᏯ ᏮᏨᏡ’ᏅᏅ ᏡᏫᎣᎤᏫᏪ’ᏍᏫᏑ’ᏨᎤᎤ ᎲᏨᏪ’~ᏇᎺ.” As she spoke, her hues shifted color from teal to purple and pink, then back again. “Fortunately by observing the changes in Link’s essence following his encounter with Ibboso, as compared to my established baseline, I was able to find and correct the error. The total cost was 242 units of Void Power. This information is being relayed to Zelda as we speak.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, really?” Link leapt forward to the edge of his seat. “I—” he cut himself off, looking down at his arm. “But uh… it’s still…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi turned in midair to face him. “Unfortunately, I am unable to offer additional insight into the nature of the physical or spiritual components of your wound at this time. As directed, I will maintain a presence nearby for observation, and will provide additional information and analysis should I learn more.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded slowly. “Yeah, I didn’t think it would be that easy. Thanks anyway, Fi. You’re the best.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi continued to float in midair, turning back to Izu.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu cleared his throat. “Yes, thank you, Fi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She continued to float.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re the best?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I exist to serve, Master,” Fi said as her form dissipated back into the aether.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sank back into his seat, looking glum.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Wait, was this before or after the rabbit?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>I’d really rather not talk about the rabbit,</i>” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, okay!” Izu said. “We don’t have to talk about the rabbit.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“I’m not really sure what they were,” Link said. “And if it weren’t for Grenja… even with Grenja… I don’t know what was real, and what was just in our minds.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu huffed. “Terrifying.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You don’t know the half of it,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But they’re gone now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If they aren’t, Seff thinks they will be in time. None of us are all that excited to go back and check, though.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Understandable.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“You know, I got hit with Bloodrage too,” Izu said, lifting his shirt to show his scars.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” Link said, leaning in to peer at them. “I hadn’t heard that, but yeah, it makes sense. How’d it go?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The singular most painful thing I have ever experienced,” Izu said. “And that’s saying something. Thank the Mother, I blacked out almost right away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yep</i>, that tracks,” Link said. “Same here. I don’t remember much, but boy did it hurt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still have another week and change before I’m fighting shape—at least by Jedal’s reckoning,” Izu said, pulling his shirt back down. A grunt. “<i>If</i> I’m ever in fighting shape again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If?” Link asked. “You got Healing, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, top notch,” Izu said. “But the nurse said I punctured a lung, and even if they had gotten to me right away it would’ve been difficult to fully reverse the damage. Heh. Might not ever be as spry as I once was. Doubt I’ll ever win another tournament.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. “Well in that case, we’ll have to get you over to the spire. You can go through the same trials I did—for all we know it could awaken Lightsworn powers, too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Izu mulled it over. The dangers of being a hero… On the one hand, if that actually could heal him, it was a very attractive course of action. On the other…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’ll have to see. We have a lot to do, and we might not be able to spare the time.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“<i>Amazing,</i>” Izu said, turning the Transfabrulator over. A piece of ancient technology, in the palm of his hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just wait until you see it in action.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>VORP!</i> <b>CRASH!</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dear sweet Mother in the heavens above,” Izu whispered. “How could anyone possibly block that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They don’t,” Koja said with a grin.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Wait, pirates?” Izu asked, dumbfounded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, we tracked them down from a group of bandits we found out in the hills,” Ryn said. “They had no idea we were on to them until it was too late. <i>Vorp!</i>” She cackled and gave a wicked smile as she mimed using the Transfabrulator.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So they were behind the missing grain shipments as well?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nah, that was another random bandit group,” Koja said. “The pirates were the ones who stole all the bombs in town. Right under the Governor’s nose! Her most prized paintings, too. She was livid.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They coordinated their raids to distract the local guard and maximize their success rates,” Link said. “As best we can tell, they don’t have a common leader or anything. Just that same shady figure that’s been paying them to do what they were already going to do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Makes sense,” Izu said, scratching his chin. “So do we know for certain that that was who poisoned the well?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nope, still haven’t figured that one out,” Ryn said. “But it’s a safe bet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded. “Have there been any more happenings? Since you put them away, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, but it’s only been four days since the last raid,” Link answered. “I don’t think we can rest easy just yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The town’s still under martial law,” Ryn added, “but it’s eased up quite a bit since we got here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, you should’ve seen it,” Koja said. “We couldn’t take a shit until we got signed waivers from the Governor!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wordlessly, everyone turned to stare at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? Oh come on, that joke was hilarious when Jedal told it to me earlier!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal leaned over and clapped her on the shoulder. “Lass, I find it’s more about the timing and delivery than anything. Might want to work on yours.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Koja, just face it girl,” Ryn said. “Your head is where jokes go to die.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gah!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Kellin, I owe you one,” Jedal said as he rushed back to their table. “Big time. Remind me to pay you back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm,” she said, crossing her legs and rolling her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Promise!” Jedal said, knocking on the table. “Anything you ask.” He grinned and took off towards a pair of eager-looking ladies waiting for him at the exit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn gave her a questioning look. “What’d you do?”</span>

You lied to me, and I can’t ever forgive you for that.”</span>

<br><br>

<span>“I just… I just wanted to help them, man! Those kids…” Grenja said, sobbing into a pint of beer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra patted him on the back. “It’s okay. Let it out, man. We’ve all been there.”</span>
