<span>“Are you a traitor?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, never,” the young man said, brusque. He looked nervous. Jittery.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda recorded his response, as well as other details of his disposition. She couldn’t be sure of his age, but his boyish features suggested he might well be the youngest Sheikah she’d met thus far.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you working with Vesyrn?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda did a double take.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh. Not to traitorous ends,” he added swiftly. “He was my handler. My mentor. That’s all. I swear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>His response is sincere,</i> Fi’s voice echoed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda finished her notes. Why couldn’t they all be this straightforward?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That will be all for now,” she said, nodding to the guards.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really?” he asked, seeming surprised. “That’s it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda refrained from further comment, watching silently as he was led away. This was going much slower than anticipated; best not to draw it out any longer than it had to be.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Are you a traitor?” Zelda asked. <i>Traitor</i>, she thought to herself over and over. At some point, it had stopped sounding like a real word.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am not, Your Grace,” the man said with a frown. He sat with one leg over the other, hands on his knee. He seemed attentive and respectful, with an air of refined charm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She recorded his response and the other details. “Are you working with Vesyrn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Your Grace. It pains me even to be associated with that wretch of a man. His treachery is a stain upon us all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A little much, she thought, but he was forthcoming at least—unlike most of the others. Zelda jotted down her notes.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I cannot be sure of his response,</i> Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really?” Zelda blurted out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, nothing,” she said, nodding to the guards. “Thank you for your cooperation. That will be all for now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rose, bowed to her, then nodded to the guards and cleared the room without further delay.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Are you a traitor?” Zelda asked by rote.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The older Sheikah woman stared at her incredulously. “No, Your Grace,” she said. “No, I am not. Why do you ask?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rolled her eyes. Best to stick to the script. “Are you working with Vesyrn?” she continued, scribbling notes. The hours were dragging by, and her mind was well beyond protesting the tedium.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman raised an eyebrow. “What’s your angle here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda put down her quill, calmly placing her hands on the table with fingers laced. She took a long, steady breath. <i>Patience</i>, she had to remind herself. She met the woman’s eyes with a smile. “I understand your frustration. But if you would be so kind as to answer my questions truthfully and directly, we will be done much sooner.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This can’t be just some official bookkeeping,” the woman said, wholly ignoring Zelda’s instruction. “Otherwise you wouldn’t be doing it yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda closed her eyes, resting her head on the table. How many more were left? Surely they were almost done by now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Sheikah woman went on, indifferent to her plight. “And I wouldn’t expect you of all people to think you might make a novel contribution here. You’ve clearly got something in mind. So, what is this about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you working with Vesyrn?” Zelda repeated, not bothering to raise her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” the woman said, putting that distinct smarmy affectation to her voice. Zelda heard the shuffle of the guardsmen shifting stance and raising their weapons, indicating the woman had made an attempt to stand. She was the… what, sixth to try that now? Why did they have to be so insistent with the attempts to ingratiate themselves?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda leaned back in her chair, rubbing her face. “Please,” she said. “Just answer the question.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Forgive me,” the woman said. “I just want to help. That’s all. There’s so much to be done, and we’re less than useless like this. You have to see that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You can best help by answering my question,” Zelda said tersely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“With respect, Your Grace, but what does that accomplish? You’re clearly asking these questions of all of us. Do you imagine any traitors would out themselves? You know what we are, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nayru’s tits!” Zelda yelled, her frustration having reached its limits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman withdrew fractionally; even she was shocked at Zelda’s sudden outburst.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Listen</i>,” Zelda said irritably. “I don’t give a helmarat’s ass about anything you have to say right now. I’m likely the most incompetent interrogator you’ll ever have the good fortune to be interrogated by, so it doesn’t even matter what I think about you. But I have magical powers granted to me by <i>Hylia herself</i> that lets me tell when someone is being sincere and honest. And they <i>don’t work</i> when you’re trying to be clever or smarmy. So just answer the <i>thrice-damned question</i>, and we’ll be done here. Okay?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” the Sheikah woman said. “In that case: no. I’m not working with Vesyrn. In fact, I’ve never even met him face to face.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you!”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I judge her response to be sincere,</i> Fi’s voice said. Zelda made the note.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My pleasure, Your Grace. Is that all?” the woman asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For now,” she said, motioning to the guards.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Goddesses, have mercy.</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda handed her final report to Wymar. He looked the parchment over studiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And you’re certain of this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded. “Of the cleared ones, at least. The ‘maybe clear’ category I’m just guessing from the fact that everyone judged them to be loyal. I thought perhaps they could work in conjunction with the cleared ones, to minimize risk? I’ll keep a couple of the most trusted cleared ones for security, and send the rest after the roaming Blin. Arlinkar should be fit for duty by now; I trust him to handle the details.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar frowned. “There are two in the ‘clear’ category that we’ve all judged to be disloyal. Zelda, I can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know!” she said, throwing up her hands. “I know, Wymar. Trust me, I know how it sounds. But you have to have faith in me, and trust that I know what I’m doing. I’m certain—they’re <i>all</i> loyal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He eyed her. She stood, resolute.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” he said, relenting. “As you say. What are your plans for the others?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shifted uneasily. She couldn’t imagine that the next part was going to be well received. “I want to go in for at least one more round of questioning, using the cleared Sheikah for assistance. And while I work out how to best sort through them, maybe we can…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar stiffened up, refusing to meet her eye. She fell silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I’m leaving for the front in the morning. We both know that I can’t spare the men necessary to guard them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s fine,” she said, placing a hand on his arm. “Listen: I understand. But they can’t all be traitors! If you don’t think it’s worth it to sort through them further, then we’ll go with your initial plan. If you believe you can keep the rest under control, then I defer to your judgement.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded, easing up. “Thank you. I’ll take the remainder with me, then. I’ll rest better anyway knowing that you’re not in danger.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You shouldn’t worry about me.” Zelda tried to assure him with a smile. “Wymar, the Sheikah are back in service! Well, some of them at least. I’m feeling safer already.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He returned her smile, if somewhat uneasily.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link undid the lace on his chest and placed his hand on the table, keeping his eyes on her the whole time. </span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda didn’t know for sure what approach he planned on taking, and so she did her best to not to give anything away prematurely. She was vulnerable right now, but he couldn’t possibly know that. One thing was for certain; he was going to have to put in a lot more effort than that if he wanted to get at her secrets.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So unless I’m misinterpreting…” he said, pausing in thought. “As long as I stay clear of the gossips, I can move to your side of the castle?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She met his eyes, unflinching. “That might be a possibility. But you don’t know who all the gossips are.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gaped at her, screwing up his face. “Uh, I’m pretty sure I do. And I don’t understand why this has to be so complicated. You know I intend to seduce you. Can you just give me a straight answer? Do you have any other lovers, or not?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link!” Zelda said, taken aback. “You can’t just ask questions like that! And besides, I don’t even know if it will work out until you try it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” he said, reaching for her chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Zelda yelped, batting his hand away. “You can’t just—that’s not how this works!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link pulled back, crossing his arms in frustration. “Look. I’m trying my best here. It’s not my fault if I don’t know what I’m doing. It’s your job to explain the rules.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, fine,” she said. She had to admit he had a point. It was just—she was used to more experienced partners. “I’ll walk you through this. But don’t get upset if it doesn’t go exactly the way you want. One step at a time, okay? Are you ready?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. Pick up your hand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did so.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now—without saying anything—place the three cards you intend to use face down on your side of the table.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded again, following along.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Declare your intent,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I intend to seduce you and steal your secrets so I can avoid your gossips—even though I already know which ones they are—and infiltrate further to your side of the castle. But you knew all that already.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda ignored him, placing four of her own cards face down—two green Sheikah, a blue lover, and a red mystic. “Now roll the dice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did so. A three. Zelda muttered a curse under her breath, picking up the lover card and returning it to her hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now flip them over,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched with increasing agitation as he flipped over a red lover, a green merchant, and a blue Sheikah. Ugh. She was expecting him to play the red general. She still had a chance to keep him from progressing, but first she’d have to make sure he didn’t—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link played a second blue Sheikah over his face-up one. “I <i>can</i> do that, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Another blue Sheikah?!</i> How… “—Yes. That is technically a legal move.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. Good. Then I use my blue Sheikah to distract your green ones.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link! Are you cheating? How do you know I have two green Sheikah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because you just told me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What—no, you can’t… that’s not…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda! Relax, I’m only joking,” he said with a laugh. “But really. What else would you play? You expected me to use the red general again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scowled, removing her two Sheikah from play. Link did the same. He pushed his merchant forward, and she was forced to show her mystic. She took his red rupee and both cards were returned to their hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Satisfied? I now send my red lover to seduce you and steal your—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yes, fine,” she said bitterly, unwinding the lace on her chest and flipping it open. “Go ahead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a smirk, Link reached inside and took out the runed figurine that represented her secret documents, placing it in his own chest.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda looked out over the city as she was carried by litter to the Temple of Hylia. It was the first time she had been out of the castle in almost two weeks, and Castletown was in a worse state than she had thought.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The stench was every bit as unbearable as before, even if the grizzly scenes of battle and bloodshed had long-since been cleaned up and the bodies carted away. Many houses were boarded up. It looked like the raw materials used for barricading the streets during the siege had been repurposed to build makeshift shelters and tents. But there were still <i>so many</i> people out on the streets, and piles of garbage and refuse littered the walkways and alleys. Zelda held her lavender-scented silk closer to her face, resolving to do something—anything about this mess. It both infuriated and saddened her to see her people living in such squalor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her procession reached the temple and she stepped down from the litter, walking the short way to meet the High Priestess at the stone steps. The middle-aged woman was garbed in a flowing white dress with her white-blonde hair pulled into a tight bun. Above them, the magnificent bell tower of the temple loomed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Our queen, the blessed champion of the Holy Mother, graces us with her presence,” Vestele intoned reverently to a chorus of bells held by a dozen monks standing on either side of her. The incense from their lamps wafted and curled through the air with a passing breeze. Vestele descended the steps and offered her hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took it with a curtsy. “It is my pleasure, Your Holiness. Thank you for receiving me. We have much to discuss.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But of course. Please—after you, Your Grace,” Vestele said, gesturing to the abbey.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, taking the lead. Her guard fanned out to cover the steps. Link and her two Sheikah bodyguards took up watch by the archway leading to the abbey as Zelda passed inside. She would prefer them at her side to be sure, but weapons were not permitted anywhere inside the temple grounds, and neither were soldiers of any variety.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She and the priestess continued alone through a hanging garden featuring rows of stone statues, depicting the forms of previous monarchs. Zelda looked for it, but Father’s figure was nowhere to be found.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It has been commissioned, though it is not yet complete,” Vestele said, following her gaze. “I will be sure to send for you once it arrives.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you. I look forward to seeing it,” Zelda lied with an amiable smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An abbot met them as they reached the vestibule and lead them inside. Zelda’s heart fluttered in her chest as she went over the words again in her mind. She was not by any means looking forward to this meeting, and it approached nearer with every step.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finally they reached a sitting room that had been prepared for the occasion. Zelda entered and took a seat; Vestele after her. The abbot closed the door behind them, and at last they were alone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The priestess relaxed into her seat. “You’re a bundle of nerves, dear,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” Zelda said. She tried not to blush. “Can you blame me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tea?” Vestele reached for the kettle on the table and poured two cups, offering Zelda one.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “Thank you.” Zelda took the offered cup.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid we’re fresh out of nightshade, or I’d offer some,” Vestele said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda choked, fighting to keep herself from spewing hot liquid over her host. “Pardon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just a bit of humor to lighten the mood," she offered. Vestele laughed, and Zelda joined her uneasily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda set her cup aside. She had lost her train of thought now, and was unsure how to begin. “I’ve been meaning to speak with you for some time now,” she began awkwardly. “Concerning the events of that day. I find myself in the most precarious situation. On one hand, the entire army saw me combat the hordes with Hylia’s might. On the other…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shifted in her seat, edging closer. “What’s she calling herself?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cocked her head quizzically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know it wasn’t Hylia who granted you that boon, dear,” Vestele said. “So who is it? What is she calling herself?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid you’re mistaken,” Zelda replied, feeling genuinely confused. “The Holy Mother spoke to me—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nonsense,” Vestele said, waving a hand dismissively. “Hylia’s been dead for ages.” Zelda sputtered—how did she… <i>ages?</i>—yet Vestele continued on casually, paying her no mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “I can’t tell you how much I’ve been dreading this conversation,” she said. “I’ve been fretting over how best to get in touch with you—and whether any of our efforts would be for naught. I’m glad you’ve come to me, though. It means she’s willing to bargain. They can be quite conniving—though I suppose this one seems <i>benevolent</i> enough.” She paused, rubbing her forehead. “It’s hard to believe something like this is happening in my lifetime.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you… do you mean Fi?” Zelda asked, completely uncertain as to what this conversation was about.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele regarded her coolly, setting aside her teacup. “Your Grace, I cannot impress upon you how important it is for you to answer me truthfully right now. Despite whatever you may believe—whatever it is you <i>may have been told</i>—the fate of this kingdom is still very much at stake. Now, how <i>exactly</i> is it you know that name?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite herself, Zelda withered under the priestess’ gaze. “Uh, Fi? A little help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Mistress,” Fi said, materializing from the aether at her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By the Mother!” Vestele gaped, fumbling for her spectacles as she nearly jumped out of her seat. She inspected the ethereal entity, circling around. With care, she reached out and ran her fingers through Fi’s form, leaving wisps of chromatic vapor in her wake. Fi repaired herself just as quickly. “How can this be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda only gawked. How did Vestele know about Fi? And what in <i>damnation</i> was she so concerned about?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can confirm that it was indeed Hylia who contacted Zelda,” Fi said, seeming unfazed by Vestele’s prodding. She floated in place, turning to face the priestess as she spoke. “However, it is also true that Hylia is no more. Priestess: I can only surmise that your belief stems from an event that happened many ages ago. Though it is likely the case that Hylia was defeated and forced to withdraw from the world, she did not die. Indeed, her death was a more recent event; she gave the last of her power to save your people from the Blin assault. I am certain of this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Astounding,</i>” Vestele said in awe. “Esteemed Emissary, what more can you tell us of the Holy Mother?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Regrettably, little more information is available to me at this time,” Fi said. “As I have already informed Zelda: subsequent to Hylia’s passing, I no longer have access to many of my previous memories. I expect your knowledge of this subject, and others, likely far exceeds my own at present.”</span>
<br><br> 
<span>The priestess sighed. “I am getting on in age,” she said, returning to her seat and stowing away her spectacles. “I suppose I should know better than to get my hopes up by now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er, Vestele?” Zelda asked. “Not to downplay any of this—I’m certain it’s all very important—but how is it <i>you</i> know about Fi? And about Hylia dying, for that matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele looked to her and made to speak, but then shook her head and turned her attention back to Fi. “We’ll get to that. First: Esteemed Emissary, I have to be sure. You are certain the entity that contacted Zelda was <i>Hylia</i>? She was not contacted at any time by a Fae?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>A Fae?!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, I am certain,” Fi said decisively. “My records do not indicate any contact by Fae.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, come on! Zelda did a double take, looking between her and the floating specter. What did <i>Fae</i> have to do with anything?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fae—they’re something like castoffs,” Vestele said, acknowledging Zelda’s confusion. “Shells. Husks. Fragments of the Goddess Hylia that broke off from what remained of her spirit, traveled through the Void, and made their way here to our world. Often they have her memories. Rarely do they care for us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, that sounded ominous. Zelda puzzled through it, but… “But that makes no sense,” she said. “What possible connection could that have to… well, <i>Fae</i>? You know, like folktales? These are the same Fae you’re talking about, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm, where to begin,” Vestele muttered as if to herself. She looked deep in thought, and Zelda thought it best not to interrupt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, the expectation that I will contribute in any meaningful capacity to the current conversation grows vanishingly small,” Fi said. “Unless you require further assistance, I will now cease projecting this avatar to conserve power.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh—okay,” Zelda said uncertainly. Fi had such a strange way of speaking at times. “Thank you, Fi. You’ll still be around if I need you, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As always, Mistress,” Fi said, vanishing just as abruptly as she appeared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele looked woefully at the vacated space. “Tell me, what do you know already?” she asked, attention falling back to Zelda.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised an eyebrow. What <i>did</i> she know? “Well, I always assumed they were just stories and fables,” she said frankly. “But I do find it curious how abruptly those stories fell out of favor. According to my research, that is. Did something happen around the time of Arminel’s Conquest?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele frowned. “You’re not the first to make the connection. It’s one of our greatest failings. We should have been more careful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Faith, dear,” Vestele said. She gave a curt laugh. “Or rather the Seekers, if you want to be precise. And bear in mind—I had no part in those decisions. No more than your part in founding Hyrule.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Seekers. Zelda chewed on the words. An order of monks, administered by the Faith, who developed their magical acuity to its limits. Their job was to, well, seek out those with innate magical talent at a young age, so that they could be properly trained and placed within society.</span>
<br><br/>
<span>“I thought the Seekers were—” she began.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, they are,” Vestele interrupted. “That just wasn’t their original purpose.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Vestele?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hm?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Intellectually, Zelda knew the High Priestess was not the one deserving of her anger. She tried to hold on to that, tried not to let too much bite into her words. “Please don’t take this the wrong way, but how <i>dare</i> the Faith perpetuate such a lie to our people all this time? If you believed Hylia to be dead—then <i>why</i>?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele winced. “It’s a fair question,” she said. “And one I had to wrestle with myself. I sympathize with your anger. But one finds themselves in a position such as ours, and we’re forced to choose. On one hand there is tradition, and stability. On the other—who knows what chaos the realm would be plunged into, if they knew? I always held that the core teachings remained true, regardless of Hylia’s absence. And if that’s so, then what are a few harmless lies if they give people hope? Am I wrong to want to give them hope, in the face of such a bleak and unforgiving world as ours?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That didn’t sit right with her at all, but she also couldn’t fault the reasoning. “I suppose it isn’t important right now,” Zelda said, wanting to change the subject. “What more can you tell me of the Fae? You seemed genuinely worried earlier, and that gives me pause. I take it they’re… somehow dangerous?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know how I said they were like fragments of Hylia, cast off from her essence?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shifted, curling her feet under her legs. Zelda found herself mimicking the motion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Keep in mind that we don’t know all that much. But the Fae… something about being disconnected from Hylia’s spirit deprives them of the nourishment they need to survive. And so they feed on our essence instead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt a chill crawl up her spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not all of them appear to be malicious. We were saved by one once. One calling herself Lucia. You would know the event as ‘The Reaffirmation.’ At the height of the Gerudo Wars, she came to us claiming to be Hylia herself. And with her aid, we cast out the Gerudo. And their dark god.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Their <i>what?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele leaned in closer, voice barely above a whisper. “Their dark god. <i>Morudo Geira.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head. Somehow the name sounded familiar, though she had never heard it before and was fairly certain she had never come across it in her studies.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele waved a hand. “A tale for another time. Where was I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lucia?” Zelda ventured. “Feeding off our souls?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The priestess nodded. “You asked about folklore? Well, if you view the stories from the right perspective, then you’ll see it clearly enough. In the stories, Fae blessed villages in exchange for humble offerings. Yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded hesitantly. “That doesn’t sound so bad,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it doesn’t,” Vestele replied. “Not until you look closer. Not until you read the right accounts. Perhaps you’ve heard the tale of a man who dreamed of restoring Hyrule to its former glory? They say he led the largest army ever assembled and marched it over the Plains of Ruin to retake our ancestral lands from the hordes once and for all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gasped. “No. Arminel?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The one and the same.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Arminel’s Conquest referred to the period of protracted war against the Blin from around year 540 to 600 of the Forsaken Era. Despite sixty years of war, every gain by the general and his armies was offset by equal or greater losses. The costs were immense, and countless lives were lost.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m going to guess he didn’t die peacefully in his sleep, as the histories say?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Vestele said, shaking her head with a sad smile. “No, the truth is far more sinister. It wasn’t dreams of glory that blinded the general to his folly. It was a Fae named <i>Cyrae</i>. She promised him victory in exchange for the souls of those he slew… and of those who died in battle. Over the years the general became increasingly obsessed with what he viewed as his <i>destiny</i>, sending his forces on ever riskier assaults in an effort to maintain her favor. But as you might guess, she never intended to allow the general his victory; she only desired sustenance. She was careful not to let the scales tip too far, knowing Arminel would never return home in defeat when victory seemed close at hand. Eventually the general was assassinated by his younger brother—the first Seeker—who learned of Cyrae and her treachery. He sealed the Fae in the spear he shoved through his brother’s back, and there she remains to this day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They sat in eerie silence as Zelda thought on the tale. She had to admit it made more sense than the historical account, at least in light of everything else she now knew. She always wondered how a brilliant general could have been such an imbecile as to fight a losing war for sixty years.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But that doesn’t answer my question,” she said after a time. “What does that have anything to do with folklore?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shrugged. "I admit, Cyrae was one of the worst by far. Most Fae weren’t so bad, to hear it told. That is, until you consider desperate farmers being convinced to flay their children alive and drown them in their own blood out of fear of a bad harvest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shuddered. “Okay. I see your point.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Seekers were founded to find the Fae,” Vestele said. “All of them. To seal them, bind them, or destroy them where possible. Where not, they were locked away into mundane items and tossed into the ocean, or buried beneath the earth in deep chasms. And all records were destroyed, in hopes of preventing them from ever being found.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But I don’t understand,” Zelda said, confused. “If you believed I was under the influence of a Fae, then why—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Need I remind you that you wear the Crown, <i>Your Grace</i>?” Vestele interrupted. “What could we have possibly done? We certainly considered our options, but any brash action on our part would have thrown the kingdom into chaos just as surely. No. After your assault on the Blin all that was left was to hope for the best, and prepare for the worst.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda considered her words carefully, contemplating how best to proceed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is obvious to me you care deeply about our people,” she said after a moment, studying Vestele as the priestess gave a slight smirk. “And I get the impression that you wish you could do more. No?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What exactly is it you’re suggesting?“ Vestele said, her smirk falling away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vestele, I have so many questions. You know so much that I do not, and yet I also get the impression you feel that you are just as in the dark as I am.” Zelda paused, registering the priestess’ solemn nod. “I want to remedy that. In time. But there is so much work to be done, and although the challenges before us seem insurmountable, I <i>do</i> have hope. I want…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda trailed off, searching for the right words. She felt that <i>conviction</i> stirring deep within her. The feeling she had when she saw firsthand the devastation the Blin had wrought. The feeling of seeing Link fall to his attackers, and of pouring everything she had into righting that injustice. She recognized it now as the same feeling that had driven her her entire life, fueling her desire to recover and build upon lost knowledge, of wanting to make her kingdom a better place for all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>More than ever, she saw the <i>wrong</i> in the world, and felt a <i>determination</i> to do something about it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I never again want our people to face this horror,“ she said slowly. Resolute. “I will end the blights, or I will die trying.” She turned back to Vestele. “Will you help me?”</span>
<br><br>   
<span>Vestele studied her, mouth agape. “I never expected…” she started. “Of course, Your Grace. Tell me, what must I do?”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda stepped up onto the makeshift podium. Link and Cove—one of her Sheikah guards—stood behind her; Vestele to her right. Her royal guard stood at arms between them and the gathered crowd.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Citizens of Castletown! People of Hyrule!” she cried. “Hear me! The Crown and the Faith stand united in these times of heartache, strife, and adversity. We know your plight! You are scared. You are hungry. You fear for your families, and for your children. But as the teachings say: darkness comes before the light! Together—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It all happened so fast. Someone crashed into her from behind, knocking the wind from her lungs. She hit the wooden platform <i>hard</i>, jarring her head. Screams erupted from the crowd, and soldiers were barking orders. An ice barrier erupted inches from her face. Zelda tried to climb to her feet, but she was yanked back by her legs off of the platform and onto the brick walkway behind it. No sooner, an explosion sounded from the far side of the podium.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda clutched her ears and gasped for air, trying to catch her breath. Just as she regained her bearings, Link dove in beside her, Vestele at his side. The priestess curled up, using the wooden platform for cover.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s happening?!” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stay down!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace! Come with me! We have to get you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A bomb! He has another bomb!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Before she could react, a pair of arms had her by the shoulders and she was dragged into a nearby building. She dove forward and tensed up, expecting another explosion. None came.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda! Are you alright?" Link, calling to her from the doorway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m… I’m okay. I think. I hit my head. Just some cuts and bruises. What’s happening?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>"Stay here,” Link said, just three guardsman poured into the building. He pointed to Cove. “You! Keep her safe!” he commanded, running off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sat up against the wall. One of the guardsman offered her a flask, and she used it to wash away the dirt and blood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had been such a fool. Such a fool, to think this would end well.</span>
