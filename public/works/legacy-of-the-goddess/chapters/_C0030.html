<span><i><u>24th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Can it be? Am I finally getting back to research? It feels like it’s been ages.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We’re headed for a military outpost / supply depot near Lake Hylia. Some weeks ago I arranged for a handful of Blin to be captured and held there, intending to observe them and learn more of their culture and language. …And perhaps use them as test subjects for Fi to perform more dangerous experiments regarding Old Magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I had also hoped to study Soulsteel directly, but capturing and holding any Blin capable of summoning forth those vile weapons has proved far too dangerous for anyone involved. I have been informed that in the various attempts, there have been fourteen deaths and six maimings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>My heart weeps for the brave souls who gave their lives in hopes of learning more about our enemy. As I have no new ideas for how to improve upon previous attempts by Wymar and his men, I cannot in good conscience order anyone else to try. Taking the creatures captive is easy enough, as they cannot summon their weapons while unconscious. However, no matter their restraint—short of hacking off their limbs—those that possess the power to summon Soulsteel can do so at will. They draw the weapons forth from their own bodies, and can seemingly do so from any point. This makes holding them against their will for any length of time an exercise in futility. And once they break loose…</span>
<br><br>
<span>What we do know:</span>
<br><br>
<span>By and large, the shape and form of Soulsteel weapons would not be effective in the traditional sense. That is, if they were made from normal materials, their various notches, protrusions, odd angles, spikes, etc., would significantly hamper their function and severely reduce their offensive potential. Of course, this does not matter in the slightest when any part of the blade can effortlessly cleave through imbued steel. It’s almost like they were designed first and foremost to look as menacing as possible—and on that count, they readily succeed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>According to some reports, the weapons seem to drink in the light around them, like casting reverse shadows. I haven’t seen any myself, so I can only speculate. They disappear into puffs of smoke moments after they are dropped, or if their wielder is killed or incapacitated. And if any Hylian attempts to hold one before it dissipates, they immediately seize up with painful convulsions. The experience isn’t fatal as far as we know, just agonizing and harrowing. Those unlucky few who have gone through the spell describe it as feeling like their soul is burning up from the inside, very similar to accounts of Bloodrage. I do wonder if there are any long-term effects from this (or anything Fi could detect?), but all indications point towards ‘no,’ at least for a single, short exposure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As for the captive Blin, they were taken well before the Soulsteel ritual, and have remained isolated in the intervening time. No Soulsteel, no Bloodrage—just some relatively harmless Bokoblins. I plan to set Fi to observe them as soon as we arrive.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>25th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Well, that didn’t take long. Even when prodded, the Bokoblins rarely verbally communicate aside from grunts, single words, and the occasional two or three word phrase. Fi has managed to compile a vocabulary of a few dozen words, but from her observations, she doesn’t believe their language has any complex structure to it, and cautions that it may be difficult or impossible to communicate anything but the simplest of ideas to them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This doesn’t add up though—if that were true, then how are they so organized? Not to mention the dream where I met Ildram, who most certainly had complex thoughts, even if his speech was somewhat crude and simplistic. On that note—I’m not certain if he actually knows Hylian, or if it was the power behind my dreams or his ritual (or both) that translated for him, but in either case, he is a clear example of a Blin who understands more than simple grunting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Also! It’s well known that the larger Blin tend to be more intelligent. In fact, I asked about capturing some of those to add to this group, and was informed that it initially contained two Bulblin, but they had to be put down because they kept causing problems and coordinating the others to try and attack the guards and escape. This would be promising to follow up on, but frustratingly the prospects of capturing additional Blin are low, at least for the time being. As far as we know, all the ones west of Talus wield Soulsteel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grr.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I’ve come to the conclusion that this is most likely another example of Fi being wholly incapable of reasoning about anything other than what’s directly in front of her. My memory of what Ildram said to me in the dream isn’t great, but I suppose I can spend some time racking my brain to try and transcribe it for her to work with. Maybe that will help? There was lots of repetition, and he only used short phrases…</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Addendum:</u></span>
<br><br>
<span>After sharing with Fi, she posits an interesting hypothesis: that Blin communicate with one another by building up a “semantic web” using word pairs. That is, they have a root word that represents an object, and they state it repeatedly alongside qualities that object possesses. Once they’ve described two objects and their relevant details, they then describe how one object relates to another.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If true, that would actually make a lot of sense! Even if the less intelligent of their kind can barely hold two thoughts in their head at the same time, the more intelligent ones can still communicate complex ideas to them if they try long and hard enough. How fascinating! I had never considered that language could be so varied.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even if we are unlikely to make more progress right away, I can’t imagine Fi will have any difficulty learning and translating their language should we need her to. She concurs with this assessment, reminding me that communication is one of her primary functions.</span>
<br><br>
<hr/>
<br>
<span>Having the better part of a day to kill (Fi is busy observing Link), there’s an idea I’ve been meaning to try for a while, using Foretelling in conjunction with Scrying. Essentially, one splits up an area to search using a grid on a map. One then uses Foretelling to try and discern whether or not Scrying into any given area would be successful before actually taking the time to Scry, thereby saving considerable time and effort.</span>
<br><br>
<span>My initial tests were a resounding success! I had a soldier take a painted red rock, roll a die, and then go in one of the cardinal directions about a five hundred meters out, placing the rock in a visible location. In four trials, I was able to locate the rock on the first try. And just to make sure there weren’t any confounding factors with the shards of Wisdom or my connection to Fi or anything like that, I had Laylith do the same. She succeeded twice in a row.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unfortunately, that’s where we ran into problems.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We tried altering the parameters of the experiment by having the soldier choose for himself which direction to go and place the stone. In this trial… it’s difficult to explain, but Foretelling just didn’t give the same feeling, and neither of us were able to do better than chance. We also tried having the four soldiers roll a dice to see who gets the stone before each of them walked off to their designated locations. Same result: nothing. And predictably, doing the same but having them choose amongst themselves also failed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I am forced to conclude that anything involving people and decision making is just too complex for Foretelling to give useful results.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh well. It was worth a shot. I’m out of ideas, so I think I’ll just relax for the rest-</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda jumped and spun at the sound of someone entering her tent unannounced, fumbling and nearly knocking over her inkwell in the process. Before her stood a Zoran male wearing scale armor, and behind him, Shesan. She blinked in confusion before her mind caught up with her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Golvara?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wordlessly, the Zora extended his hand. Hanging from it was a thin woven cord and a jagged shard of gold: The fourth fragment of Wisdom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Cautiously, Zelda stood and accepted the offering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Golvara questioned the wisdom of delivering it to Izu in Kakariko, when coming here would be just as fast,” Shesan offered by way of explanation. “I could not fault his logic, and so here we are.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stared for a long moment at the golden fragment, feeling an odd sense of enchantment. Holding it felt <i>right</i>. Eventually, she came to her senses and slipped it over her neck. “Where are my manners?” she said, offering the traditional Zora greeting: elbows extended outward and hands cupped to form a sphere. “Welcome, Golvara, and thank you. I know you’ve been through so much to recover this. I am in your debt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Golvara returned the gesture. “This one wrongly judged you upon our first meeting,” he said. “Please accept Golvara’s apology as recompense.” He bowed his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I—uhm… yes, of course,” Zelda said, fumbling over her words. <i>What?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She clearly understood even less than she thought she did of Zora culture.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Golvara does not understand it, but the return of Soulsteel is an ominous portent, and the victory of Izu over the savages speaks to Wisest Nayru’s favor,” he said. “Reluctant as Golvara is to relinquish this treasure, the Whisperer-of-Worlds-Beyond has convinced him it is safer in your hands than his.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda found herself again at a loss for words. How was she supposed to respond to that? She stole a look to Shesan for help.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Finding the fragments and keeping them out of the hands of the enemy remains our top priority,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed,” Zelda said with a gracious nod. “On that note, I trust you have spoken…” she glanced over his shoulder towards the <i>Whisperer-of-Worlds-Beyond</i>, “about Link, and our hopes to rebuild the Lightsworn order?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Golvara gave a nod, but said nothing. Was he expecting more? Zelda took a moment to compose her thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Far to the Southwest, at the edge of the Gerudo desert, Link and his team found an abandoned temple that was once a Lightsworn training facility. He completed the trials there, obtained the blessing of Hylia—of sorts, and recovered a powerful ancient artifact as well as a handful of texts full of forgotten knowledge.” She paused, letting the words settle. “If not for their efforts there, I don’t believe we would have prevailed against the Blight. It was that knowledge that made it possible for Izu to defeat the Warlord.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another nod. Good. He was with her so far.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am given to believe there is another facility in the heart of the Zora’s Domain?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is,” Golvara confirmed. “It has been a great many years since the fall of the Lightsworn, and none have entered it since,” he said. “We speak of a time when Wisest Nineve was young. The Zora have continued to maintain the temple grounds and protect it as is our charge, though Golvara cannot say what has happened since the Corruption.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Their charge?</i> Hmm. Interesting. Something to follow up on later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded in return, careful not to speak too quickly in case that offended him. “We do not… <i>yet</i> have concrete plans, but I have considered sending an elite strike team to infiltrate the facility, in hopes that doing so may prove as valuable as Link’s visit to the Obsidian Spire. Perhaps therein may lie the key to defeating Ja’bu?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ⰄⰂ ⰩⰎ'ⰓⰉ ⰊⰬ'ⰈⰏ Ⱀ'Ⱉ' ⰃⰭ'ⰎⰍ ⰭⰃ'ⰌⰄ Ⱃ'ⰏⰈ Ⱌ'Ⰵ' Ⰼ'Ⱄ'Ⰲ Ⱄ'Ⱀ',” Golvara said, slipping into his native tongue.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress,</i> came Fi’s voice, <i>I believe Golvara is expressing frustration in the form of profanity.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have I… offended you?” Zelda ventured.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Golvara said tersely. “This… is no easy task. As you would say, ‘much easier said than done.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I acknowledge that,” Zelda said, “but it may be our only hope. Our generals expect our current campaign to wrap up within the month. It will be a long while still before we have stabilized, but once we have retaken Talus, we will be in a much better position strategically. By that point, we should have forces available to assist. Perhaps a diversionary strike elsewhere would suffice to draw attention and create an opening for the strike team?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Golvara nodded along as she spoke, clicking the tips of his fingers together. “This one does not specialize in warfare and tactics, but he recognizes wisdom in your words,” he said. “Golvara will bring your plan before the war council.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes!</i> He actually—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>But,</i>”—a mental sigh: there was always a ‘but’—“be warned: a direct assault upon the Domain will be costly. Expect bloodshed, and death by the thousands. Is this a cost the children of Hylia are willing to bear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A grim silence settled over them. It was always so much easier to deal in the abstract.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say for certain,” Zelda said after a moment of consideration. “I too must rely on counsel for these matters. If, when the time comes, this is our best course of action…” A slow, calming breath. “There is willingness to make that sacrifice, but the ultimate decision as to the plan’s feasibility rests with the Lord General.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well,” Golvara said. “We shall speak again when the time comes. May Nayru’s wisdom guide you, Queen Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And with that, he turned to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, then. Zelda waited a while to make sure he was out of earshot. “That was unexpected.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What did you expect?” Shesan asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Zelda huffed. “Last time we met, he treated me like a petulant child, and stormed off in protest when I asked for this.” She held up the fragment of Wisdom he had just delivered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Shesan said. “Well, last time you spoke, you were an ignorant and powerless beggar, asking for answers. Now… Well, he believes you to be a wise and powerful Queen, offering him solutions. Night and day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her subtle evasion was not lost on Zelda. She decided to change the subject: “What are your thoughts?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For the record,” Shesan said, crossing her arms and tilting her head with exaggerated affectation. “<i>I</i> am not certain this course of action would be the best use of our resources.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You think it’s a bad idea?” Zelda asked, raising an eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not at all,” Shesan said. “I just don’t know if it’s our best shot. As you say, what we find there could very well prove invaluable. However, it could just as easily turn up empty, and going up directly against a void entity as powerful as Ja’bu…” She waggled her hand. “It’s a commitment. A big one. High risk, uncertain reward. As a rule, I don’t like those.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, Ganondorf managed to kill Morudo Geira’s avatar. With the help of Demise, sure, but still.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I didn’t say it was impossible. Just… difficult.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda bit her lip. “How would you rank them?” she asked. “In comparison of power? If that’s something you’re willing to answer.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hard to say,” Shesan said. “It’s more a question of how <i>much</i> of them has gotten into the world. As to which is more powerful in absolute terms, I’m not sure it even matters to ask the question.” A nervous half-chuckle. “At the height of their power—let’s just say there’s a good reason you had a literal Goddess protecting you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said. Troubling. “I don’t suppose you know how much of Ja’bu has gotten into the world?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shook her head. “More than Geira, probably, given his hold over the corrupted Zora, but I can’t say for certain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a sigh. “So if we were to strike against him, we would want to do it sooner rather than later? How much time do we have before it’s too late? Is it too late?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Most likely not,” Shesan said. “We’re still talking on the order of years—decades, even—for them to build up appreciable power. And by ‘appreciable,’ I mean ‘world-threatening,’ not just destabilizing. Unless of course, the barrier protecting this world is weakened further. In which case Ja’bu, or other entities for that matter, could very well become major threats, as opposed to merely being distractions and thorns in our side.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right… wonderful,” Zelda said mirthlessly. “So you still believe the Triforce is our only hope?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ha. That implies I have hope,” Shesan said with a snort of laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head in disbelief. “How can you laugh about this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A shrug. “We all cope with it in different ways, Zelda. Not all of us find comfort in hope.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda met her eyes, and for the first time she felt an inkling of understanding, like she finally knew something about who this woman was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How did you get here?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not answering that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How long have you been here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A few years.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Look. If you want my life story, sorry to say, but you’re going to be waiting a while. Do you have any other questions pertaining to saving your world from its impending doom, or are we done for now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smirked at her. “Just one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you personally know of any magic that’s capable of sealing away void entities? Is that something you can do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blinked. “Really? Can you teach me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you have any spare void entities lying about in need of sealing?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… no. Obviously not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, if and when we find ourselves in that situation, I will be <i>delighted</i> to help. Goodbye, Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodbye, Shesan,” Zelda muttered to herself moments after the woman left.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sigh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned back to her journal. Where was she, again? Ah, right.</span>

<br>
<span><i><u>26th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Just as we were preparing to turn in last night, that’s when it hit me. Literally!</span>
<br><br>
<span>I was sitting under a tree with Sera and Laylith, idly chatting and enjoying the sunset, when a warblenut fell from the tree and landed in my cup, knocking it out of my hand and spilling tea everywhere.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was in that moment I had a brilliant idea for what I am calling the “Technique of Impending Doom!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Muahaha.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite the name, it’s not all that complicated or dangerous. Setup: the same experiments as above with Foretelling and Scrying. However, the practitioner sits under a pot of water. The pot has a support mechanism that is rigged to fail after a set amount of time. In this case—having limited materials on hand—I used a constant flow of water into a basin on a scale, offset by a known weight. When the basin fills to the correct height, the scale tips and tugs on some twine, which causes a stick supporting the pot to fall, thus dumping cold water all over me.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Foretelling while sitting under the pot with the mechanism active (with the intention of staying there the entire time) produces a constant, unsettling feeling. Obviously, the timer must be long enough to complete the task, but the longer the timer, the fainter the feeling. I conjecture that a more pressing danger would produce a stronger effect, but I’m also not about to hang a sword over my head or anything. I found that with practice and familiarity, it’s not too difficult to pick out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The key is this: after using Scry to locate that which one desires to locate, one then has reason to move out of danger. This ties the feedback from Foretelling not to the decisions of others, but to events happening entirely in the immediate vicinity and within one’s own mind. In other words, well within the boundaries that Foretelling is known to work in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I am delighted to report that with a bit of practice I was able to execute the technique reliably, and used it to succeed on all the prior tests! Admittedly, this isn’t all that useful for searching between four fixed locations—simply Scrying and moving the focus is much faster and less effortful. But this is where the technique shines! We scaled up the experiment, subdividing the outpost and the surrounding fishing village into sixteen regions, each about a hundred meters apart. Sixteen soldiers then chose amongst themselves which of them were to wear a colorful bandana, then each went somewhere within their designated subarea.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took a while to calibrate and find a suitable cadence, striking a balance between leaving enough time for the trial but still having strong enough feedback. I really must stress the importance of this: after a while, it becomes very easy to imagine the feeling of unease and delude oneself into thinking it is feedback from Foretelling. In testing, I found that five-second intervals (plus a comfortable buffer) was enough to reliably perform the ritual on each subarea and clear the mind before moving on to the next. I also had to use a metronome to ensure I kept the correct pacing, and it was quite difficult to focus on everything all at once.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once the kinks were worked out, as before I was able to locate the target correctly on the first try: number ten. Confident in my success, we then scaled up and did it again, this time with thirty-two subareas (though we had to rope in some villagers to help). Again, resounding success: number twenty-six!</span>
<br><br>
<span>…And here’s where we run into the limitations. That is to say, the same limitation as always: availability of magic. The first batch of tests exhausted my own reserves and all those of the local mages via Siphon (including Cove and Laylith). On top of that, I required Fi’s assistance during the sixteen and thirty-two trials.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sixteen trial, I’m pretty sure I could do on my own if I started from full reserves, as could most skilled practitioners, particularly those with higher affinities. However, even I needed Fi to have any hope of completing the thirty-two trial, thus making it completely infeasible for anyone else to attempt, let alone succeed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(There is the possibility of using Siphon in the middle of the technique, but given the already difficult nature and the required focus of the practitioner, I can’t imagine that would work well.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>There also doesn’t seem to be any way to cheat the scheme with clever tricks, such as progressively splitting the search area into halves and only considering each half at a time. If it worked that way, one would only need five iterations to search an entire size thirty-two grid. Alas, after drenching myself half a dozen times, I’m calling it quits for now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It seems that the act of actually locating the target via Scrying is what provides the sense of relief (or rather, Foretelling picking up on the imminent <i>possibility</i> of doing so just before you actually do it). Therefore, if the subarea to be searched is half the entire area, there isn’t much advantage to using the technique versus just Scrying the whole area to begin with. One is therefore limited to fixed areas and regular intervals. That is to say, it doesn’t matter which order you consider them in, just that you actually consider each of them, and give yourself enough time to do so.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To summarize: if one has excess magic to burn, then I have fairly conclusively proven that the Technique of Impending Doom can considerably cut down on the time needed to exhaustively Scry a large area by a factor proportional to the number of subareas. However, it is rarely if ever the case that anyone has excess magic, but not enough time. Thus—as is the case with so many of my clever ideas—it solves the wrong problem.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I swear, I am cursed.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>It was a small thing, but Link was immensely grateful to be marked again. It put his mind at ease. For the longest time, he was worried that he would be cast aside after his failure at the haunted pass. After his injury. After Izu’s success. Despite knowing it was only his fears and insecurities talking, the thoughts felt impossible to shake. He suspected—and Ryn kept insisting—that the “spiritual” component of his wound played no small part in his anguish.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But that couldn’t stop his mind from wandering to dark places whenever he was idle for too long.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Staying active had helped. Talking it out with Ryn had helped. Visiting Malon and being at Lon Lon again had helped. But this was different. This felt <i>real</i>—not like just another distraction to keep his mind occupied. Having his connection to Fi—to Hylia—restored, felt symbolic. It meant that he was back on track, back to his mission of unlocking his potential and discovering more about the Lightsworn order.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He needed this. By the Mother, he needed this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Below him, Epona huffed and shook her snout to the side. Link smiled and patted her neck as he guided her to the edge of town. He’d only be taking her as far as Hylia’s Watch—the terrain further afield would be better traversed by oxgoats, and Malon would be devastated if he allowed any harm to come to the mare besides. Still, he felt an odd sense of comfort around Epona, and she took kindly to him. He remembered tending to her as a foal back in his youth, and it seemed she remembered him as well. It was rare for a rider to have that kind of bond with a steed, and he was thankful to Malon for allowing Epona to join him this far on his journey.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As they approached the town gates, Link noticed the others already waiting and assembled around their cart. Oh no—was he late? There was still a good half hour before dawn. He nudged Epona into a trot, but slowed back down once he saw that Izu and Ryn had yet to arrive.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Phew.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu still had a few days left before he would be in fighting shape, but it would take about that long to get to their destination, and they didn’t expect much trouble along the way. Fiends, Blin, or bandits at worst. Certainly nothing the eight of them couldn’t handle—and that was before taking into account Fi or the transfabrulator. As for Link, they couldn’t wait around for however long it would take for his arm to fully heal. The Mother only knew how long that would be.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Slowly, he stretched and flexed his fingers. It still hurt like all hell, but there was no way it was all in his mind: His connection to Fi really was speeding up his recovery. He still wasn’t in any kind of shape to fight giant monsters or undergo feats of endurance like in the last temple, but that wouldn’t get in the way of them traveling and hopefully gaining more critically useful information once they arrived. They’d have to play the rest by ear and, Goddesses willing, he would be ready when the time came.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…So then the barkeep says, ‘I would sir, but we don’t serve grubbers here!’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yawn. Heard it,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I thought it was funny,” Gazra said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, see? I always knew you had good taste,” Jedal said to a round of laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, you got me there,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link rode up and waved to the group.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If it isn’t the man of the hour!” Jedal said. “We were just talking about you. Say, what’s it like to be a Lightsworn, anyway?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All eyes turned to him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh…” Link started, feeling caught off guard. “I’m not sure I am yet? I still have to unlock my full potential. That’s why we’re going to the temples.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mate, you can Invigorate while using a sword,” Jedal said. “Fick me if that ain’t the most terrifyingly badass thing I’ve ever heard.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “Supposedly real Lightsworn glow with the golden light of the Goddesses.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Like the Queen, during the first siege?” Kellin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah? I think? Except… the Queen’s not a Lightsworn either. That was…” He scratched his head. “We’re not sure what that was, actually. Hylia channeling her power through Zelda directly? Something like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, if we find any more of those silvery eggs, I’ll be the first to volunteer,” Jedal said. He chuckled and glanced around the group. “What do you think my hidden potential is? Personally I’m hoping to shoot energy beams out me eyes!” He leaned forward and stuck his neck out, glaring bug-eyed at everyone while grinning. “Eh, eh?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lightsworn don’t shoot energy beams out of their eyes, you dolt,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And how are you so certain, lass?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I dunno,” Koja said sarcastically. “Have you ever heard stories of Lightsworn shooting energy beams out of their eyes? I sure haven’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal’s eyes lit up. “As a matter of fact, my ma used to tell us a bedtime story. Well, more of a cautionary tale, really.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja groaned loudly. She and Kellin exchanged glances, both rolling their eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal turned to his side and slapped Gazra on the chest. “What about you, boss? What do you think your hidden power is?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra grunted and gave a noncommittal shrug.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Knowing him, partial transformation,” Grenja said. “If you know what I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The awkward silence was broken by simultaneous snorts of laughter from Gazra and Jedal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nice,” Gazra said, bumping fists with Grenja.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Boys will be boys,” Koja muttered. Kellin sighed and paced away from the group.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link smiled. Seeing Grenja more lively and animated again eased his mind. They had all been really worried for him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Approaching hoofbeats. Link turned to see Ryn riding up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahoy, hoy!” she called. “Captain’s still visiting with his family. Said to go ahead—he’ll catch up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, you heard the lass!” Jedal said, climbing into the driver’s seat of the cart. “Let’s get this train a-movin!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A bead of sweat pooled over Link’s brow and trickled down his cheek. He sized up his opponent, setting his feet and lowering his shoulders. Across from him stood a towering horned beast—a bipedal monstrosity that was to an oxgoat as a grubber was to a Moblin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra’s altered form did the same from the opposite end of the training circle, lowering his curved horns, letting out a snort of hot air, and pawing the ground as he prepared to charge. Even with his right arm tied behind his back to even the odds, it was an imposing sight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ready…” Koja’s voice came. “Steady… Fight!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Time slowed to a crawl as Link’s magic burst alight within his veins. He dug into the ground and launched himself forward, taking three quick strides to close the distance. Ahead, Gazra barreled towards him at frightening speed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was absolutely no way Link could win in a straight-up contest of strength, so he would need to rely on finesse and cunning. But Gazra knew that as well, and would be expecting a feint. Link read his opponent and let his instincts take over at the last instant, ducking in under Gazra’s guard and shoving into his side with everything he had to throw the man off balance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra faltered, but then braced himself and swung down with a massive fist, forcing Link to stumble back and disengage. And before Link could recover, Gazra was right on top of him, pressing the attack. Even with his heightened reflexes, he only narrowly dodged an attempted grab, and was forced to burn more magic to keep from being boxed-in. Gazra was not making it easy on him. Another charge and another swipe, and it was everything Link could do to keep his balance and avoid being grappled or knocked out of the ring.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He managed though, breaking away and circling around to put distance between them. Link’s heart pounded in his chest. He wasn’t sure how much more of this he could take. He could feel his reserves running dry, and by the rules of the match, Fi couldn’t restore them. He eased up on the burn to avoid exhausting himself, and immediately regretted it as Gazra closed in again before he had a chance to formulate a plan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In his mind’s eye, Link saw one path: His first instinct was to sidestep the charge and attempt to counter. In that reality, Gazra came down on top of him and pinned him to the ground. He thought to try the same thing from the other direction, but he had no space to maneuver, and that vision ended with a massive clawed hand around his neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With few options and no time, Link decided to dig in and stand his ground. Instinctively, his muscles tensed and flexed in perfect synchronicity to absorb and redirect the initial shock of their collision. He grabbed Gazra by the horns, grit his teeth, and let out a primal <i>“HYAAAAAAA!”</i> as he dropped his weight and spun his hips to—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Ooof!</i> —Catch an open-handed palm to the chest, knocking him flat on his back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Winded, Link sat up, coughing and wheezing. His head throbbed something fierce, and he was seeing double. Gazra held out a hand to help him up. Link graciously took it, and with it came a very welcome and generous surge of magic, staving off his exhaustion. “Thanks. Good… good fight,” he said between breaths.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra grunted and raised his chin. “Impressive.” His voice in this altered form was deep, guttural, and rough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Holy fick that was awesome,” Ryn said, as she and the others strode up from the sidelines. “I really thought he had you there for a moment.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link smiled graciously as he accepted a cool, damp towel and a water skin from Jedal. “Anything broken?” the man asked. Link shook his head and Jedal gave him a wink and a gentle pat on the shoulder before returning to his duties.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmph. He needs more magic,” Gazra said with a snort. “Ran out too quickly. Strong, fast, threatening. No endurance.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded. “Yeah, that’s a big weakness,” he agreed. “I never had a need to focus on my reserves before. And since… everything, it’s been enough to rely on Fi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think meditation exercises would help?” Ryn offered. “Izu would probably be best for that. If you can catch him awake, anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, that ain’t it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned and looked expectantly to Grenja, waiting for further explanation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By all means,” Koja said teasingly. “Whenever you’re done stroking your ego.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sis, and I mean this in the most loving way possible,” Grenja said with a smirk. “Shove it. Anyway.” He cleared his throat. “Your capacity could use some work, but that’s not your bottleneck. You’re too…” He rubbed his chin. “How do I put this delicately. It’s like using a sledgehammer to crack open a warblenut.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Makes sense,” Link said, furrowing his brow. “So you’re saying… I need to attenuate my magic at critical moments? Rather than a constant burn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Exactamente,” Grenja said, crossing his arms and standing tall. “Couldn’t have put it better myself. It’ll take a while to get the hang of it, and I expect you’ll puke your guts out the first few tries before you get used to the vertigo. But I have faith in you. Training starts an hour before dawn.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link groaned under his breath. He could viscerally imagine what that would feel like, with his perception of time and sense of gravity and balance switching rapidly. If it was anything like practicing Scrying, he wasn’t in for a good time.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link stirred awake as Ryn donned her equipment and left their shared tent. No doubt she was trying to avoid waking him on her way out to watch duty, but Link was a light sleeper on the best of nights. He yawned, rolled over, and closed his eyes, trying to get back to sleep.</span>
<br><br>
<span>About fifteen minutes of unproductively staring at the back of his eyelids later, he sat up, stretched, and got dressed instead. It was only a couple hours before his scheduled training with Grenja, and he had been meaning to talk with Ryn alone for a while now. He wasn’t sure why, but she felt more distant than usual lately, and that made him uncomfortable.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link got a running start and clambered up the steep chest-high cliffside at the edge of camp, making ample noise on his way up to avoid spooking her. As expected, Ryn was in the middle of Scrying, sitting with her legs crossed and blank white eyes staring up at the heavens. Link sat patiently at her side, waiting for her to finish.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A slow, deep breath. “So.” Ryn said, blinking rapidly as her eyes came back into focus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So? …So what?” Link asked, puzzled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn shook her head. “How was your time at Lon Lon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link paused to think. He hadn’t expected that subject to come up again. “It was nice,” he said. “It’s hard to explain, but I feel like I really connected with my past, you know? And I worked through some stuff that always used to eat at me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn nodded along. She leaned back on her hands and stared off into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is there something wrong?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn let out a sigh. “What do you think?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s about Malon, isn’t it?” Link said. He had been thinking about that off and on since Izu pointed it out to him. “Are you jealous? Because you don’t have to be. We’re just friends, I swear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She laughed. “Why would I be jealous? You can see Malon all you want. However you want. I don’t mind.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Link boggled at her. “…Really? —I mean, not that I <i>want</i> to, but, uh…” Damnation. How to keep from sticking his foot in his mouth?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn waved a hand. “Look, I told you I’m not into the committed relationship thing. I thought we agreed on that. What you do or don’t do with Malon or anyone else is your business. I just wanted…” She paused, huffed, and then waved her hand again. “Nevermind.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You wanted…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s nothing. Forget it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Buzzhoppers chirped in the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Okay then,</i> Link thought to himself. It didn’t sound like nothing, but if she didn’t want to talk about it, then he wasn’t going to press.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother, he would never understand women.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tried and failed to think of another conversational topic, but just as he was preparing to leave, the glint of her necklace in the moonlight caught his eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, what’s that?” Link asked, gesturing. “I’ve noticed you wearing it for a while now—where’d you get it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hm?” Ryn said. “Oh, this?” She held out the jade pendant to examine it. “Not sure. I think I found it when we… were leaving… the… umm… Hmm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded once to herself, hung her head, sighed, unclasped the chain, then reared back and flung it into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, Ryn? What the heck?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn buried her face in her palms. “I’m so stupid. I can’t believe—fick, it’s probably cursed or something! I don’t even know how I got it. I just found it after our run-in with Ibboso.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And there were the buzzhoppers again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fick.” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yeah!</i>” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why do you think it’s cursed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well for starters, I couldn’t see my reflection in it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?! And you didn’t tell anyone?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>The thought literally did not cross my mind!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yeah!</i>” Ryn said, standing and pacing back and forth. “Fick, Link! What do we do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s hand went to his head. “I don’t know. Uh… Fi? Help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi’s chromatic form materialized from the aether. “How can I be of assistance, Master?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stammered. He pointed off in the distance towards where Ryn threw the pendant, then back at Ryn. “Did you notice the green pendant Ryn was wearing before just now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course,” Fi said with a twirl.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And did you notice anything odd about it?” Ryn asked. “Or me, for that matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scratched his head. Ryn did the same.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you see where I threw it?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you lead us there?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi gave a nod and floated off about thirty feet. Link and Ryn looked at each other, then scrambled after her. It only took a moment of searching in the brush to find the pendant again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Careful,” Ryn said, holding out a hand as Link went to grab it. “Here—let me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You sure?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It hasn’t hurt me yet,” Ryn said. “At least, I don’t think it has.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded and stepped back. Ryn retrieved the pendant by its chain and held it out at arm’s length.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, can you scan it or something?” Link asked. “We think it might be cursed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly. One moment.” Her colors shifted from purple and pink to teal and back again as she hovered around the pendant. “It appears to be magically inert,” she said, “but I cannot be certain without attempting to infuse it with Void Power.” She turned back to Link. “Master, given the circumstances, I must recommend against this approach, at least until we are able to proceed in a more controlled environment. Perhaps a safer alternative, though marginally more costly and less conclusive, would be to use the stone tablet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course!” Ryn said. “Fi, you’re a genius.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded in agreement, fishing the tablet from a pouch at his side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Wait, how did this work again?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whenever you are ready, Master.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hesitated. “How much will it cost? Should we consult with Zelda first?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Eleven units of Void Power will be sufficient to power the device for one second in near-range omnidirectional detection mode. One-hundred and twenty-eight units of Void Power would be sufficient to power the device for three seconds in active scan mode, thereafter falling back to near-range omnidirectional detection mode for ten minutes. This usage falls well within my standard operating procedures. Zelda is currently sleeping, though if you deem it appropriate I can attempt to wake her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh… no, that’s okay,” Link said. “Though if anything unexpected happens, go ahead.” Fi nodded in affirmation. “Do we need to use the scan mode, or do you think the… omnidirectional mode is sufficient?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The lower power mode should suffice: 96.7% certainty,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, then. Go ahead,” Link said. “Twenty units—that should give us a minute, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative,” Fi said. She did as requested, twirling in place as chromatic vapors trailed from her ethereal form into the device.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It buzzed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait,” Link said. “Where’s the transfabrulator?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think Koja had it last?” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded, then stepped away. The buzzing grew fainter. He motioned for her to set down the pendant and back away. The buzzing remained constant. He stepped closer, and it grew stronger again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whelp,” Ryn said, going pale. “I guess that proves it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed,” Fi said, shifting hues. “Given the object’s likely origin, I advise proceeding with utmost caution. I will remain alert, and inform Zelda at the earliest opportunity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks, Fi,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is my pleasure to serve, Master,” Fi said as her form dissipated back into the aether.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I guess that answers that,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep,” Ryn echoed. “So what now?”</span>
<br><br> 
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“<i>Cursed?!</i>” Grenja gulped.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Relax, bro,” Koja said. “It hasn’t consumed anyone’s soul yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They all stood around the pendant, left sitting atop a stump. Link wasn’t sure if he should be comforted or horrified that none of their reflections were visible on its surface.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I vote we destroy it,” Grenja said. “No sense taking chances.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We can’t destroy it,” Kellin said. “It could be a priceless artifact. Or if it is related to Fae, that might release it, and that’s the last thing we need.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link did a double take. He had to remind himself that she was a Seeker.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seeing as you’re the expert here,” Izu said, “what do you recommend?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin considered for a long moment. “Ryn: You’re the only one who’s touched it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Ryn answered sheepishly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good,” Kellin said. “That limits our exposure. Nothing’s happened thus far, and given Fi’s analysis, we can assume it’s dormant.” She nodded to herself. “I advise wrapping it up and keeping it locked in a box on your person. Don’t let it come into direct contact with you or anyone else again. And we’ll need to keep an eye on you at all times, at least until we get to Hylia’s Watch and can make further plans. There’s enough of us—that shouldn’t be a problem.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Roger,” Ryn said, taking the pendant and folding it up in a scarf. “Do we have a lockbox?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negatory,” Jedal said. “Not going by inventory, anyway. Anyone?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No.” / “Nope.” / “Not me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A pouch, then,” Kellin said. “Just make sure to keep it from being damaged.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Will do,” Ryn said with a lazy salute.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. It wasn’t ideal, but he supposed it was the best they could do for the time being. The haunted pass was literally a place of nightmares, and activating a mysterious magical artifact associated with that place while out in the middle of nowhere was in fact the last thing they needed. With luck, it would remain dormant until they got somewhere safer and figured out what to do with it.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Holy Mother,</i> Link prayed, <i>please let her be okay.</i></span>
<br><br>
