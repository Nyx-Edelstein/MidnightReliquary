<span>“I can’t… I don’t…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It pained Link to see Zelda stumble and falter in front of so many people, at such a critical moment no less. The Queen was many things, but a decisive leader she was not. This was terrible news, and he could only imagine her shock at learning that one of her more portentous dreams had come true. But right now everyone was looking to <i>her</i> for guidance and direction, and she wasn’t exactly inspiring confidence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, everyone! Listen up!” Izu shouted to his side, stepping up to take command. “We’re stopping to make camp until further direction. Get to it! Tham, Gref, Narr,” he pointed to three men standing near one of the carts as soldiers all around them broke into action. “Set up a makeshift war room, post haste. Someone go find Laylith, Koja—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Here, sir!” Koja called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about Laylith? Malg, Ryn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ryn’s on her way back. Others still out on recon,” she answered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Find them quickly, please.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, right away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hesitated, wondering what he should be doing right now. Helping set up camp? Canvassing the area? Probably that. He should—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, where are you going?” came Izu’s voice behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link spun, feeling uncertain. “Uh, sorry, what’s the plan?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Emergency meeting? War room?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, right,” Where was his mind today? He jogged back over to where Izu was standing with Zelda and the messenger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You okay, buddy?” Cove asked, coming up from behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, sorry,” Link said, stifling a yawn. “Just tired. Was up early training, and it’s hard to get rest on the road.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A hearty clap on his back almost sent him stumbling forward. Grenja. “Don’t sweat it, my man! You’ll get used to it in no time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link glanced back to Izu, who only eyed him reproachfully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, bodies parted as Naibi rode up with her guard at a canter. “What is this?” she called. “Why are we stopped?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This is official, <i>Hylian</i> business,” the messenger started, “I’ll have to ask that you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What he means to say,” Cove interrupted, moving quickly to interpose himself between the two, “is that we just got news back from the capital. Bad news. Really bad. We’re still figuring out what to do about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And why was I not told?” She sounded irritated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Literally</i> just happened,” Cove said, raising his palms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She grunted and muttered something no doubt invective as she hopped down from her horse. “Well?” she asked, looking expectant. “Are you going to fill me in?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Cove looked back to Izu. Izu looked to Zelda, then Link. Link shrugged. “I think we have to?” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You <i>can’t</i> be serious,” Grenja said, lowering his voice. “Never mind protocol. Even if this wasn’t a matter of state security, we don’t know if she can be trusted.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can <i>hear</i> you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They all turned to face Zelda. She seemed to have finally broken out of her spell and come to her senses.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” she repeated firmly. Her voice was cold; distant. “We don’t know how much we can trust her, but we have to anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” the messenger interjected, “are you certain—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am,” she said, not giving him time to finish. “Naibi and her tribe will be embroiled personally in these matters soon enough, assuming they still wish to go through with our deal. It would send the wrong message not to include her in the discussion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Wonderful.</i> Now that this is settled,” Naibi said impertinently, “will someone tell me what in <i>damnation</i> is going on?”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“As I said, the details are still unfolding,” Olvas, the messenger from Last Bastion said. He, Zelda, Link, Izu, Naibi, and all six of her Sheikah guard huddled together around a small table in a large tent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We don’t know much, but there was an attack on the Zora’s Domain. A large group of them were ‘turned,’ and the majority fled in response. They are claiming it was a <i>voidspawn</i>, or something of that nature. Ja’bu?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Turned Zora</i>? That was… worrisome.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ja’bu, yes” Zelda said, recalling her journey to speak with Nineve what seemed like a lifetime ago. “Golvara told me of it—the Zora emissary, when I went to meet with them concerning my dreams. ‘<i>A great evil, long thought dormant</i>,’ is what he said. He refused to give me any other details, but assured me not to worry and that it would be handled.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Typical Zora,” Laylith said with a huff.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, the refugees,” Olvas continued, “I needn’t tell you how dire the situation is. We’re already struggling—and failing—to feed our own people and to keep the countryside safe from the Blin. Not to mention the war effort. And they’re pouring in by the <i>thousands</i>. No one knows how many exactly, and most of them refuse to speak to us. Your Grace, you <i>must</i> come back with me immediately and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do not think that will be happening,” Naibi asserted, folding her arms. “Zelda, surely you have subordinates you can trust to handle this until you return, yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, theoretically?” Zelda could sense Naibi’s growing displeasure, and didn’t even want to think about what the woman might do if she did decide to return before the meeting. “But you must understand,” she said, “this is an extraordinary situation. Wymar and Adresin—the Lord General and the Queen’s Justice—are busy handling the war effort and fighting on the front. My Prime Councilor has his hands full working to forestall a famine, and the rest of my council have reconstruction and public morale to contend with. We’re already stretched thin as it is.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is only <i>one</i> day further. A refugee crisis is hardly—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Naibi, enough,” Zelda said, softly but firmly. She did not have the patience for this. “We are only discussing options,” she said. “I know how important all this is, and I <i>do</i> want to meet with the Lynx. I also know you will not accept delaying the meeting further. But don’t worry; even if I do need to return immediately, Link will continue in my stead. He is also the chosen of Hylia and has my full confidence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hoped that would appease Naibi. The Gerudo woman eyed her, grumbling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” she said. “As you say. He will do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a sigh of relief. Now that that was out of the way…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How long has it been since we first got word?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“About four hours, I believe,” Olvas replied.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are the Zora asking anything… specific of us?” Zelda wondered aloud, leaving the obvious unsaid. Whatever this was, her kingdom could hardly afford to get tangled up in <i>another</i> war right now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not that I’m aware. We have asked; they’re just not particularly forthcoming. They’re more or less just squatting along the coasts, mostly around Lake Hylia. Though, a sizable contingent has set up a checkpoint at Hylia’s Watch.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are they expecting another attack?” Link asked. “Should <i>we</i> be worried about an attack?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who’s to say?” Olvas shrugged. “We’ve already begun to prepare for the worst. But from what I gather, they don’t seem particularly concerned about additional attacks. It’s hard to tell exactly from the communications, but their main goal seems to be regrouping and seeking shelter while they figure out what to do about the rest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Would it kill them to be less obtuse?” Laylith opined.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We absolutely should prepare for the worst,” Naibi said. “Or have you not been paying attention?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually I was just thinking that,” Link said. “It <i>does</i> seem like too much of a coincidence. What are the chances of this happening <i>right now</i>? Unrelated to the other events? Especially with your dreams, Zelda. This has to be <i>fate</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Finally, someone gets it!” Naibi said. “I like this one. Can I keep him?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grunted as Cove jabbed at his side.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Fate.</i> Was this really all some cosmic scheme set up by the Goddesses?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As much as I hate to admit it, you have a point,” Zelda said. “Whatever this is, it is much bigger than us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And how much worse was it going to get before it was all over?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have to admit, she has a point too,” Izu said from across the table. “Realistically, what can you do from out here? It’s going to take another week to get back to Castletown at the earliest. If the whole thing <i>is</i> set to explode, I’d put odds on it doing so sooner rather than later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Even so, at least heading back to Last Bastion would reduce delay in passing information back and forth,” Laylith countered. “That’s better than nothing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Lynx’s camp isn’t all that far from Last Bastion,” another voice said. Ryn; Zelda had to remind herself of the name. The black-haired Sheikah girl had mostly kept to herself the entire journey, often opting to go alone on reconnaissance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Ooh, that <i>was</i> clever.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you suggesting what I think you’re suggesting?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn nodded. “Between the crew there and us, we should be able to set up a makeshift scry-line to keep information flowing. Would only add a few minutes’ delay, and would let you continue on. Best of both worlds.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, that’s not bad!” Cove said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I <i>suppose</i> that could work,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>That also means fewer guards when you meet with her,</i> Laylith’s voice sounded in Zelda’s mind. <i>Are you certain?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let me guess,” Naibi said to Laylith, seeming to take note of the transmission. “The loyal bitch frets for its owner’s safety, heading so perilously into the Lynel’s den?” She put on a mock frown, clutching at her chest. “Sheikah, you wound me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Laylith, thank you for the concern, but we need not worry,” Zelda said quickly, trying to get ahead of another spat. “Does anyone have any thoughts on what to do about the situation at hand?” She had to admit even she was drawing blanks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Maybe there’s a silver lining here?” Cove suggested. “It would be great if we could get them to help out with defense along the coasts.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And how do you propose we get them to do that?” Grenja asked pointedly. “They’re currently on the run from an ancient voidspawn and trying to figure out how to retake their homeland from a contingent of evil Zora that have been tainted by the Void. Fighting our battles doesn’t sound like it’s going to be high on their priority list.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I dunno, I’m not an expert,” Cove said. “We could offer them more fish?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right, so let me get this straight,” Grenja replied. “You’re proposing we offer the aquatic race of fish-people—who practically live underwater and can swim way better than any Hylian—more fish. More of the fish they can and will just <i>take</i>, without so much as asking. That about right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I get it, okay?” Cove said, flustered. “Knock it off man.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But if they’re squatting on the coasts, they’ll at least care about defending the surrounding areas from the Blin, yeah?” Izu offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Or just settle on the opposite coast,” Koja said. “’s what I’d do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The table broke into murmurs as the group steadily came to the same consensus that Zelda had already reached: they really didn’t have any leverage here. They couldn’t force the Zora out nor contain them. They had nothing of value to offer them, and everything Zelda knew about them said they would view any offers of direct aid as more of a hindrance than a boon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, if I may,” Malg spoke up, striding over to lean against the table. All eyes turned to him. Zelda could already tell she wasn’t going to like this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re all so focused on what to do,” he said, “I fear we are ignoring the plain and simple truth: there is nothing we <i>can</i> do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well not with that atti—” Cove stopped short as Malg closed his eyes and held up a hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am not suggesting we do nothing; only that it is unlikely to turn out well, regardless of what <i>is</i> done. As we all know, the Zora are not known for their tact, nor for their openness. Many among the populace will not take well to them squatting on our lands, eating our food, and all-but telling us to sod off. The people are pressured enough as is. There will be more than enough suspicion and mistrust to go around.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head solemnly. “No; this has all the makings of a disaster. It is not a question of <i>if</i> it will turn out poorly, but rather <i>when</i>. We must instead ask ourselves: how can we get ahead of this? How best can we mitigate the severity of the inevitable?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>As much as she did not want to face that truth, Zelda had to admit he was probably right. Her people were stressed. Few among them actually understood the Zora, least of all the general populace. Getting <i>nobles</i> to deal with their scorn and derision would be like herding remlits, and she wasn’t keen on the prospect of leaving diplomacy to people like Lensa.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was there anyone she could trust to keep the situation from souring in her absence?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Not really. But she also had to ask herself: did she want to leave Link to meet with the Lynx by himself?</span>
<br><br>
<span>…No, she didn’t. That was too important.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And did she really want to be away from him <i>at all</i> when her safety was the least bit in question?</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Nope.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a long shot, but there were two Zora among the Order of Sages. Rutilo and Vulas; a married pair Zelda had met on occasion while studying under Amaurath. Unfortunately however, Zelda knew they were much more socialized to Hylian values than Zora, and also that their kind wasn’t looked upon favorably by mainstream Zora culture.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Still, it was better than nothing. There would be consequences to be sure; delegating official power directly to the Faith in any capacity would have consequences, and many among the Council would not take well to her sidestepping them entirely. But it had to be done.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The entire tent had gone silent; all attention was on her. Everyone seemed to be expecting a royal decree. Was she <i>that</i> transparent?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled to herself. She supposed she could deliver on that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Olvas, send word to Last Bastion immediately,” she commanded. “I am putting High Priestess Vestele in charge of diplomatic relations with the Zora. Relay my command to her: she is to work with the Council and do everything in her power to keep tensions from rising until a lasting arrangement can be made. I am certain she will do this of her own accord, but instruct her to make use of Sages Rutilo and Vulas as necessary. She has the full authority of the Crown fulfil her charge.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace,” Olvas said. He stood and bowed. “As you command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn got her attention and raised a finger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, and one more thing,” she added. “Ryn will go with you. I know Last Bastion is understaffed, but do what you can to set up a temporary scry-line to the Lynx’s camp as we discussed. Keep me apprised of any news. Ryn, do you need anything?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just some muscle,” Ryn said. “I should be able to handle relaying the messages myself. Maybe.” She frowned. “ …Actually, we might need Malg too. Just to be safe. Probably best to keep Laylith on your end.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Take Grenja and Cove with you too then.” She turned to the men. “Is that enough?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Absolutely, Your Grace!” Cove said cheerfully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think between us we can handle a few nasties if it comes to it,” Grenja said with a grin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Excellent!” Zelda said with an enthusiasm she did not feel. “With luck, this might buy us some time.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Laylith, a moment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith turned around just as she was exiting the tent with the others. “Absolutely. What’s on your mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Anxiously, Zelda reached into the satchel at her feet and withdrew her journal. She ran her fingers over its leather cover as she tried to calm her nerves.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She could do this. She didn’t want to, but she <i>had</i> to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith must have sensed her distress, as she immediately walked over and sat back at her side. “Hey, it’s okay,” she said. “I—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—This is <i>difficult</i> for me,” Zelda said tersely, keeping her eyes fixed on the journal in her lap. “As you know, the fragments of Wisdom I carry bestow me with prophetic dreams. But not all of my dreams can be prophetic.” Her lips drew to a rueful grin. “At least, I hope not.” She looked up. Laylith was listening attentively, and nodded. Zelda continued.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Some are… personal. Some are embarrassing. Others are almost certainly just random nonsense. And before now, even the prophetic ones were rarely important. But in light of the circumstances, I’ve been keeping a diary of them the past few weeks, and…” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“And you’d like help figuring out which are which?” Laylith offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know I would be more than happy to help.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt herself tearing up and turned away. <i>Breathe.</i> Why was this so hard? Why was <i>she</i> being the difficult one?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She felt a hand on her shoulder. “It’s alright,” Laylith said. “Really, it is. We all have dreams about all manner of crazy things. Whatever it is, I won’t judge.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not…” Zelda started, not knowing how to finish the sentence. She shook her head, turning back. “No, I know. I don’t know what’s gotten into me. I don’t know why I’m making such a fuss. It’s not that big of a big deal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She met the older woman’s eyes and saw her own pain reflected in them. Laylith’s voice was soft, barely above a whisper when she spoke. “You used to share them with Impa didn’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, covering her mouth and doing a miserable job at keeping herself composed. She couldn’t help it—she couldn’t hold it back. The tears came.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Immediately, Laylith was at her side. “I know, sweetie,” she said softly. Zelda rested against her shoulder and Laylith held her, running her fingers through her hair. “Shhh. I know. It’s okay. You can let it out.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A ragged breath escaped her chest. She clutched Laylith tight, sobbing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just a moment was all it took. Just a moment, and she was able to get herself under control again. Zelda straightened up, wiping at her face with the backs of her palms. “Thank you,” she half-whispered. “I needed that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t mention it,” Laylith said with a sweet smile. “Listen, I know I can never take her place. No one can. But if you ever need an ear—or just a shoulder to cry on? I’m here for you. Always. No questions asked.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t tell you how much I appreciate that,” Zelda said, feeling herself tearing up again. Laylith passed over a handkerchief, and Zelda readily accepted it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh, I’m such a mess!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So? Even queens are allowed to be messes sometimes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stop that,” Zelda said, rolling her eyes and trying not to smile. “People aren’t allowed to be so understanding.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Normally, no,” Laylith said as a matter-of-fact. “But I’m Sheikah. We have special training.” She caught Zelda’s eye and they both laughed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Goddess Above, how much she missed her only true friend.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked down at her journal and wiped the cover clean. Thankfully it had spared the entries inside from the wrath of her tears. Before she could reconsider, she flipped it open to the correct section and handed it over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please. Before I change my mind,” Zelda said, wincing slightly as she felt it leave her hands. “It starts on the entry for the eighth of Last Brisk. The day I got my bracers back.”</span>
<br><br>

</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>8th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I found myself sitting in a carriage on a winding road following a ravine, not knowing how I had gotten there. I heard voices at the front, and was excited to find the driver and passenger were none other than Father and Mother.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They didn’t respond when I tried calling out to them, so I opened the front hatch. Suddenly, it was nighttime and a cold wind blew in my face. I attempted to get Mother’s attention, but found only a wailing corpse in her place. The sound… even now, just thinking about it sends chills down my spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I fell screaming back into the cabin, and landed on Father’s stiff body. I jumped and spun back around. His eyes followed me as he pointed off into the distance, and I heard another screech. Before I knew what was happening, the carriage sped up and then fell into the ravine.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>10th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I awoke on a cliffside overlooking Lake Hylia. The sun was setting in the distance. Behind me, I heard shuffling of arms and stamping of feet. I turned to find an army of skeletal warriors marching towards me. Towards the cliff.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I yelled, but they wouldn’t stop. I tried to go around them, but they moved with me. I tried to push past them, but was knocked back. They edged nearer and nearer, until the entire cliff gave way and we all plunged into the river below.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>11th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I dreamt that Impa and I were riding away from Castletown on horseback. We were in a hurry, on the run from… something. I can’t remember.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Storm clouds gathered over the castle, and thunder rumbled ominously in the distance. I had a vague impression we were headed towards Kakariko, but there were no recognizable landmarks around me to judge by. Even the city looked unfamiliar. Ahead, a sea of grass stretched to the horizon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa hummed her song to me as we rode. The one she used to sing me to sleep with when I was a child.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>12th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I was sitting on the banks of Lake Hylia, watching children at play. It was a nice warm day, in the middle of Flows.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Suddenly, the sky went dark and the moon overhead turned a deep, blood red. The children disappeared, and corpses and dead fish began washing ashore. The surface of the lake bubbled and boiled, then swelled up like a rising tide. I tried to run for higher ground, but it kept rising and rising until everything was drowned in its waters.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>13th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I was with Link, making a last minute shopping trip at the markets in Castletown before leaving on our journey.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The first stall we came to was staffed by a mother and her young child. They were selling an assortment of pastries and sweets. The mother was wearing a simple blue sundress that flaunted her curves, and she had <i>gorgeous</i> red hair. The boy was wearing a white shirt with a red hat, and kept bothering his mother to let him go play with his friends.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The second shop was a glassblower’s stall. An old crone wearing a brown shawl was there selling glass containers of various colors, shapes, and sizes. I remember Link being incredibly excited at this for some reason, but I didn’t understand why. When he tried to offer his entire wallet for a single stoppered bottle, I had to drag him away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The third stall had a Goron selling rocks. He was wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, and was smoking out of a pipe. Whatever was in the pipe, it produced a thick, dark purple cloud that hung around him in a hazy fog. I got closer to inspect the rocks. They were kind of shiny and translucent, but they were just normal rocks as far as I could tell. I asked him how much they cost, and he said the cheapest was four hundred and twenty rupees. I told him that was way too much, but he just shrugged. Then I remembered my kingdom needed aid, so I asked if he could take a message back to his people for me. He said “Don’t look at me, I’m just a farmer.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The last shop was run by a man who wore bright purple robes, and who I can only describe as possibly the <i>happiest</i> man alive. He was just so cheerful, with everything he said and did. It was a bit unnerving. He claimed to be a wealthy merchant and a collector of exotic goods, but his shelves were bare save for a single mask of a woman wearing thick makeup with vines tangled in her hair. Oddly, every time I blinked or looked away for even a moment, he was standing somewhere else and in a different pose.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>14th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>In my dream, I awoke at the center of an ornate circle drawn in the dirt, under an open sky in a grassy field. To my shock I was surrounded by Blin, but they did not seem to notice me. A tall, scrawny one wearing robes sat meditating a few feet away from me. The others followed his lead, repeating his chants. I tried writing it down, but I wasn’t able to make sense of anything they said.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>16th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I dreamt that I went to speak with the Goddesses, then came crashing down from the heavens to land back at the Temple of Time. In my descent, I broke through the roof and several floors, coming to rest at the dais where Niesis was kept in stasis.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I stood and looked around at the people gathered there. Several monks, some common townsfolk, and a few women that looked not unlike Niesis. At first I thought they were awestruck at my majestic grace, but then I realized I was naked. I tried to cover myself, but it didn’t help. They just wouldn’t stop gawking at my ass and bare tits. Eventually Sage Amaurath came to my aid, tossing me a set of scholar’s robes. I quickly donned them, only for him to usher me aside and chastise me for being late to my studies on Old Magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>18th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I was on a fishing boat somewhere on the river. It was raining pretty hard, but no one seemed to mind. We were anchored, and the men were out on deck fishing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I went to each of them in turn trying to ask where we were and when we were heading back. None of them would answer me. I tried to get a look at one of their faces, but when he turned, his flesh was rotten and crawling with worms. I jerked back in a panic, and his corpse fell into the river. As did the other men, one by one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Around me, the river turned to blood and the boat began to sink.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>20th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I was sitting at the campfire with Link, after he got back from saving Burdah from the kodongo. Everything was the same as it was, except…</span>
<br><br>
<span>In my dream, I caught him eyeing me, and it kind of turned me on. I flirted with him a bit, teasing him mercilessly at every opportunity. It was fun, but I felt guilty for leading him on like that. I never expected it would actually go anywhere—I was just trying to get him to open up to me.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But then he got closer. Intimately close. He placed his hand on my bare skin, and said some of the nicest, sweetest things anyone has ever said to me. I can’t for the life of me recall what he actually said, but I vividly remember how it felt, and being struck by his passion and eloquence. (Link! Eloquent? Hah.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had me so hot and wet, I practically threw myself at him in front of the whole camp and dragged him back to my tent. I’ve never been with a man, and thinking about the dream now makes me feel queasy. Even so, some part of me wishes it wasn’t just a dream. If only I never had to deal with the consequences of my actions…</span>
<br><br>
<span>I suppose when I inevitably have to choose a consort, I could do worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>22nd of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I was walking through a heavily wooded area in the middle of the afternoon. The dense canopy overhead blocked out much of the sun and sky, though a ray of light still shone through here and there. After walking for some time, I arrived at a clearing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was a young man there huddled around a campfire. He was wearing a tall, tattered brown hat, with clothes to match. And he was carving an instrument. Some kind of flute? I don’t recall exactly—I didn’t get a good look. Cautiously, I greeted him, asking what he was doing out here all alone. He stopped what he was doing to look up at me, but didn’t answer. His features didn’t stand out, but I do remember he had these <i>dark rings</i> around his eyes, and I spotted a shining piece of gold hanging around his neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He seemed surprised to see me. Anxious? Afraid, even. I tried to approach, but he started shaking violently and I backed off. I tried soothing him, but it did nothing. I tried asking a few other questions. What was his name? Was he lost? Did he need help? He didn’t answer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just when I was about to leave, he put the flute to his lips and blew. A single grassy note echoed through the clearing. When he stopped, I heard rustling in the trees and brush all around me, but didn’t see anything. I then heard him laugh, but when I turned around he was gone. In his place, only leaves in the wind.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Full of nervous energy, Zelda wrung her hands as she sat waiting for Laylith to finish. To her relief, Laylith handed the journal back when she was done without so much as a chortle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A few of them sounded rather ominous. And I can’t imagine how stressful having these dreams is for you. You’d have a hard time convincing me the ones involving lakes and rivers didn’t refer to Ja’bu and the Zora in some capacity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s because they <i>do</i>,” Zelda said emphatically. “I’m certain of it. When Olvas told me of the news—it’s hard to describe. But I just <i>knew</i>, from the first moment, that those events were exactly what the dreams were referencing. Well, mostly…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘Mostly?’ That doesn’t sound like certainty to me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There are some details I’m still not sure of,” Zelda said, waving her hand from side to side. “The first one involved my parents. Why were they there? Is that detail relevant? Were they trying to tell me something? Or was it just random connections my mind made in response to the substance of the dream?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Layith looked to be considering. Zelda took the opportunity to flip to an open page and jot down her thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you considered thinking about it more metaphorically?” Laylith asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shrugged. “Sure, but I’m not certain what their presence represents. My lineage? The Royal Family?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hard to say,” Laylith murmured. “Do you remember anything specific they said?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said with a sigh. “It’s often difficult for me to remember details like…” Wait. Now that she thought about it, there <i>was</i> something Mother said. What was it? “Hold on, it’s coming back to me.” She held up a hand, closing her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘I think we’re lost,’ Mother said. She wanted to turn back. Father told her… he said that he had ridden the trail many times, and that we’d be back before nightfall. Huh.” It was funny how clearly she remembered it now, given the detail had completely eluded her mere moments ago.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith nodded along. “That does sound like an important detail. Hmm…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scribbled a note next to the original journal entry.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So you were trapped in a carriage with the corpses of your mother and father,” Laylith said, musing. “Maybe that’s it? Maybe the dream is warning you not to follow in the tradition of your predecessors.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly. She could see the sense of that. “Sounds like a reasonable interpretation,” she said. “Although—I’m not aware of any accounts in recent history where our kingdom dealt directly with the Zora. That might be a stretch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who knows?” Laylith said. “Something to consider at least.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm…” Zelda muttered absentmindedly as she read back over the other entries. “Being trapped, that does seem to be a consistent theme here,” she wondered aloud. “In the carriage, against the cliffside, on a sinking boat… fleeing from a rising tide doesn’t exactly fit that pattern, but it’s close.” She sighed, rubbing her temples. There were so many ways she could interpret that, she wasn’t sure where to begin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why don’t we move on for now?” Laylith offered. “Take a moment and clear your mind. It won’t do you any good to fret about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re probably right,” Zelda said. She closed her journal and took a deep breath, relaxing into her chair. “Have any thoughts on the others?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At first blush, no,” Laylith said with a frown. “Although they do seem to be in an entirely different category. The water-related ones were obviously portentous. But fleeing from an unknown danger? Random daily tasks? Sexual fantasies?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I wouldn’t exactly call them <i>fantasies</i>,” Zelda interjected. Laylith eyed her suspiciously, but made no comment. Zelda felt her face flush.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not an expert by any means,” Laylith said, thankfully moving on from the subject. “But those types of dreams <i>are</i> common. To be clear, I’m absolutely not ruling out there being some hidden meaning behind them, given your circumstances. I only mean to say it would surprise me more to learn they were prophetic in some way, as opposed to just being ordinary dreams.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A point well made,” Zelda said. “And yes, I’m aware. But I’m also hesitant to throw away any minor detail. Even if it doesn’t make sense to me now, or seems absurd—it could be important, you know? Like that golden fragment around the young man’s neck in the woods—it’s hard not to read into that.” Laylith nodded, seeming to understand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith shifted in her seat, crossing her arms and resting her chin on one hand. Zelda studied her, intrigued. “What is it?” she asked. Laylith only shook her head. “Oh, come on! You can’t <i>not</i> tell me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith sighed, giving in. “Keep in mind, this is just a suggestion,” she said, couching her words. “And I do <i>not</i> want you to go out on your own. Ever.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded swiftly. “Wouldn’t think of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith eyed her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, seriously,” Zelda said sternly. “That wasn’t sarcasm. It’s very sound advice. I’m not about to get eaten by tektites.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith puzzled at that, but waved it off. “Actually, I’d rather not know,” she said. “Anyway. I was thinking perhaps you could try and seek out similar locations to your dreams? Try and meditate on their meaning in locations that remind you strongly of them. Maybe something interesting might come of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Zelda said, reopening her journal and jotting a note to herself. “Sounds sensible. Any other thoughts?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith shrugged. “Other than revisiting them from time to time? Maybe list out all the random details, see if you can categorize them or if any patterns emerge. I’d be happy to help with that if you’d like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Also sensible,” Zelda said, already scanning back over her notes. “Yeah… I’ll be sure to do that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And I know this is hard—” Laylith said, leaning forward and placing a hand over Zelda’s current page. Zelda looked up, feeling vaguely offended at the nigh-heretical act. “—but try not to stress so much about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Laylith, I can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know it’s important,” she said. “But you can’t let it eat at you. That’s decidedly counterproductive. Think of it this way: can you study well when you’re stressed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda grumbled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then what makes you think you’re more capable of saving the world when you’re stressed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Damnation,</i> but she had a point.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I understand you, I do,” Zelda said, snapping her journal shut and stowing away her quill. “But to be frank? I don’t know how to <i>not</i> stress over it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gasped as Laylith embraced her in a tight, firm hug. She tensed at first, but relaxed into it, feeling some of the stress leave her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re not alone in this,” Laylith said, patting her gently on the shoulder. “You would do well to remember that. I’m always here if you need me. Just ask.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” was all Zelda could manage. “Thank you,” she added, failing to think of anything else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was going to take some getting used to.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>It was about half an hour past sundown, and most of the camp was quieting down for the night. Link, however, was restless.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He knew he would do well to get some sleep, but he also knew there was little chance of that happening with his mind as busy as it was. He had taken some time earlier to catch up with Zelda, and was filled in from her discussion with Naibi. He learned of the recent history of the Gerudo, and more about their enemy: Ganondorf, the Exiled King.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ganondorf. <i>Ganondorf.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned the name over and over in his mind. He normally wasn’t one to judge—particularly where other cultures were concerned—but he found himself wondering about the mental health of parents who would name their child <i>Ganondorf</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Resigned, Link sat up from his bedroll, strapped on his boots, and donned his cloak. For all he had learned from Zelda, he only had more questions. If he was going to get any sleep tonight, he’d have to do something about that. He slipped out of his tent and made for Naibi’s encampment atop the small knoll at the southern edge of camp.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Hey, Naibi! Have a moment?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…No, too casual. He hadn’t actually met her personally. </span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Excuse me, Your Eminence?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…Too formal. She wouldn’t like that. </span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Naibi, I have some questions for you.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…Too direct.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link was at her tent before he realized it, and came to an abrupt halt. Naibi was sitting over a small campfire tending to her equipment as a large chunk of meat roasted on a spit. She stopped and looked up at him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His mind went blank.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Come. Sit,” she said, gesturing to the side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, okay,” he said. Inwardly, he cursed at himself for botching it so badly. He awkwardly shuffled around the campfire and took a seat at what he hoped was a respectful and appropriate distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi set aside her arrow and whetstone, took out a dagger, and carved out a piece of meat. “Hungry?” She slid the meat onto a skewer, passing it his way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wasn’t particularly hungry, but it smelled way too nice to pass up. “Thanks,” he said, graciously accepting the offering. His mouth watered as he took in the delightful scents of char, but he waited until she had her portion ready before digging in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm. ’s really good,” he said between mouthfuls. “Jackalbadger?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi nodded. It was rich and soft, with a hint of spice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” she asked after a moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, right,” Link said, tossing a bone into the fire. “I, uh, had some questions for you. If that’s alright?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She tisked. “A shame. Does this mean tying you up in my tent is out of the question?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link choked. What was <i>with</i> this woman?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Kidding, kidding,” Naibi said with a laugh. “You are hardly my type.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link set aside his skewer, poking one end into the ground. “I’m going to be honest with you,” he said frankly, wiping his mouth clean. “I have no idea how I’m supposed to respond to that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi shrugged. “We will stick to business then. I assume Zelda sent you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err… no,” Link said, scratching his head. What gave her that impression?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then I am confused,” Naibi said sharply, her voice rising. “What business does Zelda’s champion have with me at this hour?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked her over, seriously reconsidering his decision to come here. He was in <i>way</i> over his head with this one. He had seen her talk circles around people far more savvy than he. There was no telling what kind of mess he could get himself into if he wasn’t careful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was too late to turn back now, though. He needed answers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can we start over?” he tried. He wiped his hand on his cloak, extending it to her. “Hi, I’m Link.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi balked at first, but he kept his hand extended. Eventually, she leaned over and shook it. “…Hello, Link,” she said warily. “I am Naibi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now that we’re properly introduced,” he said, as amicably as he could manage, “mind if I ask you some questions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi folded her arms and stared him down. Link felt a bead of sweat drip down his forehead, but he held her gaze and tried to smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” she said, taking a bite of meat, arms still crossed. “Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link let out a sigh of relief and—was he imagining it, or did she just laugh at him?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I was hoping you could tell me more about Ganondorf?” he said, opting to jump straight into it. “We don’t actually have that much intel on him. Any information at all could prove useful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure. What do you want to know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh…” He was really regretting not having composed specific questions ahead of time. “How about the size of his forces?” That seemed like a good place to start.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“His forces?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“When he was forced into exile?” Link asked hesitantly. “What size of an army did he take with him?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“None, as far as I am aware.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>What.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head in disbelief. “Wait, no—what? Seriously? You’re telling me he conquered the Blin all by himself?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That seems to be the case, yes. Well—” she gestured with one hand “—there were a few fanatics who followed him. But no army.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Wow.</i> That revelation had him floored. How could anyone manage such a feat?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What can I say? A truer Gerudo king there never was,” Naibi said, seeming to read his mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But—I thought he was evil?” Link said. “A power-hungry tyrant?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Eh,” Naibi said with a casual shrug. “Not always. He was once a great leader. Strong. Charming. Charismatic. There was a reason he was hailed as a king among kings.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link boggled at that. He found it difficult to imagine a strong, charming, charismatic leader allying himself with the forces of darkness, being driven into exile from his kingdom, conquering the Blin single-handedly, and then ushering in a Blight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi picked her teeth clean and tossed her skewer into the fire. “Did you have any other questions?” she asked impatiently. “It is growing late.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, sorry,” Link said, rubbing his at neck and looking down at his feet. He needed to get better about that. “Just one more and I’ll leave you be. I had a dream after I underwent the Lightsworn ritual—you heard about that, right?” Naibi nodded. “—Right. So when I was out, I had this dream. A vision, really. I saw a bunch of locations I had never even heard of before. One of them was a great obsidian spire hidden away somewhere in the mountains, and there was this winding path to it that was obscured by a sandstorm in the desert. I don’t suppose you know where that is?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Naibi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” she said. “I do not. And it is getting late. You should leave.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Master—</i> Link jumped to his feet as he heard Fi’s voice echo in his mind. <i>—I believe Naibi is lying to you.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it?!” Naibi said, drawing her dagger in anticipation. “Where?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, uh—I thought I saw a ropa,” Link lied. “Just a rock. False alarm. Heheh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There are no ropas this far north,” Naibi said skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, thanks. Good to know,” Link said, trying not to give anything away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi brandished her dagger in his general direction. “Get going before I reconsider tying you up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks for your time!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link jerked awake with a muted cry. A few ragged, gasping breaths escaped his chest as sweat dripped from his brow. He peeled his back off the damp bedroll before reaching for his waterskin. Uncorking it, he gulped down a few mouthfuls, then splashed some on his face and neck. The cool nighttime air sent chills down his spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This time, it was about the family trapped in the burning barn from a few years back. He hadn’t had that one in a while. Remmi had run in to try and save them while Link and the others fought off the raiders. But by the time they were routed, it was too late—he found Remmi collapsed on the ground, suffocating from the smoke. The look of terror in her eyes as her life slowly faded away… her violent wheezing as she tried desperately to clear her lungs…</span>
<br><br>
<span>That memory stuck with him more than anything from the battle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You okay over there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned to see Izu sitting up in his own bedroll across the tent. “Yeah, sorry,” Link said quickly, feeling embarrassed. “Didn’t mean to wake you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Eh,” Izu said, waving a hand. “Not a problem. I get enough sleep on the job anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link blinked. What?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A joke,” Izu clarified. “But real talk: I swear my old captain actually slept standing on his feet. Didn’t move a muscle until there was trouble to deal with, then probably nodded off again right after.” He shifted, propping himself up against his knee. “I never did find out what happened to him. Off with Wymar on the front, I suppose. Either that, or snoozing on a ranch somewhere, hacking Bokoblins to bits in his sleep.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh. That was a joke too, wasn’t it? Link’s mind was still half-asleep.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anyway, don’t worry about it,” Izu said. “I’ve had my fair share of nightmares. I know what it’s like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shifted uncomfortably. Thus far, he’d gone to great lengths to avoid talking about his own nightmares. It wasn’t exactly a topic he was keen to discuss. Still, the opportunity was here, and he trusted Izu. He wouldn’t get a better chance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, uh. Do you have any advice?” he asked lamely. Link held out hope that Izu of all people could help. He always seemed relaxed and generally laid back. Surely if he had nightmares too… surely he had found some way of dealing with them?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Izu answered confidently. “Stop dwelling on past mistakes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned his head. “Easy for you to say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it really isn’t,” the Captain of the Royal Guard said sternly. Link had to remind himself who he was speaking to. A familiar silence settled between them; the grim silence of men who had seen the worst service life had to offer, and who had lived to tell about it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu grunted. “You wanted my advice? That’s it. Move on. Learn to live with yourself. Agonizing over your past sins won’t help you—and by the Mother, it’s not going to help them. When you wake up each morning, focus on that day, and only on that day. Focus on being there with those who matter most to you. On those who are still alive. On those you can still make a difference to. What do they need from you? Who do they need you to be? Figure it out. Get it into a routine. Make it your creed. Live by it. When you can do that, and do it well, then you can move on to thinking about the next day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sat still, stunned and feeling somewhat reverent. He recognized real wisdom when he heard it, and right now it was time to shut up and listen. It didn’t make the most sense to him in the moment, but—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At least, that’s how it went for me,” Izu said after a moment’s pause. He rolled over onto his back. “It’s different for everyone, I suppose. You’ll probably have to figure out what works for you and what doesn’t. Do some soul searching. Pick up an art. Mediate in the mountains. Go fishing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fishing,” Link repeated, feeling intensely skeptical.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu sat back up with a stifled groan. “Link. Look, I’m not your captain anymore, and it’s probably not my place. But you want another piece of advice?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked back over to him. The captain was in shadow, but if he looked closely he could just barely make out the glint of a few silver hairs in the moonlight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. Please.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well,” Izu said, scratching the unshaven stubble on his chin. “There’s something else. It’s not <i>exactly</i> related, and I don’t know if it’ll help with your sleep. Knowing you, it’ll probably keep you up all night. But it’s something you need to accept, and I think it’s best you heard it sooner rather than later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And that is?” Link didn’t like where this was going. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“You aren’t a soldier. Not anymore.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. “What? Of course I am. I—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu held up a hand. “Now, hold on. Let me finish,” he said. “Officially, the only person you report to is the queen. You’re outside the chain of command. Not even the Lord General has any say in where you go and what you do. Hell, there’s even a case to be made that <i>he’s</i> subordinate to <i>you</i>. At least where the queen and the queen’s safety are concerned. You understand what that means, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link raised an eyebrow, head cocked to the side. What was he getting at?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let me put it this way. All that stuff about vigilant duty? Regulations? Standards?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded along.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s just shit they throw on green boys to build character,” he said empathetically with a slight shake of his head. “Don’t get me wrong—the work needs to be done. But there’s twenty-six capable pairs of hands out there, and any of their time is better spent combing through the brush looking for fiends than is yours.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what if—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—What if someone gets hurt?” Izu finished for him. “Hate to say it, but that’s on them. You can’t be everywhere at all times. Sometimes, it <i>actually is</i> someone else’s responsibility. But your responsibility? It’s directly to the queen and kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So?” Link bit back, feeling indignant. “I know that. But that doesn’t mean I’m not a soldier. The Lord General is still a soldier—his immediate superior just happens to be the Crown. Same as me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, sure,” Izu said. “But does a general set up his own tent, take a turn at digging latrines, or go out scouting the perimeter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Link begrudgingly admitted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And why’s that? Because a general has more important things to do than grunt work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Izu—don’t be ridiculous,” Link said, growing impatient. “I’m not commanding an army, and it’s not like I’m wasting time either. I see jobs that need doing, and I get them done. That’s all there is to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And that’s exactly my point. Or haven’t you been listening?” Izu let the words hang in the air. He sounded angry. Link had <i>never</i> heard him angry. “Link—you don’t have anything to prove. By the Mother, you’re a <i>Lightsworn</i>—the very embodiment of Hylia’s righteous judgement! Your job <i>isn’t</i> to play at being a common sergeant, keeping the camp running and nannying men twenty years your senior. Your job is to save the damned kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked away, suddenly feeling very small and very petty. He’d asked for this, hadn’t he? He’d prayed to Hylia above for the opportunity to do something meaningful, and the power bestowed upon him in answer to his prayers came with an <i>unfathomable</i> responsibility.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry,” Izu said with a yawn. “I know it’s hard to hear, but it’s the truth. I feel right awful dumping that on you—especially considering how this conversation started. Do try and get some sleep though, yeah? Speaking of.” He rolled over, and within moments was snoring soundly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a long sigh, Link flopped back on his bedroll. Izu was right—how was he supposed to get any rest now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>…If only he could Soothe himself to sleep.</span>

<br>
<span>They reached the Sunseeker encampment much earlier than Zelda thought they would. She supposed it helped that they got an early start. It was well-hidden and defensible; tucked away behind a mountain pass that started at the foothills near the edge of a lake. Apparently the pass led all the way around to the highlands further north—which was technically part of Hyrule, but that had not stopped a few settlers from encroaching.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The first thing Zelda noticed was that there were many more males among the Sunseekers than she was expecting. Not quite half—closer to a third, perhaps—but it was a far cry from the stories suggesting a single male king ruled over an entire nation that doubled as his harem. She had to wonder how that legend got started.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The encampment itself wasn’t much to speak of, although judging by the size, it likely housed a few hundred people comfortably. They had made heavy use of the natural terrain, with large stone buildings being built up against the surrounding cliffs. A twenty-foot tall stone wall surrounded the encampment on three sides, with a single heavy wooden portcullis being the only visible entrance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unsurprisingly, Naibi had not permitted her guard entry into the small town—save for Link. Also unsurprisingly, it took a good twenty minutes to assuage their fears. She reasoned that if their hosts meant her harm, not only would this be an absurd way to go about it, but there wasn’t much her small retinue could do about that in the first place. Laylith in particular refused to see reason, but ultimately conceded when Link ordered her to stand down. Zelda wasn’t sure what the fuss was about—usually Laylith was remarkably rational. Zelda could only surmise she was edging for an opportunity not to be left out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were led in past a row of guards carrying spears and glaives, then across a cobbled street through a central market. The people there seemed mostly unconcerned with Zelda’s arrival as they went about their business, though she did catch a few stray glances. At the far end of the street, they followed an alleyway through to a lift, where Naibi bid them to continue alone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She is expecting you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was it. Zelda and Link stepped off the lift to stand at the entrance to a short natural tunnel that led out to a cliff overlooking the encampment. At the other side, a tall woman with light tan skin, short red hair, and unfamiliar clothing stood alone, looking out into the distance. The Lynx.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At her side, Link turned to her. “Ready?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda half-whispered. “But does it matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded to him, and on they went.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As they neared, Zelda noticed the woman was far taller than she had pictured her being—almost as tall as Grenja. And her ears… so short. And rounded? Strange.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Idly she wondered: how does one address a person known only as <i>the Lynx</i>? Zelda settled for a simple “Hello.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The response she got back was not what she was expecting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why are you here?” the Lynx asked simply, not even bothering to turn around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started. She and Link exchanged glances.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Because you ficking asked us here, promised us your aid, went so far as to order your lieutenant to arrange a meeting by any means necessary, and have intimated you know more about our common enemy than any sane person would believe possible?</i>, Zelda wanted to say. She chose instead to take the question seriously, at face value.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because our kingdom—and the entire realm—is beset by an enemy more dangerous and capable than any it has ever faced. We have been led to believe that you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ganondorf is not the enemy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I’m sorry, what?” Zelda tried to be patient and tactful, but her patience was wearing thin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lynx turned about, and Zelda saw her face for the first time. She had soft features, with wide, slightly slanted eyes. Light grey eyes; the color of a stormy sky. Zelda’s heart skipped a beat, and she had to push down the butterflies in her stomach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda: listen to me carefully,” she said. Her tone was calm, but carried with it a tension just beneath the surface. “Our time is sharply limited. Every moment that passes, the enemy gains. And he is already, so. Far. Ahead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The manner in which she said those last words made Zelda’s skin crawl. One did not talk that way about mortal armies and exiled kings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If Ganondorf is not the enemy, the power behind him then,” Zelda said. “What is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The same force that killed your Mother Goddess ages ago.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>My</i> Mother Goddess? Hylia was the mother of all Creation. The first child of the Golden Three. The inheritor of their combined power.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Who in damnation was this woman?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But Hylia wasn’t killed ages ago,” Link said. “She—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The entity that empowered Zelda and possessed her body to turn back the Blin horde was <i>not</i> Hylia. It was merely a shadow. A husk. A remnant. The shape of the void left behind by the passing of something far greater.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A Fae?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” the Lynx said. “They are related, but not the same.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And how do you know any of this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you doubt me?” she asked. “Ask your construct. I speak the truth.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Construct?</i> Did she mean… Fi?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, Master,” Fi said, her chromatic form materializing a couple paces ahead and to the side. “I can confirm; I do not detect any attempt at deception. I conclude that she believes what she says with relative certainty.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda closed her eyes and took a calming breath. She—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I am to proceed,” the Lynx said, interrupting Zelda’s train of thought, “then I need to know you are worth my time. You believe the world is ending, and as far as I can tell, the most impactful thing you have done is bumble your way into disrupting a binding ritual you knew nothing about, thus releasing Fae back into the world and destroying an ancient artifact in the process.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So I ask you again: <i>why are you here</i>? What do you hope to gain, and how can I trust that you’re not stupid enough to take anything I give you, trip over a rock, and burn down the other half of your kingdom?”</span>
