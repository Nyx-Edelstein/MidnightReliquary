<span>The assassins advanced.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No,</i> Xayla thought, panic rising.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her last remaining guardsman was injured, and she had exhausted her magic completely. They were hopelessly outmatched.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Avalia—Goddess Above! Please, don’t let it end like this!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s world exploded in a flash of prismatic light. Her awareness expanded a thousand-fold. Fear and fatigue faded to nothing, and she felt her magic restored—raw, pure energy now <i>surging</i> within her, filling her to the brink and <i>yearning</i> to be unleashed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She reached out, moving as if guided by an unseen hand. Her fingers spread wide, channeling the surging energy within. A breath. A thought. She snapped her fingers, and hundreds of razor-sharp ice spines erupted from the ground, impaling the assassins where they stood. The crystalline shards shattered an instant later, and mangled bodies collapsed into a spreading pool of crimson.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And just like that, it was over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Astoundingly, she felt no drain on her reserves. This rushing power was <i>limitless</i>. And with childlike fascination, she marveled as her skin glowed with a golden aura.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her guardsman fell to his knees beside her. “O Avalia!” he cried in reverence. “Holy Mother!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla tried to maintain her composure, but failed. She laughed, wiping tears from her eyes. How absurd! Her prayer had been answered—literally—and now this? Surely he couldn’t actually think—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Xayla,” a gentle voice spoke from behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Eep!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla jumped and spun around, her hand flying to her chest. A feminine form floated before her—radiant, ethereal, divine. The figure wore a billowing cloak that seemed to drift on unseen currents. Xayla gasped and dropped to her knees.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Interesting,” the floating figure said. She had no arms that Xayla could see, yet somehow conveyed the <i>very idea</i> of touching her chin in thought. “Analysis indicates I triggered an acute fear response. I apologize—I’m still calibrating appropriate manifestation protocols for local species interaction. I will adjust future approaches accordingly.” Now that Xayla was paying attention, she realized the specter’s mouth didn’t move when she spoke either. The words simply <i>echoed</i> in her mind with crystalline clarity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hesitated. “Are you… Avalia?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, I see the problem now,” the ethereal entity replied. “Allow me to clarify: I am φ<sub>∅</sub>, designated emissary to Her Grace, the Goddess Avalia.” She spun midair in what seemed like an experimental pirouette. “Her Grace has tasked me with providing analytical guidance and assistance for your quest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stared at her in confusion. Was that a name? She had heard… something. But when she tried to form the sounds with her mouth, nothing came. It was as if the concept existed only in her mind, untranslatable to speech.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You may simply call me ‘Null,’” the specter offered helpfully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My… quest?” Xayla asked slowly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative. Your quest. Please, do not be alarmed at the next event.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace!” the guardsman yelled, rising and taking off at a sprint.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rose to her feet, bewildered. <i>What was even happening anymore?</i> “And what is my quest, exactly?” she asked, voice trembling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have a message from Her Grace. Please listen carefully.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded hesitantly. Null drew herself tall, tilting her head toward the heavens and spreading wide what would have been her arms—except that she had none. She pulsed with light, and a new voice echoed in Xayla’s mind—gentle and motherly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla, my child,” the voice said. “Your people are fighting and dying as we speak. Rally the armies waiting for you in the courtyard, then make your way to the northwest gate. There you will find a soldier who needs your aid—you will know him when you see him. Use my blessing and bring the fight to the enemy. I have done all I can; the rest I entrust to you. Heed Null’s counsel, for she will guide you. Do you accept this charge?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace!” Xayla cried, falling to her knees.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null settled into what seemed like a more relaxed posture. Xayla looked to her expectantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The tactical situation appears time-critical,” Null said. “Analysis suggests immediate action would be optimal. I recommend we proceed without delay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rose to her feet, shaking her head in exasperation. “Fine! What do you recommend, Null?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Analyzing optimal route…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? But you just said we don’t have—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—A ballistic trajectory offers the most efficient approach. Vector: five-point-zero-three radians azimuth, zero-point-nine-two radians elevation from your current position, distance approximately forty-eight meters—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Null, stop!” Xayla said, waving her hands. “I can’t…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She couldn’t <i>what</i>? She spun around, looking up and to her left.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A window.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Experimentally, Xayla drew on her Green affinity, gathering up all the magic she could muster and forcing it into an updraft of air. A gale-force wind whipped through her clothes and hair, but she remained firmly planted on the ground. She tried again—this time while jumping and leaning forward—but only managed to go careening off to the side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Alright, that wasn’t going to work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Update: Analysis indicates your current aerodynamic configuration is insufficient for sustained flight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Null! I am well aware.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. She was overthinking this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned back to the window and let loose a gust of wind. The glass shattered easily, leaving her plenty of room to maneuver. Carefully—her Blue magic was <i>much</i> stronger than her Green—she summoned a tide of water beneath her feet at an upward angle. It lifted her smoothly into the air, and she let herself splash back down into another waiting surge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It worked! She was soaked through now, but that didn’t matter—it would fade soon enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Recalibrating approach to account—” Xayla tried interrupting Null with a splash of water, but it only phased through her. The specter continued without pause. “—for variables previously excluded to simplify initial model. Time efficiency suggests adopting a more conventional—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null!” Xayla screamed in exasperation. “Do you <i>ever</i> stop talking?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m detecting elevated stress indicators. Would you prefer I remain silent and allow you to proceed independently?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. <i>Please</i>,” Xayla said, exasperated. She took a breath to compose herself. “I can handle this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She eyed the window, judging the angle. Taking a breath, she steadied herself. One… two…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A surge of water propelled her up and out. She held her breath as the window rushed toward her—faster than anticipated. The thrill was exhilarating! But now she was heading straight for a stone wall. Scrambling, she summoned a surge to dampen her momentum and another to redirect herself. However, a jet of water shot up her nose, throwing off her concentration completely. She went careening off course and tumbled headfirst over the roof.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Owww.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rose to her feet and wiped the dirt from her face. Well, that had been extremely careless—but no matter. With Avalia’s blessing, she seemed wholly uninjured. She stretched and flexed experimentally. One final surge, more carefully aimed this time, propelled her the rest of the distance. With a gentle splash, she landed neatly within the staging grounds before an assemblage of soldiers awaiting her arrival.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except she was still sopping wet. And they had presumed—quite reasonably—that she would be arriving from the castle rather than dropping in from the sky. How embarrassing! She really should have thought this through. Gasps and cries of shock rang out through the crowds as she hastily wrung the worst of it from her hair and clothing. What a sight she must have been!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar dashed through the crowds to her side, eyes wide with concern. “Princess! Are you alright?” He stopped abruptly as he drew near, gaping in awe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla smiled, trying to project confidence she didn’t quite feel. “Wymar! Perfect timing. I have news: Avalia herself has chosen me as her champion and commanded me to rally our forces. We’re taking the fight to the enemy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar only stammered incoherently.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know—I’m still coming to grips with it myself.” Xayla rubbed her palms together and bit at her lip. “Listen, could you handle rallying the troops for me? There’s something else I need to do first.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla surged through the air, zipping past soldiers in hasty retreat. More than a few stopped to gawk, but she paid them no mind. She had work to do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She came to a stop on the roof of a building as she drew near to the gate. She was wholly unprepared for what she saw: carnage; raw, and unbridled. The stench was unbearable. Bodies lay strewn throughout the streets—Blin and Avalian alike. Nowhere could she look without seeing dismembered corpses and entrails.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sight should have made her sick, but she was beyond that now. What she felt instead was <i>hate</i>—pure, burning hatred for the vile creatures that had brought this blight upon her realm. Upon her <i>home</i>. She would not forget this. She could never forget this, and neither would they. They would pay dearly for what they had done.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This would be the Blight to end all Blights. She would see to that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, a throng of the wretches had gathered in a large circle, chanting and cheering in a frenzy. Xayla observed them from afar with disgust. How dare they celebrate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her eyes locked onto a lone soldier in the center of the mob, facing down two lumbering giants. The bodies of at least three other soldiers and several Blin lay scattered at his feet. Was this the one she was meant to save?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man ducked under a swing from one of the brutes and rammed his sword into the skull of the other. His sword caught as he tried to pull it free, and he staggered back—but too late. The one left standing tackled him to the ground, and began savagely ripping at his chest with claws and teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla launched herself from the roof in a frenzy. Avalia’s divine radiance resonated with her wrath, <i>demanding</i> to be unleashed. She obliged, hurling dense balls of rolling flame into the throng. Their cheers turned to howls of pain as bodies were engulfed. Dozens fell screaming, blackened and charred corpses piling up. She did not relent. Xayla surged over the mass, raining death from above. She landed at the far end to cut off their escape, then drew on every last ounce of magic in her blood to send continuous streams of jagged ice flying in all directions. She was a goddess of hail, blood, death, fire, and <i>vengeance</i>. Her whole body shook with strain, and everything that moved, died.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Exhausted from the effort, she fell to her knees. Even with Avalia’s boon, it seemed she had limits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was she too late? Who was this man that Avalia had sent her specifically to aid? She scanned the mass of bodies, searching for where she’d last seen him. There! His attacker had collapsed on top of him. Xayla rushed over and tried to heave the body aside, but couldn’t manage it. She resorted to magic instead—a carefully aimed surge did the trick.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man sputtered, coughing up blood. His tunic was torn to shreds and soaked through. She wasted no time, tearing away his tattered clothing and drawing on her magic. Green energies swirled in her hands and she pressed them to his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man’s eyes found hers and he reached out with a weak grasp. “Av… Avalia,” he struggled to say, “Why… why have you forsaken… agghh!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No! Xayla drew back as the man convulsed, his pained moans breaking into ragged gasps. She watched in horror as the gashes across his chest tore themselves open again, dark blood seeping through the newly-closed wounds. This couldn’t be happening! Why would Avalia send her here if she couldn’t save him?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null’s voice echoed in her mind. Xayla nearly jumped out of her skin in surprise, not expecting to find the specter floating at her side. “I have information that may help. The wound appears to be—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For the love of the Mother, Null! Just tell me how I can save him!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The affliction is spiritual in nature—what you call ‘bloodrage.’ Your healing magic can purge such corruption, but will require sustained application at much higher intensity than normal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla gawked at her. “Seriously?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative. I estimate a ninety-nine-point-seven percent chance he will still require extensive medical care, but in your current state you should have more than sufficient magic to prevent his death.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned back to the man, muttering a curse under her breath. She scrambled to gather up her magic again, but he writhed beneath her hands, batting them away. His anguished cries tore at her heart, but she could not fail the goddess now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen to me, you damned fool!” she said through her tears, struggling in vain to hold him still. “I don’t know who you are, but Avalia herself sent me here to save you! Now hold still—<i>urgh!</i>” It was no use; his mind was too far gone. He wouldn’t listen, and she lacked the strength to restrain him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She gave up in favor of another strategy—one of the lesser-used Green magics. Would this work? She didn’t know, but she had to try. Xayla pulled back, resting on her knees in front of the man. She steadied her breathing and closed her eyes. Her heart pounded in her chest. Her nerves were frayed. This would only work if she could find peace within herself. She tried in vain to shut out his cries and the horrible smells around her, but it was too much. She was too present in the moment, and the sensations were too overwhelming. She needed to focus inward… needed to find something…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Her earliest memory: Nira playing a flute to lull her to sleep. The warmth and safety of Father’s arms as he read to her. Sage Amaran beaming with pride when she shared her first discovery.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She lost herself in the memories, letting them fill her mind. With those feelings as her anchor, she radiated pulses of Soothing energy outward. The man’s cries quieted, and he fell still. Xayla wasted no time. Green motes sparked and swirled around her hands as she pressed them to his chest. Seconds passed. The wounds began to knit together—but just as she expected, he started to writhe and moan as the mended flesh tore itself apart again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shhhh,” she whispered, alternating between mending and soothing. “It’s going to be okay. Just listen to my voice.” She sang softly, pouring everything she had into the Healing. His struggles ceased, and she pressed on. The gashes across his chest pulsed with each heartbeat, Green energies spiraling between the ragged edges. Minutes dragged by, but with every beat the wounds drew closer together, knitting slowly until at last the flesh was whole.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla slumped backward, tears streaming down her face. The world grew dim, and darkness claimed her.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla woke in her own bed with no sense of how much time had passed. Every breath sent sharp pain through her ribs. Every movement was agony. Her head throbbed and her throat felt dry as dust. She tried to sit up, but a firm hand pressed her back down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Easy now,” a gentle voice said. “Slowly. Don’t push yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla tried to relax, but her side <i>really</i> hurt. Everything felt hazy—sights and sounds bleeding together until she couldn’t quite focus. A cool washcloth pressed against her face, and then a flask touched her lips. She drank deeply. The water was wonderfully refreshing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Slowly. Easy does it. There’s no rush.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla eased back and drifted into a fitful sleep.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>She woke again sometime later. Her headache wasn’t as bad, but her side was still every bit as tender. The nurse from before sat across from her, knitting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How long was I…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“About three days, dearie.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Three days?!</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse offered her a flask, and Xayla drank gratefully. Slowly, the fog in her mind began to clear. “There was a battle,” she said, though she couldn’t remember much else. “What happened?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’ve cracked a few ribs, dear, and you’re suffering from acute magical exhaustion,” the nurse said. “The worst has passed, but your spirit needs time to recover. You’ll need to take it easy for a while—a month or so, by my reckoning—or you risk feedback and degradation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded. She understood the dangers all too well. Affinity was like a fulcrum—it let you use your magic with much greater force, but the strain on your spirit increased proportionally. That’s why she’d always been prone to overdoing it. If she pushed herself too hard now while recovering, she risked permanent damage to her magical abilities.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But that wasn’t what she needed to know. “The battle,” Xayla said. “What happened after I collapsed at the gate?” She stared at her hands—no trace of golden light remained. Had it been real? Fragments of memory surfaced, hazy and uncertain. They felt… wrong. Distant. Like something she’d dreamed rather than lived.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not certain, dear—I wasn’t there myself,” the nurse said. “But from what I’ve heard, you came down from the heavens like Avalia reborn! They say you flew across the battlefield with the army at your back, raining down death upon the hordes until the goddess’s power left you and you fell from the sky.” She shook her head with a small smile. “Quite the tale, if you ask me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That wasn’t quite how it happened, but the words stirred her memory and brought back fragments of what she’d done. “Is it over, then?” Xayla asked. “Have we won?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse scoffed. “Depends on what you mean by ’won.’ The hordes have pulled back and the city’s no longer under siege, if that’s what you’re asking.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She didn’t like the sound of that. “Null?” Xayla called out softly, glancing around the room. “Are you there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse set aside her knitting and came to Xayla’s side, pressing a gentle hand to her cheek. “How are you feeling, dear?” she asked, concern evident in her voice. “You should rest more if you can. It’ll do you good.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I’m fine,” Xayla said, waving her away. “Or I will be, I’m sure. Thank you.” She would rest later. Right now, she needed answers. With care, she eased up, resting against her pillows. “Ah, how terribly rude of me,” she said, smiling. “I never properly thanked you for your service. What was your name again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nilda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Nilda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww—it’s my pleasure to serve, Your Grace,” Nilda said with a smile. “I will be glad to see you on your way back to good health.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla furrowed her brow. “Nilda, do you know where Nira is? Has she been by?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla frowned. “What about the Lord General, then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nilda smiled and shook her head. “I think it’s best you get some rest, dear. No visitors just yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pang of paranoia struck her. What had transpired while she slept? Had Nira made it back safely? And there was no telling what the Council had gotten up to in her absence—she’d never had time to resolve the matter of succession.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nilda?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, dear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid I don’t have the patience for this right now. Please go and send for the Lord General—and don’t say another word to me unless you want my guard to throw you out the window.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nilda’s eyes went wide. Without another word, she turned and hurried from the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The poor woman didn’t deserve that. Xayla sighed and shook her head. But she had more important matters to attend to than letting a nurse dictate when she was well enough to lead her kingdom through its darkest hour in centuries.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waited impatiently as several minutes passed. Her legs grew stiff. She tried curling them on the bed, but her side protested too much. At last, a knock sounded at the door and Wymar poked his head through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess?” he asked uncertainly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla beckoned him to enter. “Please, come in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m glad to see you’re awake,” he said. “How are you feeling?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well enough, considering,” Xayla said. “Nilda tells me I’ll recover with some rest.” She gestured dismissively. “But I didn’t call you here for pleasantries. Tell me—how bad is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar pulled up a chair from beside the hearth and sat with a heavy sigh. “Where to even start,” he said, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “We broke the siege—that much is clear. But the cost…” He trailed off, shaking his head. “We haven’t finished tallying casualties from the recent battle, but early projections suggest we’re looking at four-hundred thousand deaths before this blight is fully repelled. The eastern lands bore the brunt of it. Jarrensvale was utterly destroyed, and Castletown is in ruins. We managed to keep them from pushing further west, at least. As for our forces, the northern contingent has maybe twenty-thousand soldiers left in fighting shape, and the countryside is crawling with smaller, leaderless bands of Blin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s heart sank. It was every bit as bad as she had feared. “My memory is hazy,” she said. “The last thing I recall clearly is healing that soldier at the northwest gate. What happened after I collapsed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar clasped his hands and leaned back slightly. “At first, with you leading the charge, they broke completely. A total rout. We swept the field clean—it was like something straight out of a folktale.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And then Avalia’s boon faded?” Xayla suggested.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded grimly, his gaze distant. “I don’t understand it. If she had just stayed with us a little while longer…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She?” Xayla frowned at him. “Wymar, it was <i>me</i> with you the whole time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar narrowed his eyes. “Respectfully, Princess, you weren’t yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hesitated. “I… see.” That unsettled her. What had happened while she was unconscious?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your magic was a terror to behold,” he said. “You inspired fear in the enemy like nothing I’ve ever seen. But when you fell, they rallied. The fight that followed was… costly. We won the day, but only just.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How many of them remain?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s hard to put an exact number on it,” Wymar said, rubbing his chin. “Somewhere between one and two-hundred thousand, most likely on the lower end—unless there’s a larger group still out there somewhere. You managed to kill one of the Warlords, and that sent them into disarray.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait—<i>one</i> of the Warlords?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar muttered a curse. “Yes, just the one. Reports indicate at least one more out there—possibly two.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s eyes went wide. “How is that even possible?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not a philosopher or historian, Princess,” Wymar said with a shake of his head. “I couldn’t tell you. But there is some good news—the southern forces won out, and they still have about fifty-thousand in fighting shape. They’re pushing the remaining organized resistance back to Talus. With luck, they’ll buy us the time we need to recoup and muster more forces. As bad as it is, it could be much worse.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded, absorbing it all in silence. The weight of everything that had happened—she was drowning in it, completely out of her depth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She met Wymar’s eyes. He looked away, shifting uncomfortably in his seat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wymar? What aren’t you saying?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>He drew in a sharp breath and crossed his arms. “I’m sorry, Princess. Your father is dead. I hate to be the one to tell you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The news didn’t hit as hard as she’d expected. It was sad, but not heartbreaking. Still, the finality stung. Until now, she’d clung to a thread of hope. What she lost now was only that—hope itself. In truth, Father had died five months ago. She was well past mourning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Xayla said softly. “How did it happen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There was an attack on his chambers during the assault,” Wymar said. “A rogue Veilwyrd faction.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s pulse quickened. “Vesyrn?!” She leaned forward sharply—too sharply. Pain flared in her side and she winced.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar rose to help her, but she waved him off. “I’m fine. Please, continue—was it Vesyrn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded and settled back into his chair, his mouth drawing into a thin line. “Yes, it was him. We’re still piecing together the full extent of his treachery. The Veilwyrd are in disarray—Vian is dead, Allanah is missing and presumed dead. The rest, at least those we’ve managed to locate, have been detained pending investigation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s blood ran cold. “And Nira? Is she with them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar grew stiff. He didn’t answer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her breath caught. “No,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “Wymar, please—tell me she’s with them. Tell me she just hasn’t been found yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar met her eyes, his expression grave. “I’m so sorry, Princess. I know how close you were. She fell defending your father.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world collapsed around her. Xayla sank back into her bed, distant and numb.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You can take solace in knowing she died a hero,” Wymar said from somewhere far away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Wymar,” Xayla said quietly. “Please leave me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>In a world that was not hers, a door swung closed.</span>
<br><br>

<span>Xayla stood before the gathered masses in the castle’s Sanctum, dressed in regal splendor. The High Bishop was giving a speech—something about faith and unity in dark times. She couldn’t focus. Her mind kept wandering back to that day, scarcely a week past yet feeling like an eternity. She’d stood not twenty paces from here, cowering before assassins and praying to Avalia for salvation. All traces of what happened were gone now—scrubbed clean, the window bricked up and covered with a thin facade. A fitting analogy, she supposed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked to her right, to the clustered soldiers in formal dress. And to the man who stood at their fore.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why did it have to be this way?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sure, he was a hero. Sure, he’d saved thousands of lives. And she wasn’t angry with <i>him</i>—she respected him. The whole realm owed him a debt of gratitude. If only more had his valor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was just—in the grand scheme of things, did his life really matter that much? She’d had all the power of a goddess coursing through her veins. She could have saved Father. She could have saved <i>Nira</i>, had she known she was in danger. She might have even stopped Vesyrn, recovered the fragments of Mind, and still had time to lead the armies afterward. Instead, Avalia sent her after this man. So much time wasted on a poor fool who’d charged headlong into certain death, knowing full well he wouldn’t make it back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps in time the pain and the anger would fade. But now was not that day. If she ever met the Mother again, they would have <i>words</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The High Bishop had concluded his speech, and now the High Priestess was saying her prayer. “From Avalia, Holy Mother Above, we ask her blessing. From Caelon, we ask her wisdom of mind to guide us. From Vaka, we ask her strength of will to defend our realm. And from Nenore, we ask her courage of spirit to see us through the darkness.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla knelt as the High Priestess placed the Crown upon her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Rise, with the blessings of the Goddesses! All hail, Queen Xayla Numenia Proventia Avendar!"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hail, Queen Xayla!” voices echoed back in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“All hail, the Queen of Avendal!” the Priestess exalted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hail, Queen of Avendal!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stepped forward and received a golden scepter from the High Bishop. The two of them stepped back to stand at either side, and she recited the trite speech the Council had given her.</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span>After the ceremonies, Xayla retreated to her study, hoping to distract herself from the weight of responsibility pressing in from every direction—even for just a moment. But it was no use. Her studies had lost their luster, and her mind kept wandering to other matters. Perhaps when this was all over, she could return to them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much to think about. Her kingdom teetered on the brink of ruin. So many had died. Leaderless bands of Blin marauded across the countryside, and the armies had yet to reclaim Talus. And it baffled her that there were multiple Warlords behind the Blight to begin with—their kind had never coordinated like this before. What had changed? Who was “the Lynx” that the messenger mentioned? Where did Vesyrn go with her stolen fragments of Mind, and who had them now? Who was this “Exiled King” that sent the assassins after her?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s thoughts drifted to her visions. The mountain and earthquakes—clearly the Blight. The Caelydri had promised to investigate the Avali River flowing backward, though she’d never had the chance to follow up. She still meant to. But what of the great shadow moving across the desert and over the sea? Had that already come to pass, or did it still lie ahead?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She could leave the fighting to the Lord General and let the Council handle recovery efforts—they hardly needed her interference. But what should <i>her</i> role be? She’d always wanted to be a strong ruler like Father. Now she was Queen, and felt duty-bound to guide her kingdom through this darkness toward a better future. Yet with so much to do and so many unanswered questions, where should she even begin?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked around at her empty study, pondering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null? Are you there?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ethereal specter had not appeared since that day. Xayla wondered if she ever would again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Three knocks sounded at the door below. The sound echoed through the study, and Xayla felt a pang of loss. She glanced toward the entrance out of habit, expecting to see Anli—but her handmaiden wasn’t there. She hadn’t heard from the girl since before the expedition. That felt like a lifetime ago now. She hoped Anli was safe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He’s here, Your Grace,” a guardsman announced.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you. Send him in,” she called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla placed a marker in her book and rose, making her way down the stairs. She poured herself a cup of wine at the table below, and another for her guest. Speaking of…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, Arlinkar,” she said with a smile, extending her hand. “I’m so glad we could finally meet under better circumstances.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man sauntered up to her uneasily, casting furtive glances in every direction. He walked with a cane, and his chest was heavily bandaged. Even with magic, it would be several days before he was fully healed. She would have to see what she could do to make him more comfortable.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took her hand and bowed his head. “Just ‘Ari,’ if you don’t mind, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari it is,” Xayla said, gesturing to the table. “Please, sit. We have much to discuss.”</span>
<br><br>
