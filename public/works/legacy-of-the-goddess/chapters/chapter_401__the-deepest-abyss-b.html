<span>—An unsettling sensation washed over Ari, like grasping at the remnants of a fading nightmare.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His eyes snapped open to find himself standing on solid ground, the team around him coming to their senses as they helped each other free from their bonds. A deafening roar shook the cavern and echoed in Ari’s ears as Kith’raxis emerged from the darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Half-remembered images flashed through his mind—a tail like a cracking whip, followed by fire, death, and a hungering maw. The taste of phantom smoke and the stench of burning flesh still lingered in his senses.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen up!” he cried out. “That thing’s tail whips faster than even I can dodge, and it has fire breath that covers a massive area. If anyone moves in alone, they are <i>dead</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn met his eyes from across the raised stone dias as she worked to untie Koja. She gave him a subtle, determined nod. They both knew what price had been paid.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja glanced between them, then shot him a sardonic look as she flexed her wrists and rose to her feet. “Figured that out the hard way, did you?” There was no humor in her voice, only grim understanding.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari, you…?” Kellin stopped herself, her expression a mixture of concern, awe, and fierce admiration. Her hand moved instinctively to where her sword should have been, and she muttered a curse as she grasped only air. “Sir, orders?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu took command immediately as his binds were freed. “Positions!” he barked, and both teams scrambled to comply. “Gazra, Grenja—coordinated pincer from the front. Draw its attention—bait its attacks but play it safe. Jedal, Koja—support magic. Keep our fighters Lucky.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ancient Voidspawn god fixed its burning gaze upon them, continuing its approach with steps that shook the ground and reverberated throughout the cavern.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Kellin, Ryn, with me—ranged ice attacks, target those hot spots,” Izu continued without missing a beat. “Stay mobile!” He turned to Ari with the unyielding steel of a seasoned commander: “Ari—put that overgrown lizard down.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari grunted an acknowledgement as he crouched among the bone-littered debris, searching for a more serviceable weapon than the broken sword from before. Working quickly through the grim remains, he pried a dented heater shield from beneath a ribcage and spotted a javelin clutched in the death-grip of a long-dead warrior. Not his first choice, but he didn’t spot anything better and was running out of time. The weapon came free with a wet crack as sinew gave way to a firm tug. He hefted the javelin, testing its weight and balance, then joined the team as they circled around wide, keeping distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another roar echoed through the cavern as Kith’raxis bore down upon them with pure seething malice, its approach marked by tremors that made the bones at their feet rattle. Liquid fire pulsed in the veins along its spine and tail, casting dancing shadows on the cavern walls.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal began drawing up motes of green energy as the two red-imbued warriors advanced with grim determination to meet the dread beast—but even Gazra paled in comparison to the lumbering monstrosity. “Fick me right sideways,” Jedal shouted, his hands glowing as he wove streams of Luck into a shell around the fighters. “That’s more demon than any of us bargained for.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Steady!” Izu cried out. “We’re not going to win a fair fight against that thing—just avoid its tail and fire breath while we figure out how to take it down.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Like hell we won’t,” Grenja growled, cracking his knuckles. “I’ve killed bigger things than this.” A red-tinged aura flickered across his body.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The fick you have,” Koja said flatly as she flicked a burst of sparks at the beast from range.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ancient Gekkar god ignored her feeble attack as it fixed its burning gaze on Grenja, closing in. It dropped its massive head, coiled its limbs, then lunged forward with speed that should have been impossible for something so large.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja met it head-on, dove sideways at the last second, planted his feet, and drove an empowered blow into the creature’s left forelimb that would have reduced granite to dust—but Kith’raxis merely flinched and let out an annoyed snarl.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Plenty more where that came from!” Grenja taunted, his confidence unshaken as he rolled away from a clawed stomp that made a small crater where he’d just been standing. “I’m just getting started!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mate, he barely felt that!” Jedal cut back. “Now ain’t the time to get cocky!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra seized the brief opportunity, charging forward with a bestial roar. His transformed body surged with primal energy, muscles rippling as he leaped onto the beast and latched onto its neck. His claws found purchase between armored scales, and he raked them across its face and throat. Kith’raxis snapped and bucked and twisted as it tried to dislodge him, but Gazra held on with a feral tenacity. Finally, it sat back and swiped with a surprisingly dexterous hindlimb that sent Gazra tumbling along the ground, blood streaming from gashes across his body.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gazra down!” Izu called out, but gave no other orders. Ari winced as his eyes tracked Gazra in his periphery—wounded but still breathing, transformation already starting to fade. Worse for wear, but he’d live.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kith’raxis rounded on Grenja with a deep inhale, flames beginning to churn in its throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fire breath!” Ari shouted. “Grenj, get back! Everyone down!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kith’raxis reared back, its chest glowing bright as the air around it shimmered with heat. Grenja turned and broke into a sprint, diving for cover behind the dias—but didn’t quite make it in time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The cone of flame swept across the platform, washing over his cover. He let out a strangled cry of agony as the inferno roared above his head, the heat so intense that the back of his tunic caught fire. He rolled along the ground to extinguish the flames, smoking and charred. The rest of the team crouched low behind scattered debris from a safe distance as superheated air blasted overhead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja!” Koja’s scream tore from her throat, raw and desperate. She lunged forward without thinking, magic crackling wildly around her hands as panic overrode all tactical sense. Izu snatched her by the shoulders, stopping her from charging headlong into the monster’s reach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bursts, now!” he commanded as the flames died down. “Hit it while it recovers! Jedal, assist Grenja! Ari, wait for my mark!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“On it, Cap!” Jedal replied as he took off. Ryn and Kellin covered him with magic as shards of razor ice streaked toward the beast, striking its flank and head. Where they hit, molten blood oozed from its wounds, the fire in its veins flickering and dimming.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s working!” Kellin shouted. “Focus fire!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal slid to Grenja’s side, his hands glowing green as he pushed healing energy into the man’s wounds. Grenja responded with broken gasps and a pained groan. “Come on, stay with me,” Jedal said, his voice steady despite the chaos around them. “I’ve got you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu coordinated the ranged attacks with hand signals as Kith’raxis staggered under the barrage, searing ichor spattering across stone and dirt as it recoiled and raised an armored forelimb for cover. He waited for just the right moment, then hurled an ice spear straight at an exposed underbelly that pulsed with a sickly glow. It struck true, the ice sinking deep into the creature’s flesh and drawing out a horrible roar.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There—an opportunity! “Ari, take it down!” came Izu’s command, but he was already moving.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s pulse quickened as he—no. He froze mid-stride, fragments of visions flickering through his mind—he’d seen this exact moment before. The beast was wounded but far from finished. <i>Negative. Caution,</i> he telepathically sent to Izu to avoid drawing the beast’s attention. He instead took the opportunity to improve his position, skirting around to flank the creature from behind while keeping distance from its tail.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Code-three, acknowledged!” Izu replied. “Team, hold back! Jedal, report?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He’s not doin’ so hot, but he’s alive,” Jedal’s voice was strained but determined as he worked healing energies into their scorched and battered companion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Focus on extraction!” Izu ordered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“On it!” Jedal rose to his feet to grab Grenja in a soldier’s carry, but Kith’raxis didn’t give him the chance. It lunged and swept its tail in a wide arc, catching Jedal off-guard and sending him sprawling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey! Over here you ficking salamander!” Koja shouted, her voice filled with rage as she unleashed a charged ball of electricity at the beast. It barely registered the attack as the crackling energy dissipated against its armored hide, but she succeeded in drawing its attention. Kith’raxis turned its head, fixing its baleful gaze on the woman with a snarl as it plodded towards her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Jedal? Report!” Izu demanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just a bit shaken up,” he replied, his voice strained as he struggled to his feet. Simultaneously, Null’s form danced upon the aether above the heads of the ranged fighters and magic support. Tendrils of iridescent chromatic light—teal and purple and rose—flowed from her to each of them, restoring their magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just get him out of there! Keep up suppressive bursts, stay moving!” Izu called out, his eyes fixed on the beast as streams of ice and electricity arced toward it. “It’s hurt, but we need to regroup.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>As Jedal reached Grenja’s side for the second time, Kith’raxis turned and rose to its full height with a menacing snarl, looming over them like a living mountain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Jedal, abort!” Izu shouted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal pivoted and ran, getting clear of the coming attack. But Grenja lay prone, unable to move from his injuries.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>NO!</i>” Koja wailed, her voice cracking with desperation as she reached for her brother.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dread god’s full might crashed down like a thunderclap, and a shockwave pitched everyone from their feet as bone snapped and flesh tore beneath Kith’raxis’s mighty paws, leaving a bloody smear across the stone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“GRENJA!” Koja’s scream tore through the cavern, raw and primal. She started toward her brother, but this time it was Kellin who held her back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Coordinate attacks! Let’s get another opening!” Izu shouted, his voice cutting through the horror. “Ari, first chance you get—we won’t get another shot!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another ice spear materialized in his hand and struck the beast’s exposed flank, drawing a furious roar. Koja, red eyes streaming with tears, erupted with torrents of crackling lightning. Kellin and Ryn coordinated with razor ice, striking the molten veins that pulsed along Kith’raxis’s neck and spine. Their combined assault drove the beast back, liquid fire oozing from its wounds as it staggered and raised its forelimbs to block.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s vision burned with rage. It was now or never—do or die. He tossed the javelin aside and raised his shield up like a battering ram as his Red magic ignited, meeting fire with fire. He surged forward, muscles burning, closing the distance in heartbeats, then lunged low, driving into Kith’raxis’s soft underbelly with every ounce of strength he had. Metal bit deep into soft flesh as the shield connected with a sickening crunch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unnatural, molten blood spewed from the wound as Kith’raxis lurched, toppling over and hitting the cavern floor with a rumble as it gasped and wheezed. It writhed in agony, sickly ichor pooling beneath its massive form.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari recoiled in pain as the blood splashed across his face and arms, singeing his skin with its unnatural heat. He staggered back, his shield arm numb from the impact, but he kept his footing. The damnable cur was wounded, but not dead yet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now!” Izu shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos. “Hit it with everything you’ve got!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Magic crashed into Kith’raxis from all sides—ice, lightning, and raw energy converging. The cavern blazed with power as the team unleashed their wrath upon the Voidspawn. Ari closed and raised the shield like a club as he brought it down with all his might. The beast’s skull gave in with a satisfying <i>crack</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Again. Again and again he struck the thing. Over and over he hammered the shield into its skull, each blow sending shockwaves through his arms and spewing fel blood everywhere, yet he continued long after the magical volley ceased and the creature stopped moving. The monster’s burning eyes dimmed, and the fire in its veins died.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finally, it was done.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari collapsed backward, panting as adrenaline faded to exhaustion. The cavern was dead silent, save for his ragged breathing and the distant drip of fetid orange blood pooling on the stone floor.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Koja knelt beside Grenja’s mangled body, shaking with sobs that broke the soul-crushing silence. Gazra, back in human form and sporting fresh scars across his back and torso, limped over to stand guard nearby.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari dragged himself to his feet and made his way over, then dropped to his knees by the pair, placing a blood-singed hand on Koja’s shoulder. She leaned into him, wracked with grief. His magic was completely spent and every muscle in his body ached, but he forced himself to show proper respect. Around him, the others slowly filed in from their combat positions.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He bought us the time we needed,” Izu said reverently, moving to stand over their fallen comrade. “Brave and unyielding to a fault.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just like him,” Gazra added, his voice rough. “Went down fighting. He wouldn’t have it any other way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They stood together in the grim aftermath, the stench of burnt flesh and putrid ichor hanging heavy in the air. Jedal surveyed the team, then cleared his throat awkwardly. “Hate to say it, but someone has to ask—anyone else planning on bleeding to death while we stand around paying our respects?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shot him a sharp, disapproving look. Gazra grunted: “I’m fine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal bowed his head in deference and held up his hands defensively, then moved to examine Ari’s injuries. “Let me get a look at those burns before they get infected, yeah?”
Green motes swirled around his palms, and Ari pulled away from Koja to give him room to work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He started by healing the—supernatural? magical?—burns with Restoration, then used what Ari recognized as Regeneration to augment his natural healing for the various scrapes and bruises. “There—now you’ll live to make selfless and heroic decisions another day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari flexed his newly-healed skin. It still stung and felt tight and restrictive, but his numb mind barely processed the pain. “Thanks, Jedal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Standard warnings, yada yada, no more beatdowns with ancient malign deities until you’re fully healed,” he added, his tone serious despite the levity of his words.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded mirthlessly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Across the cavern, Null’s chromatic form materialized above Ryn, tendrils of teal and purple light flowing down in precise streams to restore her magic reserves. She accepted the restoration with a grateful nod, then jerked her head back as her eyes went white.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An instant later, she shook her head in frustration as her eyes returned to normal. “Scrying’s blocked. More Lightsworn interference?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it’s like the old saying,” Izu said. “‘Mind’s eyes are in the skies.’ We’re deep underground here, even if we can’t see the ceiling.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Rustling and clanking sounds from behind. Ari turned to see Kellin picking her way through the bone-littered debris, apparently searching for anything useful among the grisly remains of past sacrifices. She lifted a rusty sword and examined dented pieces of armor, most too damaged or corroded to be of any use.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Find anything?” Izu asked, just a bit too loud for the solemn moment. He immediately cleared his throat and bowed his head as he drew glances from the team.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just some random scraps of armor and some unserviceable weapons,” Kellin replied, kicking aside a broken spear shaft. “Nothing worth salvaging, I’m afraid.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A heavy silence settled over the group as they each found their own way to process what had happened. Ari remained kneeling beside Koja, his hand resting on her shoulder as she grieved. Gazra stood watch, while the others formed a loose circle around their fallen comrade, heads bowed in quiet tribute.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null’s ethereal form materialized above them, her usual prismatic hues dimmed to a soft, deep violet. She hovered motionless for a long moment, then descended until she was level with the circle and pulsed once before fading back into the aether.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Tears came unbidden to Ari’s eyes, and he was not the only one. He had lost plenty of friends before, but this was different.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja was… a brave man,” he found himself saying, his voice cracking. “As brave as any I’ve ever known. He fought like a true hero to the bitter end. He will be remembered, always, and we are all worse for his passing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He is lost, but not forgotten,” came the chant from the group in unison, repeating the solemn words of the Faith. A fresh fit of sobs came from Koja, and Ryn stepped forward to comfort her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aye, that,” Jedal said, his voice low and somber. “Feisty bastard,” he said, taking a moment to mull over his words. Ari sensed he was struggling to find the right bit of humor, but thought better of it. “Never did know when to back down.” He turned away, eyes glassy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja was the best of us,” Izu added, his voice steady but quiet. “He fought with valor, and honor, and died protecting us. We owe it to him to make sure his sacrifice wasn’t in vain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>It should have been me,</i> a voice inside Ari’s head whispered, but he pushed it down. The rest of the team had survived, and that was what mattered. They had to keep moving, had to find a way out of this hellish place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He scanned the cavern again, taking in the impossible scale of their prison. It was impossibly vast, the ceiling lost in shadow despite the eerie crimson glow that seemed to emanate from everywhere at once. The stone dais at the center of the cavern was an island of smooth rock in a sea of dirt, bone, and scattered debris from countless sacrifices.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence stretched on, heavy with grief and exhaustion. Finally, Ryn cleared her throat. “What now?” Her voice was steady but blunt, practical even in mourning. She gestured over her shoulder. “That lift isn’t coming back down any time soon, and even if it does…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She didn’t need to finish. They all knew what waited above.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We can’t stay here,” Ari said. He cleared his throat. “We have to find a way out.” He looked to Izu, who nodded in response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Agreed,” Izu said. “And there’s only one way out—through that crevasse.” He gestured toward the far end of the cavern, where Kith’raxis had emerged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari bid himself to rise to his feet. He took point without further thought, leading the others through the darkness.</span>
