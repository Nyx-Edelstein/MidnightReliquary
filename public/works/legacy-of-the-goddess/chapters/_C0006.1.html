<span>A knock at the door stirred Zelda from her sleep. She had dozed off by the hearth. She wasn’t sure what time it was, but at least a few hours had passed; the fire was dying down, but the embers were still warm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enter,” she called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link. He stepped inside and closed the door behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, come in, please. Have a seat.” Zelda rubbed her eyes and sat up straight. “Any news?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a sigh, he shook his head and took a seat across from her. “We put out bounties. That’s about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her guardsman had identified two assassins in the crowd that attempted to shoot her during the speech. Their attack was followed up by two more assailants rushing her with bombs—one from the crowd and another from the secured rear exit. Those two didn’t survive the attack, and the shooters escaped in the ensuing chaos. No one knew if there were any additional actors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda was lucky to be alive, and she knew it. Two of her guardsmen had died protecting her, and another sustained minor injuries. To top it off there were six dead civilians, and at least a dozen others in the crowd who were wounded. Laylith—the second of her two new Sheikah guards—had also collapsed from magical exhaustion. Thinking quickly, the veteran Sheikah had entombed the second attacker in ice, preventing his bomb from harming anyone else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link,” Zelda said, leaning forward to touch his knee. “I never properly thanked you. You saved me today, and I wouldn’t be here right now if it weren’t for you. Thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link rubbed his neck, cheeks showing a bit of color. “Heh. That’s my job, isn’t it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She smiled. He looked away. Zelda leaned back, studying him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think it could be the same group from before?” Zelda asked curiously, changing the subject. “You know—like the messenger said. ‘The Exiled King?’” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “I don’t know who else it could be. Vesyrn? But he had an opportunity to kill you before and didn’t take it. And not much has really changed since then.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda winced at his casual recounting of the events. “The Seekers?” she offered. “Vestele did say they had ‘considered’ their options. A tad ominous if you ask me. If I were being cynical… could it have been a rogue group?” She shook her head, correcting herself. “But no—that doesn’t make sense. Vestele was there too. Why would they use bombs?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded slowly, gaze unfocusing into the distance. Zelda waited patiently as he considered his thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re right,” he said at last. “That doesn’t fit. I don’t want to assume for certain it was the same group as before, but it’s probably safe to work from there until we get more information. Either way, I think there might be informants in the castle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda did a double take; that caught her by surprise. She hadn’t considered the possibility. “What makes you say that?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To start, they were too well-coordinated,” Link said, eyes focused on the dying embers of the fire. “The shooters fired at the same time—just as the other two rushed the stage. That means they either coordinated the timing with a signal or by using telepathy, or they arranged the timing beforehand using something like a point in your speech as the trigger. But the crowd was too dense and the sight lines just weren’t there for non-magical communication, and Laylith would have seen had anyone been on the rooftops. Since she didn’t, and since they didn’t use any Blue magic in the attack—opting for bow shots and bombs instead—I have to assume none of them were Blue mages. Unless there was someone else working with them in the crowd that didn’t participate in the attack, that leaves only one possibility. They knew you’d be giving a speech there, and they knew what you were going to say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gasped, seeing the logic plainly for herself. By the Mother—he was right!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There’s more,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shot him a glance. “More?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think the bombs came from Talus,” he said. “I heard that almost all of them were used in the initial assault—but still. There aren’t any other compromised stockpiles I know of. That sort of thing would be caught and reported immediately. As far as I know, the Gerudo don’t have the resources to make bombs. Just us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…But if all that’s true, that would mean…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It would mean there’s a faction of Gerudo working with the Blin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They sat in stunned silence as the realization sunk in. Zelda evaluated the implications. “I suppose that would explain their coordination?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head. “No. That doesn’t explain anything, actually.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda fought against her urge to argue back. She knew by now that he’d explain himself of his own accord. Eventually.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why would they work with the Gerudo when they don’t even work with themselves most of the time?” he said after a moment. “There’s something missing still.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what other alternatives are there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A question for the Lynx, perhaps,” Zelda pondered aloud. A thought occurred to her. “Link? I’d like you to be there. During the communications. You are insightful, and have a unique way of looking at things. I want to hear your take on anything they have to say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I, uh… yeah,” he said. “Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I’ll be there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In the meantime,” Zelda said, turning her attention to the hearth. “Any other ideas on what to do about this fiasco?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I already sent messages to the Lord General, and to all the High Captains. I also put Cove on investigating the guard and staff. I’ll get Laylith on it too once she’s recovered, but to be honest I’m not sure what else to do right now. Maybe we should assign more Sheikah to the task? I know they’re busy elsewhere, but your security is important too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Proactive as ever. “Thank you again, Link,” Zelda said. “I really appreciate your work. And your skills. You’re amazing, you know? I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s nothing,” he said, blushing again. “I mean, I think it was the fragment more than anything.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re welcome, Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He cocked his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Say it,” she commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. No ‘uh’s,” she said. “Say it just like I did. With a straight face.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He regarded her, expression unreadable. “You’re welcome, Zelda,” he said at once, in a mock imitation of her voice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She couldn’t help but laugh out loud at that. “Okay, wiseass,” she said, rolling her eyes and throwing a pillow in his general direction. He joined in her laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey! You told me to!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why did it feel like she was forgetting something? Oh right—that’s because she was. “Before I forget, I think we should try and augment the guard. There has to be some soldiers or retired veterans in the city? You and the Sheikah would vet them thoroughly, I’m sure. I trust—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, that won’t work," he interrupted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scoffed. “Okay, then. Why not?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Well,</i>” Link said, “besides that I’ve already considered it, anyone who can hold their own in a fight has already been conscripted by now. Also, it’s too risky. It would be the perfect opportunity for an assassin or an informant. I’d even bet that’s how the other ones got in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Damn this man. Zelda wasn’t ready to cede the point, but she also didn’t want to bet against him being right again. “Fine,” she said. “But what about the city guard? There <i>have</i> to be some able bodied people willing to volunteer overtime for patrol duty. If nothing else, it would keep crime down and make it easier to suss out the assassins?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded. “I asked about that too. They told me Prime Counselor Taetus was working on it? They didn’t seem too keen on me interfering.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Taetus?</i> “What? Guard duty? That doesn’t… what does that have to do with the food shortage?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “I didn’t ask.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed. “I suppose I’ll have to check up on him later.” She stretched and stifled a yawn. “Anyway,” she said, putting the thought aside for now. “It’s getting late. I should get back to bed, but I’d like it if you slept nearby from now on. I’d feel safer that way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link?” She glanced over to him. He sat upright, rigid as a board. His face looked as if it were trying to out-compete the hearth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I mean—not like that!” Zelda quickly amended. “I’m sorry, that’s not what I meant, Link.” <i>Ugh.</i> She buried her face in her palms. How could she be so thoughtless? Was there anything she could say at this point that wouldn’t make it worse?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I get it,” Link said, shoulders slumping. “You’re a Queen. And I’m just your bodyguard.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Zelda blurted out before her mind could catch up with her. “It’s… uhm… it’s more complicated than that,” she said, stammering as she fought to stay on top of her thoughts. “Believe me, you’re a <i>wonderful</i> man. Any woman would be lucky to have you. You’re kind, and intelligent, and you are <i>so</i> brave. You’re a treasure to the entire kingdom, Link! I wish there were more people like you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But?” he said, tersely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda winced. She knew how that had to sound.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But I don’t prefer men,” she said in a small voice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Oh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He suddenly found interest in everything else in the room except for her. “So that’s why you and Sera—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yep.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Okay. Yeah that makes a lot of sense now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uncomfortable silence. It dragged on way too long, even by Arlinkar standards. Zelda had no idea what else to say.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I should go,” Link said abruptly, standing to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda made to stop him, but her tired mind wasn’t doing her any favors. She crossed her arms, head coming to rest on one hand. “Goodnight!” she called after him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodnight,” Link called back. He left and closed the door, leaving her to stew in embarrassment and reflect on her clumsy handling of the situation probably every night for the rest of her life.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“He’s stolen all the rupees in town!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And raided our food stores!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—He dragged my father out of the house and flogged him in the streets!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And he’s holding public executions every morning at dawn!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Barbaric!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—The savage!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—If that ficking upstart commoner thinks he can just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Silence!</i>” Zelda yelled, slamming her gavel against the block. “The chamber will come to order! Bailiff, clear the room and send for the Prime Counselor. I will hear from him myself!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda clenched her jaw, watching in indignation as Taetus strode into the small chamber like he owned the place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You will explain yourself,” she ordered, not giving him a moment’s pause. “Now!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus stopped abruptly, peering around the room. The only ones present besides the two of them were her guardsmen. “You charged me with solving the food crisis, did you not?” he said casually. “I am only doing as you commanded.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By stealing from the Noble Houses?! By flogging city lords in the street, and executing criminals for show?! You <i>cannot</i> expect me to believe that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He smiled with that <i>infuriating</i> grin. “Your Grace—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do <i>not</i> want to hear your lies, Taetus! You have no idea how close I am to ordering my guard to bring me your head!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rose up tall, lifting his chin in defiance. “Shall I explain myself, Your Grace, or do you intend to continue yelling at me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do not test my patience!” Zelda spat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stood still, with hands squared behind his back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a moment to get a grip on her anger. “You may proceed,” she said through grit teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” Taetus said calmly. “Please; hear me out fully before you come to judgement.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda continued to glare.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“While the ultimate problem is food," he began, “most of our issues stem simply from overpopulation. Castletown is nearly five times over capacity, and there is nowhere else to send the refugees. There are more bodies than can be fed, and not only are they not doing anything useful; many of them are adding to the difficulties.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But how do you put them to work? We must <i>pay</i> them, and we must <i>feed</i> them.” He slammed one hand against the other to punctuate the words. “The Crown’s coffers alone are not enough. And since the nobles are content to sit on their riches and watch the common folk around them starve and kill each other over scraps, I have <i>temporarily</i> taken the money and half of the food stores so as to put it to better use.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And before you object,” he said, raising a finger. “they have been compensated with bonds and scrip. Presuming the kingdom makes it through this crisis, they will be all the richer for it. In the meantime, I’ve charged the local city lords with managing their districts, and have begun issuing scrip for them to distribute to the populace as they see fit. It is to be awarded for honest work, and can be exchanged at stations I’m setting up throughout the city for basic goods and food—mainly soup and bread. Secondarily, this will allow the common folk to barter among themselves, thus allowing those with surplus to exchange their unneeded goods for food and other necessities. As a result, everyone will have greater access to food, which will give us room to make progress on the other issues.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And this is, of course, all financed by the confiscated wealth,” he said, winding down. “Every part of it is <i>entirely</i> necessary, Your Grace. I would not do it if that were not so.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Even the floggings?” Zelda said dubiously. There was no way he was getting away with that—damned be his reasoning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Count Marlas of House Nen refused to acknowledge the Crown’s authority,” he said with confidence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Taetus, you <i>arrogant shit!</i>” Zelda spat. “It doesn’t matter what I charged you with! You <i>cannot</i> provoke the nobility like that!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But that is where you are wrong, Your Grace. <i>Your father</i> would not have hesitated—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>My father</i> would not be executing criminals in the streets just to make a point!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>King Gaillard</i> would not have sat idly by and watched the order in his city fall to thugs and gangs to begin with!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two of them glared at each other as the words settled. Zelda <i>seethed</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There will be no more flogging of nobles,” she said quietly. “And no more public executions. Now get out of my sight, before I reconsider letting you live.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command. Your Grace,” Taetus said with a curt bow. He turned, and departed the chamber.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda strode through the castle corridors in the evening light on the way back to her study. It had been yet another long and stressful day. She wasn’t sure what she would do when she got there, but any measure of respite would be welcome after the past two days’ events.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait! Your Grace!” a voice called from behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Or not. She recognized the boyish voice as belonging to Cove. She hung her head, turning around. “Yes? What is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh. Sorry to bother you,” he said, catching up to her. “Nothing urgent. It’s just, well—I think these belong to you?” He produced a small box, opening the lid.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside were her lost bracers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Cove!” Zelda exclaimed, snatching them from the box. There was no mistaking it; she recognized their draw instantly. These were <i>her</i> bracers. She traced her fingers along the ridges of their golden emblems. “How did… what? I don’t… how did you come by these?” she looked up. “Has Vesyrn been captured?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Cove shook his head, putting the box away. “No, Your Grace. I’m sorry, but I don’t know anything except for what I was told. They were handed to me by one of the other agents you sent after the roving Blin, when he last checked in. Malg, I think his name was? He said they were found on the body of a moblin that was killed in an attempted raid somewhere about a day’s ride to the north.” He scratched his head. “What a crazy coincidence, huh?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda laughed uneasily. “Yeah. What a crazy coincidence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He eyed her warily. She hurried to change the subject. “Do you know if they found anything else by chance?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not that I’m aware of,” he answered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Slowly, Zelda slid the bracers back over her wrists. They fit snug to her skin. It felt <i>right</i> to do so; like some essential part of her had been missing all this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re magical artifacts, aren’t they?” Cove asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started. “What? Oh, no,” she lied. “Just a sentimental family heirloom. I inherited them from my mother. I don’t have much left from her, so they’re very special to me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s okay. I understand,” Cove said. “Your secret is safe with me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed, covering her face with her palm. “Thank you, Cove.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t mention it—it’s what I’m here for!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was there anything else?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nope, that’s all,” he said cheerfully. “Oh, uh. Still no updates on the assassins, if that’s what you’re wondering.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda curtsied before him. “Thank you again, then. And pass on my thanks to Malg too, please. He has my gratitude.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, Your Grace,” the young man said with a bow. “My pleasure to serve.” He turned and sauntered off, whistling to himself as he went.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda sat comfortably against the carriage window, appreciating the scenery. It was a mild and breezy day in the middle of Calm. Their path followed a winding ravine off to the left, with a dense green forest to her right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But where were they, again? She couldn’t recall…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This doesn’t look right,” a feminine voice at the reigns ahead said. She sounded concerned. Zelda couldn’t place it, but the voice was somehow familiar. “I think we’re lost,” the voice said. “We should turn back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nonsense, Rirra,” Father said, gruff. “I’ve ridden this trail many times. We’ll be back at the pass an hour before sundown. Just try and relax.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…<i>Rirra</i>? That was Mother’s name!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother!” Zelda called. “Father?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>They didn’t seem to hear her. She repeated herself, edging toward the front of the cabin. “Mother? It’s me, Zelda!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She slid the front hatch open. It was nighttime now, and the wind had picked up. It howled in her ears and she put her hand up to shield her face. Ahead, two figures sat in darkness, silhouetted by a distant moon on the horizon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With rising trepidation, Zelda reached out to tap on the shoulder of the smaller figure to the right. Just as she made contact, her mother’s corpse jerked back and let out a soul-piercing wail; face gaunt and skeletal, with empty eyes staring out into the abyss. Zelda screamed, falling back inside the cabin in a panic. The hatch slammed shut, and the carriage sped up to the sound of horses roaring and squealing. The cabin floor rocked violently under her and she lost her footing, falling onto something cold and stiff sitting in the same seat she had just vacated. Zelda screamed again, forcing herself to her feet and whipping around. Pure terror gripped her as she recognized her father’s hollow and lifeless body. His eyes swiveled in their sockets, coming to rest on her. His hand rose, pointing, and Zelda heard another terrible screech that sent her very soul reeling. The cabin shook again and suddenly she was falling. She cried out, gripping the frame with white knuckles as they plummeted into the swift current of the waters below.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda jerked awake, covered in sweat with pulse pounding in her ears. </span>
<br><br>
<span>It was only a nightmare. Just a dream.</span>
