<span>The Obsidian Spire rose from the desert like a black blade thrust into the heart of the Realm. Five massive tiers of volcanic glass, each narrower than the last, crowned by an obelisk that clawed at the sky. Azahndor reined his horse to a halt as the structure came into view, sunlight catching its edges in thin, bright lines that made his eyes water.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Twenty-six years since he’d last stood before these walls. He’d been little more than a boy then—seventeen summers and burning with youthful certainty.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His horse balked as he urged it forward, nostrils flaring at some scent carried on the wind. He pressed his heels in firmly. The animal obeyed, though its ears remained flat against its skull. Smart beast. Even after all this time, the Spire still exuded a cursed air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He dismounted near the entrance, boots sinking into golden sand. Behind him, three lieutenants drew their mounts to a halt. Desert-worn armor, faces wrapped against the wind. Good men. <i>Loyal</i> men who had followed him into exile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One dismounted and took Azahndor’s reins, murmuring to calm the restless animals. The other two positioned themselves on either side of the entrance, hands resting easy on their sword hilts. They knew their duty. They would stand watch until he emerged, whether that be an hour or until they dropped dead from exhaustion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned back to the Spire with different eyes than those he’d brought as a desperate boy seeking to prove his worth. A king’s eyes now. Eyes that had seen death itself conquered within these walls.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>She waits,</i> he thought. <i>Still she waits.</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>He lowered his hood and strode forward without a word.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>The corridor stretched ahead into shadow—exactly as he remembered. Impossibly precise stonework, not a crack or hint of settling despite the millennia. His boots rang against smooth stone. Fine dust covered every surface, sand drifting in delicate patterns that swirled with each step. Eternal stone beneath ephemeral sand. The work of ages yielding to the patient invasion of the desert.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Twenty-six years was a long time to wait. But the waiting was over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused at the threshold to the vestibule, letting his eyes adjust to the dimmer light. Sand and dirt covered every surface—thin layers on the walkways, larger drifts in corners where wind had pushed it into piles. Half-melted candles littered the space, dozens of them on small braziers scattered along the walkways and benches. Pilgrims, then. Or worshippers. The blood-stained altar before the upper door suggested purposes darker than prayer.
</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Fools.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>His gaze lifted to the ornate door at the far end of the upper walkway. Both halves bent inward at the bottom, metal curled inward like petals from the violent impact of that ancient Lightsworn device. His doing, all that time ago.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He climbed the steps, boots leaving clean prints in the dust. The wrecked door opened onto a narrow hallway that widened as he followed it deeper. At its end lay the arena itself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dome stretched above him—vast and circular, supported by four massive pillars that rose from the sand. Light filtered down from nowhere, softer and stranger than true sunlight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This arena had witnessed countless trials in ages past. Criminals and prisoners offered as sacrifice to what lurked below. Young boys staking their lives against death itself. Among the Akhari, merely surviving and escaping this place earned a warrior’s name.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Until he’d ended the practice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And there, half-buried in sand—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, old friend,” he whispered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The carapace of Mor Kharath’s avatar, still intact after all these years. All that remained of something once terrible beyond imagining. Azahndor approached slowly and rested his gauntlet against the chitinous surface.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They had hailed him King Among Kings for killing her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But I didn’t kill you, did I?” His voice echoed in the empty chamber. “Not truly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He’d only postponed the confrontation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor flexed his gauntleted hand, feeling power hum through his veins. Seven fragments now. Seven pieces of the Sanctern of Will, the most recent additions liberated by the Khamsyr from Kiat the Warmonger—some ancient Baastani pack leader out of the Novali Badlands who’d held them for gods knew how long.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The spiral teardrop shape was nearly complete. He could see it plainly, etched in silver light across the back of his hand. Only two more shards remained.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The raw might of Vaka, nearly at his command.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His fingers curled into a fist. The fragments pulsed brighter, responding to his will. Power thrummed against his bones like a second heartbeat—vast, hungry, and <i>eager</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He’d needed time, then. Time to grow strong. Time to prepare.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But the time had come.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We have unfinished business, you and I.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Twenty-six years earlier…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The attendants fell like wheat before the scythe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor strode through the carnage, boots splashing through spreading pools of blood. Six robed figures had stood between him and the arena. Six corpses now, their bodies slumped against ancient stone, the last one’s screams still echoing faintly in the enclosed space.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They needn’t have died. He’d offered them the chance to stand aside—but they’d chosen martyrdom over sense, their fanaticism blinding them to the pointlessness of their sacrifice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He snapped his blade to the side, flinging droplets across the stone. The Sword of Kings—claimed by rite of blood. It thrummed in his grip, eager for more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ornate doors stood before him—massive things of worked metal that had been sealed for centuries. Without the cooperation of the attendants, this was the only way in. And he had no chance of opening them. Not on his own, anyway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In his hand, the strange device hummed. A metal half-dome mounted on an ornate frame, covered in symbols he couldn’t read. Ancient Lightsworn work, the Great Elders had told him. A weapon beyond mortal comprehension.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He didn’t need to understand it. He only needed to use it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor raised the device, pointing it at the barrier.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>VREEEEEE—THOOM!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A high-pitched shriek followed by a thundering crack. The metal didn’t bend or shatter—it simply <i>ceased</i>. The doors unraveled like burning parchment, curling inward from the point of impact. When the light faded, the passage beyond stood open, revealing the short hallway that led deeper into the Spire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced at the device. Silent now, its runes dark. The magic spent. He tossed it aside and stepped through the doorway and into the arena beyond.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dome opened before him. Sand covered the floor beneath four pillars that held up the sky. Or something that looked like sky. Light poured down from above, sourceless and strange.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And there, in the center—</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stood perhaps twenty paces away. Dark tan skin gleamed in the unnatural light, long black hair falling past her shoulders in waves. Crimson robes clung to curves that would make poets weep, and golden eyes—molten like pools of liquid metal—fixed on him with uncanny amusement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bold,” Mor Kharath purred, her voice echoing strangely in the vast space. “So very bold, little king.” Her smile widened, revealing teeth just slightly too sharp. “Do you have any idea what you’ve unleashed upon this world?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Merely an old hag playing at godhood,” Azahndor said, hefting the Sword of Kings onto his shoulder with casual confidence. He let his gaze sweep over the arena before meeting her eyes. “Vaka couldn’t make time for you, so I will. Consider this overdue.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her laughter rippled through the arena—layered, discordant. High notes rang from above, while deeper tones resonated somewhere else, all of them bleeding together into something mirthful and mocking. “How precious. They always send me the arrogant ones.” She gestured lazily, and the air shimmered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Images bloomed between them—warriors charging forward one by one, each falling in turn. A giant of a man in golden plate armor, strangled and crushed by writhing tendrils of shadow. A sorcerer in immaculate robes, consumed by black flame that left no ash. A hunter whose arrows split the very air, reduced to pulp by an alien maw.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor’s grip tightened on his sword. His pulse quickened and his blood ran cold—but he stood his ground. <i>Let her try to intimidate me.</i> His patron had already assured him of victory. A deity whose power rivaled Avalia. This creature, for all her posturing, was nothing in comparison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He forced his shoulders square, bringing his sword up to guard position. His heart hammered in his chest, but he kept his voice steady. “Tell me, O <i>great</i> Mor Kharath—did any of those champions have the favor of a god?!” His smile sharpened. “Or were they all just pretenders playing at prophecy?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her expression went still. The amusement bled away—the mockery died on her lips. Those golden eyes hardened into something cold and ancient and <i>furious</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You <i>dare</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She whispered something in a language older than time. Not sound—but <i>sensation</i>. The words scraped against his mind like claws on stone, leaving gouges that would never heal. The temperature plummeted. Frost crept across the sand in spreading webs, crystallizing around his boots. His breath misted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sand erupted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A dozen skeletal forms rose from beneath the surface—withered corpses with gleaming bones and hollow eyes. Remains of those who’d come before him. Those who fell to this demon. They shrieked as they charged, fleshless hands reaching, jaws gaping wide.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor moved.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Sword of Kings severed the first Bonewight at the spine. Momentum carried him through the strike. His left hand snapped up, fingers spread wide, and a sphere of shadow-fire erupted from his palm—writhing darkness threaded with crackling amethyst lightning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It struck the horde dead center. Half a dozen skeletal forms exploded into fragments, their shattered remains scattering across the sand. The shockwave staggered the rest mid-charge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He pivoted, the Sword of Kings sweeping wide in a defensive arc as his left palm snapped up again. The motion flowed from hip to shoulder—ancient forms made reflex through endless kata. Arcing amethyst crackled between his fingers. He released. Two more skeletal forms exploded into fragments.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He coiled inward, gathering his power—knee rising, arm drawing tight to his chest. Then he exploded forward, weight driving from back leg to front in a powerful stride. A wave of shadow-fire erupted in a torrent, consuming everything in its path.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence fell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Where the horde had stood, only scorched bone and patches of fused glass remained.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor straightened, chest heaving. Sweat beaded on his brow despite the cold. His gaze found the woman in crimson robes, still standing in the center of the arena.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her expression flickered—rage bleeding through forced composure. “Impressive.” The word came tight, controlled. “But you remain far from—”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>“ꡡꡡꡌꡯꡘ!”</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>His sword snapped up, the point directing the flow of power. It came instantly—no gathering, no buildup. Just raw, violent release. A bolt of crackling energy erupted from the blade, bridging the distance between them in an eyeblink.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It struck her dead center.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her body seized, arching violently as the energy tore through her. Every muscle locked rigid. Skin blackened and split along crackling lines of char. She collapsed into the sand, crimson robes smoldering, empty eyes staring up at the false sky.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor staggered, breath ragged, pulse hammering. His reserves were spent—that final strike had drained him completely. But it was done. He didn’t even need the sealing—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It started as a woman’s chuckle—soft at first, almost fond. Then it deepened, growing into something vast and monstrous, too large for any mortal throat. The sound swelled, reverberating from places between places that had no names.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sand began to shift.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The corpse remained where it had fallen. But beneath it, something else began to rise. A massive segmented form erupted upwards, each section as thick as a man’s torso. Sand cascaded off its armored surface. Higher and higher it climbed until its maw loomed above him, a tower of chitin and nightmare.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fool!” The voice thundered from everywhere and nowhere, shaking the foundations of the arena. “Do you have ANY idea how long it took me to cultivate that form?! CENTURIES of patient work, UNDONE!” The massive body coiled tighter, segments grinding against each other with sounds like breaking stone. “No matter. I will make you SUFFER for that insult before I devour you whole!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The creature lunged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor threw himself aside as the massive head crashed down, sand spraying where he’d stood. He rolled and came up running, sword heavy in his hands. The creature twisted with impossible speed for something so huge—flowing beneath the sand before erupting again, segments rippling with alien grace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He met it head-on, driving the Sword of Kings into the chitinous surface. The blade skittered across the armor—barely a scratch. The creature reared back, and the impact sent him tumbling across the sand until he skidded to a halt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It didn’t slow. If anything, it moved faster, enraged. The massive body coiled, and suddenly he was surrounded—rings of segmented flesh closing in from all sides, cutting off escape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He scrambled upright, sword raised, words already forming on his lips—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—and the world <i>lurched</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The arena twisted. Reality folded inward upon itself, and suddenly he was falling through spaces that had no names—dimensions that existed only in the fever-dreams of gods.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was in her maw. Not consumed. <i>Becoming</i>. His flesh merged with chitinous plates. His bones hollowed and stretched. His thoughts fractured across segments that reached toward infinity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am the Void that devours all things,” her voice whispered through his dissolving mind. “All will feed me. All will become one with me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Color went first. Not fading to grey—simply <i>ceasing</i>. Sunsets over Kamorh. Blood on steel. His mother’s eyes. The concept itself unmade, leaving only hollow absence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sound followed. Not silence—he knew silence, from long treks across silent deserts. This was the erasure of sound’s <i>possibility</i>. His father’s laugh. His brother’s war cry. Fires crackling in the night. All of it unwritten from reality.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then his body scattered. Each moment of his existence became a grain of sand, pulled in directions that had no shape. His first hunt. His coronation. A thousand fragments of self, dispersing across scattering winds.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tried to remember why he’d come here, but the thought dissolved before it could form. Worse—part of him <i>wanted</i> this. Craved it the way drowning lungs eventually stop fighting and welcome the water.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t being devoured. He was being <i>revealed</i>—a temporary eddy in an infinite current. A brief pattern that had mistaken itself for permanence.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The Void whispered with his own voice, gentle as a lover’s promise: “Why struggle? You were always meant to feed me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something burned against his palm. Metal and will, fused into one. The Sword of Kings. Even as the rest of him scattered, that single point of contact held—an anchor, a thread of purpose that refused to fray.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The words of power. He could still speak them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He drew breath with lungs that existed neither here nor there, and spoke:</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Three years earlier…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A shove sent Azahndor tumbling from the saddle. He hit the ground hard, breath driven from his lungs on impact. The sack over his head reeked of sweat and oxgoat dung. Rough hands seized him—one at his collar, another at his belt—lifting and hurling him into softer sand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something landed in the sand near his head with a soft <i>thump</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rolled onto his back, arms still bound. Voices muttered above—low, gruff, speaking too quickly to catch. Someone pressed a knife into his hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good luck, boy.” Laughter, then footsteps receding. Wood creaked, leather groaned, an oxgoat snorted. Hooves crunched away across packed earth until the sounds faded to nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He lay still until silence settled completely. Then he started working at the rope.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He twisted his wrists and sawed at the bindings, ignoring the burn against his skin. It took longer than it should have. The blade was barely serviceable—not quite dull, but close.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The rope finally parted. He worked his hands free and yanked the sack from his head, sucking in a breath of clean air as his eyes adjusted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Desert sands stretched in every direction. The sun hung low to the west, casting long shadows across crumbling stone structures about fifty paces away. Ancient ruins—half-buried columns and broken walls jutting from the sand like bones.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He pushed himself upright, muscles protesting. His shoulder throbbed where he’d hit the ground. He rolled it experimentally—painful, but the joint moved. Probably just bruised. He’d need to be careful with it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced toward the knapsack a few paces away and crawled over to check its contents. Jerky wrapped in cloth, a satchel of dried glistenberries, flint and steel, a leather sleeping mat. A waterskin sloshed when he shook it—maybe two days’ worth if he was careful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He cut the knot free and coiled the remaining rope into his pack. Might be useful later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stood and glanced about again, brushing sand from his clothes. It would be dark soon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ruins were the only landmark for miles. Not coincidence. He’d known they would bring him here—it’s why he’d started that fight during the trade run.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His pulse quickened as he considered what lay ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>The gateway to the underworld.</i> That’s what they called it. A place where the veil between worlds grew thin, guarded by a demon that had feasted on warriors’ bones for generations.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Most boys dumped at trial sites were expected to fend for themselves. Find water, hunt game, come back with scars and trophies worth bragging about—or don’t come back at all. Few survived.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But Azahndor hadn’t been dumped here by accident. He’d planned this—years spent hiding in tavern basements after dark, listening to old warriors spin their tales. Scraping together wages to pay for tips from those who’d survived trials like this. Sneaking into restricted archives when the Elders weren’t looking, stealing moments with forbidden texts that outlined the true nature of these places.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He’d been caught once, sneaking through the archives. The beating had left him unable to sit for a week. It was worth it, though. He’d learned what he needed—these weren’t just any ruins. They were <i>the</i> ruins. The place where demons walked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And he was going to kill one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shouldered the knapsack, tucked the knife into his belt, and set off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Baptism of Fire. That’s what they called it. Blood and pain and survival—the trial that turned boys into men. Only afterward could they return to claim the final Baptism of Spirit and take their place in Akhari society.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Air, Water, Earth, Fire, Spirit.</i> He’d survived being born—Baptism in Air. He’d knelt in the sacred pool at seven summers—Baptism in Water. He’d endured two years of backbreaking labor, hauling stone until his hands bled and his shoulders nearly gave out—Baptism in Earth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Now came Fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Most boys chose their own trials. Hunts. Pilgrimages. Challenges issued to rival clans. A man’s place in Akhari society depended on how much he risked—and those who staked too little found no welcome among warriors, hunters, or clansmen.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But Azahndor’s family had enemies. Whispers in council chambers. Debts owed to the wrong people. They’d volunteered him for indentured servitude before he could make his own choice—carted him off in the dead of night like they were doing him a favor. He’d be worked until he was useless, then discarded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But he’d spent years preparing for exactly this. When rumors reached him—debts being called in, his name whispered in the wrong conversations—he’d known his time was running out. So he’d positioned himself carefully. Started that fight the moment they reached Karlev. Made himself just inconvenient enough that dumping him at the nearest trial site seemed like the obvious solution.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They thought they’d stripped him of choice. Doomed him. Instead, they’d given him exactly what he wanted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The first ruin was a collapsed archway half-buried in sand. Symbols covered the stonework, worn almost smooth by wind and time. He traced one with his finger—Old Akhari script. Warnings, mostly. <i>Turn back. This is not a place of honor. Death waits below.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Perfect.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He moved deeper into the ruins, boots crunching on sand and silt. The structures formed a rough circle around a central courtyard. The sun hung low now, barely a fist above the horizon, stretching shadows across the sand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He set down his pack and began gathering dry brush. He’d need a fire—warmth against the desert cold, light to work by. Time to prepare for what came next.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t going back empty-handed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was going back a king.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He’d gathered flat stones from the collapsed structures and stacked them into a rough three-sided enclosure around the fire pit. Clay had been harder to come by—he’d had to scrape it from a dried streambed, digging with a scooped stone until he hit the pale, dense earth beneath. He rehydrated it with urine—unpleasant but effective—and packed the mixture into the gaps between stones.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On his third strike, the fire crackled to life. Sparks caught in the dry brush and spread into hungry flames. He fed it slowly, adding twigs first, then larger branches. A roaring blaze would attract unwanted attention—a small, steady fire would serve him better.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The makeshift stove worked better than expected. Heat radiated from the clay-sealed stones, flowing back toward him rather than bleeding out into the desert night.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He positioned himself in the corner formed by two crumbling walls, the stove between him and the open desert. The ruins offered protection on two sides, while the heat would discourage anything larger than a jackalbadger from approaching. Smaller predators—those were easier to deal with.</span>
<br><br>
<span>From his pack, he pulled the kippongu-hide sleeping mat and unrolled it across the sand. He swept the ground first, clearing away loose stones and debris that would dig into his back come morning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One more thing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He fished a small cloth pouch from his pack—stoneveil blossoms inside. Orange petals spotted with dark purple, wrinkled from being pressed together. He’d found them growing in a scraggly cluster beneath an overhang while searching for clay. An old hunter had taught him this trick years ago. The man had been half-mad from sun exposure, but his advice was sound.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He scattered a handful of petals onto the hot stones at the edge of his fire. They sizzled immediately, curling and blackening as thin wisps of acrid smoke rose into the air. He coughed once, then turned his face away as the smell intensified—bitter and sharp, like burnt pepper mixed with tar. The smoke would ward off insects and snakes—anything with enough sense to avoid the scent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Satisfied, he settled onto his mat with his back against the ruins. The stone still held warmth from the day’s sun. The fire crackled softly. Smoke drifted across the sand in lazy coils.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The sun climbed behind him as he circled the ruins again—his fourth time traveling around that morning. More cautious now, examining each collapsed structure with fresh eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He found it on the eastern edge, tucked behind a cluster of broken columns. The opening was barely visible—just a darker shadow where sand had drifted away from the wall’s base. But the stones surrounding it were different. Precise. Deliberate. Not collapsed rubble, but <i>placed</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Someone had sealed this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He knelt and began moving rocks. The smaller pieces came away easily enough, settled loose on top. Beneath those lay larger stones, wedged tight. He worked methodically, testing each one before committing his weight. His injured shoulder protested with every heavy lift, a dull throb sharpening when he twisted wrong.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sun climbed higher. Sweat soaked through his shirt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By midday, he’d cleared enough to reveal the entrance—a rectangular opening barely wider than his shoulders, steps descending into darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sat back on his heels, breathing hard. His hands were raw, palms scraped and bleeding. He wiped them on his pants and returned to his camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The torch took time to prepare. He’d scavenged a long root that morning—twisted and gnarled, pried from a dead scrub tree. He wrapped one end in cloth strips torn from his shirt, then doused them in oil he’d pressed from emberreeds growing near the clay deposits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The reeds had been tricky—crushed between flat stones, the viscous amber liquid collected drop by precious drop. But emberreed oil burned clean and long. After imbuing it with magic, the crude torch would last maybe six or seven hours.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He fashioned a sling next—rope from his knapsack, leather from his bedroll, knotted at both ends with a wider pouch in the middle. Simple, but effective. He’d spent countless hours as a boy whipping stones at targets. Not the best weapon, but it would do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gathered pebbles from around the ruins—smooth ones, roughly uniform. Not ideal either, but they’d shatter bone if thrown hard enough. A few well-placed stones would kill anything. He dropped them into the satchel that previously held the glistenberries and tied it to his belt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sling took careful work to imbue. He held it stretched between his hands, focusing his will through the leather. The material warmed, drinking in the magic until it glowed faintly. When he released his concentration, it felt different. Stronger. More resilient.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ready.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gathered his supplies and lit the torch. The oil-soaked cloth caught immediately, flames spreading in a ring of steady light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused, staring at the flickering Red-tinged flames. The color of his affinity—the magic that had marked him from birth. A secret he’d guarded more carefully than any other.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mages were <i>valuable</i>. Too valuable. The Great Elders would sacrifice a weak one without hesitation if it meant securing favor with the gods. So he’d learned to hide it—never practiced openly, cultivated a reputation for mediocrity instead. Adequate at everything, exceptional at nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Better to be overlooked than a sacrifice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned back to the entrance and descended.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The stairs were worn smooth, each step slightly concave from centuries of use. He counted twenty-nine before the passage leveled into a corridor. The walls pressed close, the ceiling low enough to force him into a slight crouch. Stone blocks fitted together with precision that should not have been possible without modern tools.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The corridor branched. Then branched again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He marked his turns with small piles of sand scraped into corners—easy to miss unless you were looking, easy to find on the way back. The structure sprawled far larger than the ruins above suggested. Rooms opened off the main passages, some collapsed, others intact but empty. Carved reliefs flickered past in his torchlight. Figures in procession. Symbols that might have been prayers or warnings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Time had reclaimed much of it. Rubble choked some passages. Others bore crusted salt deposits from ancient floods.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All passages funneled inward.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He followed them deeper, tracking the subtle downward slope. The air grew cooler. His torch flickered in drafts that came from nowhere.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The passages converged into a circular chamber—maybe thirty paces across, the ceiling lost in shadow above. The floor sloped toward the center, where a large circular opening yawned. He approached slowly, torch held high, and knelt at the rim.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The opening was perhaps three paces in diameter, its edge worn smooth by hands or ropes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He peered down into utter darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No—not quite darkness. Something moved down there. Not shadow, but <i>fog</i>—thick and dark, hanging motionless in the still air. Black motes drifted in defiance of natural law, refusing to rise or settle. And beneath it all, a faint reddish glow pulsed like dying embers in a banked forge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The air felt wrong. Heavy. Pressing against his chest like a physical weight. He swallowed and found his throat dry.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>The gateway to the underworld.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>His pulse hammered. Every instinct screamed at him to turn back—that he’d gone far enough, that he should retreat to the surface and claim some lesser trial, make a life for himself in another village.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But a lesser trial would earn a lesser name—and cowardice was no path to kingship.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rose to his feet and tested his injured shoulder with a careful roll. The pain had dulled to a steady ache—nothing he couldn’t handle. A quick check confirmed his knife sat secure at his belt, while his torch continued burning steadily, casting restless shadows across the chamber walls.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took a breath, then swung his legs over the edge and began to climb down.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The chamber below stretched before him—vast enough that his torchlight couldn’t find the far walls. The black fog hung thicker here, swirling lazily around his boots. Each breath tasted of copper and ash.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And there, directly ahead—</span>
<br><br>
<span>He froze.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The statue towered fifteen feet above him—carved from a single block of black stone shot through with veins of crimson and gold. In his torchlight, they seemed to pulse like blood flowing through living rock.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Six arms spread symmetrically from its torso. One gripped a sword wreathed in carved flames, blade pointing earthward. Another raised something high—a shattered fragment of something greater. The remaining hands held implements he couldn’t name, though power radiated from each one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The face stole the breath from his lungs. Sharp features frozen in an expression both beautiful and terrible. Commanding. Eyes that seemed to track him despite being lifeless stone. Hair flowed upward, each strand defying gravity as if caught in eternal flame. The detail shouldn’t have been possible—stone couldn’t capture motion like that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He would have thought it was Vaka—except the statue was unmistakably masculine. Definitely not one of the Celestial Sovereigns. He’d seen their depictions countless times in temples and scrolls. Vaka was never portrayed like <i>this</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Behind the figure, a massive serpent coiled around the base—thick as ancient pillars, each scale etched with swirling patterns. Multiple heads emerged to form a hood crowning the figure, mouths frozen mid-strike, fangs bared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Carved flames licked upward from the obsidian base, radiating behind the figure’s shoulders. They seemed to <i>flicker</i> in his torchlight—a trick of shadow that made his skin crawl. The armor was impossibly elaborate. Breastplate, pauldrons, greaves—all carved as if forged from darkness itself, channels running through them like molten power frozen before eruption. Beneath one heel, a lotus throne lay crushed. The other foot rested upon a wheel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor’s hands trembled. For a heartbeat, he could have sworn the carved eyes <i>moved</i>—tracking him, measuring him, finding him wanting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He forced himself to breathe.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>A god.</i> Not some petty spirit or demon, as the stories claimed. Something vast and terrible—something that had walked this world before mortals had names for power.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Behind the statue, massive stone doors stood sealed. Their surfaces were covered in unreadable runes, with no handles or hinges visible. Just smooth stone that no mortal hand could move.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps <i>this</i> was the true gateway to the underworld.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He approached slowly, circling the statue with measured steps. His boots crunched on gravel. The figure loomed above—every scale rendered in perfect detail, every strand of hair carved with impossible precision, every finger articulated as if frozen mid-gesture. In the flickering torchlight, surrounded by drifting shadow-motes, it almost seemed alive. The work of centuries. Or magic far beyond his comprehension.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His gaze fell to the base of the statue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A basin was carved into the rock at the figure’s feet—circular, roughly an arm’s length across. The stone there had been worn smooth, polished by countless hands or offerings over the centuries. A narrow slit ran from the basin’s center straight down into the statue’s core.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He understood at once.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Sacrifice.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>His hand found the knife at his belt before conscious thought could intervene. The blade slid free. He wedged his torch between two rocks, leaving it to stand free, then sank to his knees before the towering figure, settling onto cold stone. Those carved eyes seemed to pierce straight through him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He held his left hand over the basin and drew the blade across his palm. A sharp sting, then spreading warmth. Blood welled dark in the flickering light. He clenched his fist, letting it drip freely into the carved stone below.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He watched it drip. Tap. Tap. Tap. “I offer my blood,” he whispered—the words coming unbidden, part prayer, part plea. “My strength. My will. My life, if that’s what you require.” He raised his eyes to meet that carved stone gaze. “Grant me the power to rise above those who cast me aside. To seize what others dare not claim.” His voice steadied, grew stronger. “Make me a king among kings, whose name will echo throughout the ages.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In return—” His voice cracked. He swallowed and tried again, louder this time. “<i>In return</i>, I pledge my loyalty. My service. My undying devotion. I am yours. Now and forever. Until death claims me—and beyond, if you will it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Only silence answered. Just stone and shadow and the steady drip of his blood into ancient darkness. His hand throbbed. How much had he given? Enough? Too much? He remained kneeling, head bowed, waiting for—</span>
<br><br>
<span>A woman’s voice cut through the silence—cold and mocking. “Silly boy. Do you truly believe a god would answer <i>you</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor’s head jerked up, heart pounding as he scanned the chamber. Nothing moved in the shadows.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who’s there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A figure stepped from the darkness beyond his torchlight. Dark tan skin weathered by sun and wind. Braided black hair adorned with bone beads that clicked softly with each step. Chainmail over leather armor scored with old cuts. She moved like a warrior—fluid, controlled. <i>Dangerous</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An amulet hung at her throat. Amethyst set in dark metal, pulsing with strange light. The stone seemed to drink in the flickering flames, glowing from within.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her glaive came up in one smooth motion, the blade stopping a hair’s breadth from his throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor froze, his pulse going cold. She could have killed him already—struck from the darkness before he even knew she was there. The fact that he was still breathing meant something.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You could have killed me already,” he said, making a bid for time. He kept his voice steady despite the cold steel at his throat. His mind raced. An answer to his prayer—though not the god himself. A servant, perhaps? A deva? Or something worse. Whatever she was, she’d spared him for a reason. “You didn’t, though. Which means I’m worth more to you alive.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her lips curved. “A shrewd mind.” The blade traced slowly along his jaw as she circled. “Fit as well.” Her gaze swept over him, assessing. “Yes. In time, you will make a fine king.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The glaive continued its slow circuit. He held perfectly still, barely breathing. One wrong move and she could open his throat before he so much as blinked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stopped, eyes boring into his. Her face was young, but her gaze held the weight of centuries. “Perhaps…” The glaive withdrew slightly. “But you must make good on your promise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The words burst from him before he could think. “Anything!” His bleeding hand clenched into a fist. “I swear it. Whatever you ask—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her smile cut him short. She reached into a pouch at her belt and tossed something toward him. He caught it reflexively—an amulet, similar to hers, but deeper violet, encased in silver. The stone pulsed with warmth against his palm, beating in tandem with his heart.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This will grant you passage.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>His gaze flitted to the sealed doors behind the statue and then back to her. She nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What must I do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman’s smile turned cold. “Survive.” The torchlight flickered, and for just a heartbeat her shadow stretched wrong—too many limbs bending at unnatural angles.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor’s gaze dropped to the amulet in his palm. “What’s the catch?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No catch.” She paused at the edge of his torchlight, turning back. “The amulet will protect you. But only if you feed it. Blood for passage. Life for power. That is the bargain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whose blood?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Does it matter?” She gestured toward the sealed doors with a tilt of her head. “Prove yourself worthy of that title you seek, <i>King Among Kings</i>.” Her lips curved into something sharp and hungry. “Or die trying.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stepped backward into the fog. The darkness swallowed her whole, leaving only the fading click of bone beads.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor remained kneeling, blood still dripping from his palm, the violet amulet heavy in his hand. The carved statue loomed above—those stone eyes watching, waiting, judging.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The doors towered before him—smooth, and ancient. Beyond them lay greatness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The amulet thrummed in tune with his heart. “Blood for passage,” he whispered, gazing into its depths. “Life for power.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He clenched his bleeding hand around the pendant and stood. Blood was plentiful enough in this world. And if that was the price of power, he would pay it.</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span><i>The 35th of First Flows, Year 548 of the Common Era</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu stood with the rest of the group, gazing out into sheer darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What they found just beyond the ritual chamber defied belief. If that had been impossibly vast, this new cavern dwarfed it entirely. The passage opened onto a natural ledge overlooking an abyss that seemed to have no bottom. And covering everything—the walls, the floor, pooled in stagnant lakes—was a substance that made his skin crawl just to look at.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nightmarish goop seemed to move with a life of its own—a writhing mass of deep crimson shot through with veins of sickly purple. Even from a distance, just the sight of it filled him with an overwhelming sense of wrongness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra had ventured closer than the others to inspect the substance. As he drew near, his face went pale and he staggered back, one hand flying to his mouth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is that gunk?” Kellin asked, voice tight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nothing good,” Gazra replied hoarsely. “Best stay clear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Arlinkar tried to step closer for a better look, but only made it a few paces before doubling over with a retching sound. He stumbled back, face pale. The nearer anyone got, the worse it became—waves of nausea and revulsion rolling off the substance like heat from a forge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stay back,” Izu ordered. “Whatever it is, best not to take any chances.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Cursed, I’d wager,” Jedal muttered, spitting onto the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Over here,” Ryn called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu turned his attention away from the abyss. Ryn stood before a large enclosure recessed into the cliff face—a cave mouth perhaps five times the size of Kith’raxis’s bulk. Massive columns of dense metal flanked the entrance, each roughly eight inches in diameter and spaced two feet apart. They appeared to have been partially lowered from the ceiling, where obvious grooves scarred the stone, marking where the bars would slot into place. Three of the columns near the top were bent outward, twisted as if something immense had forced its way through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A holding pen?” Kellin suggested, studying the bent metal with narrowed eyes. “For Kith’raxis?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu stepped closer, examining the construction. Ancient Lightsworn work—the same impossibly precise craftsmanship he’d seen elsewhere. Built to contain Kith’raxis, clearly. Whatever mechanism had once held the bars in place had failed long ago, and something—or someone—had helped the beast escape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside the cave, past the damaged bars, the floor was littered with debris—bones, scattered equipment, the detritus of centuries. Izu slid past the bars and bent over to pick through the—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Over here, this way!” Ryn called again, voice urgent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu looked up from the debris. Kellin and Jedal met his gaze, curiosity overriding caution. Kellin shrugged, and the group shuffled across the uneven ground toward Ryn’s position.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Outside the cave, on the far left side of the ledge, an opening in the rock face led to another passage. Narrower than the main corridor, it curved around behind the holding pen. As they followed it deeper, the rough natural stone gave way to precise Lightsworn construction—smooth walls fitted together with uncanny perfection.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They followed Ryn through the passage in single file, emerging into what could only be a storeroom. Carved shelves lined the walls, most collapsed or empty. Broken containers littered the floor—assorted pottery, corroded metal boxes, things too degraded to identify.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And in the center, on a raised stone platform—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are those—” Ari’s voice caught.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silvery eggs. Six of them, arranged in two careful rows on a raised stone platform at the back of the cave. Featureless surfaces, cold and smooth, constructed from the same silver-colored metal as the transfabrulator. They rested in carved depressions, each one positioned with deliberate precision.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The party shuffled forward, gathering around the platform in stunned silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Six of them,” Koja breathed. Her voice caught. “One for each of us.” She reached toward the nearest egg, then jerked her hand back as if it had burned her. “That can’t be coincidence. Not after everything.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu said nothing. Six eggs. Six candidates—everyone except Arlinkar, who had already undergone his transformation. His gaze moved from one silver surface to the next. Maybe coincidence, maybe not. He’d seen enough since the Blight started—the timing, the locations, the people drawn together. It could be design. Purpose. If cosmic forces had set all this in motion, they might have been planning for a very long time. Or it could mean nothing at all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s just coincidence,” Kellin said, though her voice lacked conviction. She moved closer to Koja, placing a hand on the other woman’s shoulder. “The Lightsworn wouldn’t have known we’d be here. They couldn’t have.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence settled over the group like dust.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin stepped away and circled the platform slowly, her gaze sharp and calculating. “The real question is why they’re here at all.” She gestured at the eggs, then toward the passage they’d come from. “Lightsworn artifacts, hidden in a cave with that thing.” Her jaw tightened. “Why?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu stepped forward, studying one of the eggs without touching it. The silver surface reflected nothing—no light, no movement. Just smooth, empty metal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Security measure, maybe?” Jedal offered, rubbing at the healed-over stumps of his missing fingers. “Could be they used ol’ fiery boy to protect this place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shook his head. “I don’t think so. The Lightsworn captured Voidspawn—used them to test initiates.” His voice grew distant. “I faced creatures like that in the Spire.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Kith’raxis was far tougher than anything you described,” Ryn said quietly, arms crossed, gaze fixed on the eggs. “Those trials were meant to be survivable. That thing…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A low, rumbling chuckle cut through the chamber. All eyes turned to Gazra.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The massive Avanian uncrossed his arms. Tattoos crawled up his thick forearms—stylized horns and hooves that seemed to shift in the dim light. “They were hers,” he said, gesturing back to the holding pen. “The beast’s. It’s the only explanation that makes sense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu’s brow furrowed. He turned the idea over, gaze drifting back toward the passage they’d come from. The chamber where they’d fought Kith’raxis—the raised platform, the ancient architecture—the space had been designed for observation. “That would explain the ritual chamber,” he said slowly. “Could have been used for initiation ceremonies.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So what do we do with them?” Kellin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence fell over the group. Ari’s account of the Timeless Vault came to mind—the silvery egg Null had activated, the inscription from Avalia, the warnings of spiritual damage or death.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If we were to use them…” Ari spoke slowly, weighing each word. “One in five of you might not survive.” His gaze swept across the group—Ryn, Koja, Kellin, Jedal, Gazra, and Izu himself. Six faces, each bearing the exhaustion and grief of the battle earlier. “And we still have no idea how to get back out. The lift isn’t coming back down, and even if it did—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Gekkar,” Koja finished. She stepped forward, jaw set. “So here’s the plan: We all become Lightsworn, hide under the bone piles back in the ritual chamber, and ambush them when they come back down.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She’d started with conviction, but the absurdity caught up by the end. Her voice turned dry.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Easy,” she added. “We just survive the most agonizing experience of our lives, then sleep through a multi-day coma.” Her eyes cut to Ari. “You know, like he did.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The group exchanged uneasy glances before settling on Arlinkar.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari took a breath, arms crossing as his gaze drifted to the far wall. “Extremely painful at first,” he admitted. His hand rose to touch the three fragments of Spirit resting against his chest. “But nothing I couldn’t handle. I blacked out—visions, fever dreams…” A pause. “Woke up three days later feeling better than I ever had.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu turned the idea over. Koja’s sarcasm aside, it wasn’t the worst fallback—assuming they couldn’t find another way out. Six eggs. Six of them. The math was uncomfortable, but the alternative was dying in this forsaken darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal stepped forward with a crooked grin. “Well, if nobody else is jumping at the chance—” He spread his arms wide. “I <i>suppose</i> I’ll volunteer to become a demigod. If I have to. Since I have absolutely no other choice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra moved to stand beside him. The bone rings through his brow caught the light, sharpening his already brutal features. “Not letting you hog all the glory.” He sniffed and brushed the back of his hand against his nose. “We go together.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal’s grin faltered. His eyes slid toward Gazra—something uncertain flickering across his features before he caught himself and looked away. The massive Avanian didn’t seem to notice, but Izu did.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Glances passed between the others. Koja’s jaw tightened. Kellin’s expression went carefully neutral. Ryn stared at the floor.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Their minds are in two different places,</i> Izu thought. Jedal saw glory—a chance at power, at becoming something more. Gazra saw something else. Duty, perhaps. Or sacrifice. The kind of grim determination that came from expecting the worst and accepting it anyway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One in five wouldn’t survive. Both of them knew it. But only one of them seemed to care.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They didn’t have much choice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu drew a breath and made the call. “Null. Do it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The air shimmered. Null materialized from the aether, her featureless face tilting toward the group with that unsettling awareness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal and Gazra exchanged a look. No words. Just understanding. They moved to the platform together, each lifting an egg from its carved depression.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null drifted forward. Tendrils of void began to coil from her form—wispy strands of prismatic energy that reached toward the eggs. The silver surfaces started to glow. Faint at first, then brighter, pulsing with an inner luminescence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The eggs trembled in their hands, vibrating with increasing intensity. Cracks spider-webbed across the silver surfaces—thin at first, then widening as light bled through from within. The glow intensified until it was blinding.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then they exploded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silver fragments burst outward in a violent spray. But instead of scattering across the floor, the shards curved mid-flight—drawn toward Jedal and Gazra as if magnetized. Dozens of gleaming slivers struck their bodies, embedding deep into exposed skin. Arms, necks, faces—anywhere flesh was bare, the fragments found purchase, sinking in until only faint silver lines marked where they’d entered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra’s scream came first—a raw, guttural sound torn from somewhere primal. His massive frame seized, muscles locking rigid as veins of light crawled up his arms. His tattoos seemed to writhe, his skin rippling into shapes that shouldn’t exist.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Beside him, Jedal doubled over, teeth clenched so hard Izu could hear them grinding. Both men twisted and writhed, bodies contorting in ways that made Izu’s stomach lurch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra’s back arched. Something cracked—bone or spirit, he couldn’t tell. His mouth opened in a silent scream, eyes rolling back to show the whites. Then he went rigid—utterly still—before collapsing like a puppet with cut strings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal was still on his knees, pushing through. His face had gone pale, sweat streaming down his temples, every muscle trembling. Then his eyes snapped open—brilliant green and crackling with electricity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Get back!” Izu yelled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A bolt of lightning exploded from Jedal’s body, slamming into a cluster of ancient pottery against the far wall. Clay shattered. Dust billowed. The thunderclap echoed through the chamber, leaving their ears ringing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then Jedal slumped forward and lay still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dust settled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja rushed forward, dropping to her knees between the two men. Her hands found Jedal’s throat first—searching, pressing. “He’s alive,” she breathed. “Pulse is weak, but he’s alive.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned to Gazra. Her fingers touched his neck. Held there. Her face went still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked up at the group and shook her head. “He’s gone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The words hung in the silence. Izu moved to help her, and together they lifted Jedal’s unconscious form, carrying him to the far end of the chamber. They positioned him on his side—his breathing shallow but steady.</span>
<br><br>
<span>When Izu turned back, Kellin was already at the platform. Her eyes were red-rimmed, moisture she refused to let fall. She was shaken—they all were—but her jaw was set.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let’s just get it over with,” she said, voice rough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn nodded slowly and stepped forward. “Agreed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu looked to Ari. “Are you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll be fine,” Ari said quietly. His gaze moved to Gazra’s body, then away. “I’ll figure something out while you all recover.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn crossed to Koja, still kneeling near where Gazra had fallen. She took her hand and helped her rise, leading her back toward the platform. She moved like someone walking through a dream—present but not quite there.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin already had an egg in her hands, silver surface cold against her palms. Izu strode over and lifted one of the remaining eggs. Ryn and Koja each took one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They formed a loose circle around Null, eggs held before them like offerings. Four remaining. Four chances.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null’s featureless face regarded each of them in turn. “When you are ready.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu met the gazes of his companions—Kellin’s fierce determination, Ryn’s quiet resolve, Koja’s hollow grief. He turned back to Null.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let’s do this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null began to channel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Streams of void tendrils erupted from her form—dozens of them, writhing and coiling through the air like living darkness. They wrapped around the eggs, around their hands, around their arms. The silver surfaces blazed to life.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The eggs exploded. Fragments of silver embedded themselves in his skin, and pain shot through him like nothing he’d ever known. Every nerve ignited. Fire and ice and lightning all at once, coursing through his veins, rewriting him from the inside out. His bones screamed. His blood boiled. His very soul felt like it was being torn apart and remade.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everything went black.</span>

<br><br>
<span><i>The Day of Reckoning, Year 0 of the Ascendant Era.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor moved to the center of Mor Kharath’s chamber and drew a vial of black sand from his belt. He uncorked it and began to pour, letting the grains fall in a thin, precise line.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>A circle, first. Then the inner geometries—lines intersecting at precise angles, sigils at each convergence point. The pattern took shape beneath his hands, ancient and purposeful. A binding ritual older than the Lightsworn who had built this temple, lost to all but those who studied the Old Ways. Knowledge bestowed to him by the witches of the coven, purchased with promises he intended to keep.</span>
<br><br>
<span>When the final line was drawn, he stepped back and drew the Sword of Kings from its sheath. The ancient blade sang in his hands, its edge dark as night and humming with latent power. He tilted it, catching the dim light. Something moved in the polished surface—not his reflection, but something <i>beneath</i>. A shadow coiling in the depths. Molten eyes flashed and vanished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He reversed his grip and drove the blade into the earth. It sank deep—through sand, through stone, through the bedrock of reality itself. The sword shuddered in his hands as veins of shadow spread outward from the point of impact, crawling along the geometric lines like roots. Where they met the circle’s edge, the black sand ignited with an eldritch light that strained against the darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wind whipped up from nowhere, tearing at his hair and cloak. The air shrieked. Dozens of half-formed whispers rose around him—layering, overlapping, building into a cacophony that turned his stomach and made his skin crawl. They merged, coalescing into something singular and unnatural. One voice. Many mouths. Utterances that no mortal was meant to hear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor stepped back and raised his hand. The Sanctern of Will responded—a steady glow accompanied by a faint hum that resonated through his bones. The shadow tendrils withdrew to hang loosely around the blade, no longer straining against the binding circle. The voices ceased.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence. Perfect stillness. Absolute emptiness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then something stirred within the ritual’s depths—a presence ancient and terrible. The raw essence of Mor Kharath, stripped of form and avatar, pressed against the binding’s boundaries.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>“Time,”</i> the voice pleaded. The words scraped across his mind like claws on glass. <i>“Grant me more time, and I will give you—”</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor laughed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Slow at first—a single chuckle that escaped before he could stop it. Then it grew, gathering vigor until his laughter echoed through the chamber, bouncing off ancient walls and filling the vast space with pure, unbridled elation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did not think he would get this far.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nearly three decades of preparation—machinations and training, rising to prominence, countless battles fought and won. Allies gained and lost. Betrayal. Exile. Triumph. An empire forged through blood and will. And now, at last, the demon who had haunted his dreams since boyhood—the scourge of his people—lay bound before him. Helpless. Desperate. <i>Begging</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The false sky above pulsed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor’s laughter died in his throat. Above him, the sourceless light shifted—clouds that had never existed forming, swirling, and parting as though pushed aside by an unseen presence. And through the gaps, something watched.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His heart skipped. His breath caught. But would not falter—not now, not when he'd come this far. He lifted his gaze to meet those watching eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you watching? Good.” His voice rang clear and strong. “The word you are looking for is <i>ꡌꡘꡌꡠꡯꡪꡘꡪ</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had been waiting to say that his entire life. He relished the moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something stirred within him, then. Power, ancient and terrible, responding to his call. The fragments of Will blazed against his hand—seven points of silver light forming an almost-complete spiral teardrop.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His mind drifted to that underground chamber, all those years ago. The statue with its six arms. Flames carved from obsidian. A serpent coiling behind a figure of terrible beauty. He remembered kneeling before it as a desperate boy—blood dripping into the basin, swearing oaths he barely understood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In time, he had come to understand the truth. The statue depicted no god, but a pretender—a mortal who had claimed six pieces of Vaka’s power and called himself divine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor now held <i>seven</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seven fragments, and he had already brought the Realm to its knees. Two hundred thousand soldiers camped beyond these walls—the greatest host ever assembled under a single banner.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His gaze lifted to meet those watching eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am, myself, worth two out of nine parts of the Goddess of Will.” His voice swelled with power, each word resonating with the force of absolute conviction. “I am the Successor to Shūen. I am Azahndor, King Among Kings, and god among men.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He clenched his fist, turning his attention to Mor Kharath.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>“I am your undoing.”</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Raw power surged at his command. Voidshimmer snaked and coalesced around his hand as his own power built—red and violet and shadow and void-chroma, arcing electricity crackling around his fist. The air screamed as reality bent to his will.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b></b><i>“ꡨꡌꡠꡘꡒꡛꡠ-ꡫꡊ: ꡪꡌꡡꡌꡠꡘ!”</i></b></span>
<br><br>
<span>A wave of annihilation tore through the dome, shockwaves rippling outward in concentric rings of devastation. The four great pillars shattered, fragments of stone hanging suspended in the air. Fissures raced through the false sky, and reality itself tore at the seams as the binding circle collapsed inward—then detonated in a final, thunderous release that turned the entire chamber to glass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Dark God of the Akhari was obliterated in an instant.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Two weeks later…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla opened her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Reality rushed back in—weight, warmth, the ache of a body she’d almost forgotten. Her mind strained against memories of memories that slipped away like water through her fingers, leaving only impressions of vastness and eternity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Two figures stood before her. Ari—familiar, grounding. But beside him…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dark-haired Akhari man from her fever-dreams. Broad-shouldered. Regal. Amber eyes burning with quiet intensity. The same piercing gaze that had violated her soul beneath a blood-red moon. The same face that had watched her from the edge of her bed, calling her <i>my love</i> with tenderness and longing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Azahndor.</span>
<br><br>
