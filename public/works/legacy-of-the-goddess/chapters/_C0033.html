<span>“Wolfos? <i>A talking wolfos?</i>” Zelda asked incredulously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know. Crazy, right?” said Link’s voice, through Fi. “We didn’t exactly have a polite conversation though. I don’t think he cared much for talking.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head in disbelief, looking to Laylith for support.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith shrugged. “It had to be the shard, right?” she suggested. “I can’t imagine there’s more out there like him.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No idea,” Link said. “If there is anything special about it, I haven’t noticed anything. Not yet, anyway. It’s only been a couple hours. Actually, I wanted to ask you about that when you’re not busy. I guess we can test stuff later?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Later, yes.” Zelda frowned. “Are you okay to keep going?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, surprisingly enough,” Link said. “Not a scratch on me. Well, except for my feet. They’re pretty scraped up. Nothing some Healing won’t fix.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How long?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh… good question. Hey Koja, how long will it take to Heal?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A day or two,” came Koja’s voice. “But you heal faster than normal, so I dunno.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A day or two,” Link repeated. “But I heal faster than normal, so…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Erm, yes, we heard her,” Zelda said, talking over him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, right.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a little awkward talking this way—whichever side had Fi’s avatar with them had to have their words transmitted telepathically to a single point of contact on the other side. Zelda wondered if that could be improved. Fi could only manifest a single avatar at a time, but was it really necessary to manifest an avatar if she was just transmitting voices?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Coming a-port!” she heard someone yell, muffled though it was through the cabin walls.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grimaced and braced herself. The boat tilted and wobbled, and she clung to a wooden beam for support. A pang of nausea as the apparent direction of gravity shifted a few degrees and back again, but she managed to hold it down this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Goddesses, she hated boats.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Ships. Whatever.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” she said after a moment to collect her thoughts. “Thanks for the update, Link. Take care of yourself, be careful, and keep me apprised of any developments.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Will do,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“End communications, Fi,” Zelda said. Fi relaxed and bowed her head. “—And one question before you go: Do you think you could improve this method of communication? Just for transmitting voices, I mean. Both ways.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi’s hues shifted as she adopted a pensive look. Zelda always boggled at how she managed to convey so much information through her body language, despite the fact that her face was unmoving and she had no arms. “Trivially, I could manifest an Ethereal Avatar at each location for each round of correspondence,” Fi said. “However, I suspect that is not what you had in mind, as the cost of doing so for extended communications would quickly exceed our available budget.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded impatiently. “Yes. Ideally without manifesting an avatar if possible.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi gave a nod. “I would like to note that below a certain threshold, doing the same with Intangible Avatar would incur less cost than the current method, with the stipulation that only individuals carrying Hylia’s mark would be able to hear me. Besides that, I am capable of attenuating messages I send to mimic the voice of the speaker; however, it will take practice to do so fluently. Also I should note that sending messages via telepathy quickly exceeds the cost of manifesting even an Intangible avatar, and I know of no mechanism to broadcast messages to multiple recipients. The cost of doing as I infer you request will scale with a constant multiple of the number of conversational participants.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly as she digested the information. “So you can do it, it will just take some practice, and might be expensive?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That is an adequate conclusion to draw, Mistress,” Fi said with a pirouette.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And any chance of reducing the cost with more research? Or figuring out another method?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncertain,” Fi said, going from pink and blue to purple and teal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed. They would need a budget to figure out the research budget, as per usual. She’d need to check how much they could afford for it. Later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, Fi. Thank you,” Zelda said. “I will consider and get back to you. That’s all for now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is my pleasure, Mistress,” Fi said as her physical avatar departed from the realm, leaving her alone in the small cabin with Laylith.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Awkward tension. She—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was that all? Or… did you want to talk about something else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grimaced. Best just get it over with. “It’s been a while,” she said. “Since we last spoke privately, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’ve been busy,” Laylith said. “It’s okay. I understand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Emotions. Zelda stood and paced, but there wasn’t much room to move about in the private cabin. She stumbled but managed to keep her footing as the boat lurched to a halt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The peculiarities of her relationship with Laylith were unsettling to think about. Was she merely another advisor in the employ of the Crown, or something more? It felt like more of the latter. A lot more of the latter. And yet…</span>
<br><br>
<span>While they had had a few moments of genuine connection—and Zelda was immensely grateful for the older woman’s support—thinking about how she had all but neglected Laylith these past few weeks turned her stomach. And now here she was, seeking more advice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She didn’t want to be that kind of person. It would be easier if it was just professional. Why couldn’t things just be easy?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Something bothering you?” Laylith said sweetly. “You know I’m always here if you need to talk.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know, Laylith, and I appreciate you,” Zelda said, her face turned away to hide her eyes. “I just… I wanted you to know that. There are so few people I can trust, and even fewer I can confide in. Goddesses, I’ve already said that, haven’t I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not in so many words,” Laylith said, a smile apparent in her voice. “…Dearie, would you like a hug?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That would be nice,” Zelda said with a long, calming breath that let her find her center. “But not now. I can’t afford to be soft and sentimental when I’m scheduled to meet with the treasonous bastard-in-chief in a few minutes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith smirked. “Advice, then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, please,” Zelda said as she sat at her writing desk and dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief before getting to work adjusting her makeup in the mirror.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I could be missing the mark,” Laylith said, hedging her words. “And if so, please tell me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” Zelda said, mentally bracing herself for the worst. “Go ahead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, it seems somewhat obvious to me that you have unresolved feelings about Vesyrn’s role in your father’s affliction. I imagine most people in your position would be justifiably angry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Zelda said, barely above a whisper. She dug her nails into her palms. “That’s putting it mildly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And yet, you have decided he is too valuable to punish. That you must pardon him and work with him, for the good of the kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not sure I ever explicitly made that decision,” Zelda said. “But yes, it’s not like I have other options.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We always have other options, Zelda. It’s just that every option has costs, and some costs we are unwilling to pay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda set down the brush and stared straight ahead. “What is it you’re saying?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m saying that you are the Queen. And that it is within your power to do with Vesyrn as you see fit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t help!” Zelda glared back at her, agast. Laylith eyed her impassively. “I can’t… He’s <i>Shesan’s</i> agent! Everything he’s done has been at her behest. I can’t punish him and still pretend… I can’t… I mean, she’s—<i>Arrg!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda threw a small tub of powder across the cabin, leaving a mark on the far wall as a cloud of dust settled on the floor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You can’t, what?” Laylith pressed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t… forgive her either,” Zelda said weakly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But, what? You want to? You feel like you have to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mother Above, she had never felt so conflicted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know,” Zelda said, deflating. She set her head on the desk. “I don’t know what to do. I’m at a loss. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to think. I feel like my own thoughts betray me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm.” Laylith crossed her arms. “It’s a monumental burden you carry, Zelda. When in such binds, what we feel can often be at odds, and it can be difficult to separate ourselves from personal context. What’s worse, when we are angry, it clouds our judgment.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, feeling drained. “Yeah. I know. Impa always said things like that too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what would Impa advise you to do about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled and dabbed at her eyes, careful to keep from smearing her freshly applied makeup all over again. “She’d tell me to listen to my feelings. And then probably something like ‘Trust in Nayru’s Wisdom to guide you.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Laylith prodded. “What are your feelings telling you? What is it you think Nayru guides you to do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She snorted. “Well, supposing that makes sense to consider… I suppose… That while I have every right to be angry, it is a poor Queen that puts her own thirst for vengeance above the needs of her people.” She felt a palpable distaste in her mouth as she said the words. “And that, while I don’t have to forgive either of them for their crimes…” A heavy sigh. “I’m still grateful for their aid. One need not cancel the other. Also, I must again remind myself that we do not have the <i>luxury</i> of choosing our allies in this fight. Gods be damned.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith gave her a bemused smile. “That’s one way to put it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I still can’t trust him,” Zelda snapped. “Either of them. That’s the worst part. Shesan’s always chiding me for being so suspicious, but how can I not be? On one hand, how much more could I ask of her to prove herself? On the other—putting aside for a moment that she poisoned my father and may or may not have been responsible for his death—we both know she’ll do anything as long as she thinks it’s justified.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you talked with her about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How could I talk with her about it?! How do you imagine that conversation would go? ‘Hello Shesan, I just wanted to tell you to your unconscionably pretty face that I hate your ficking guts and I’ll never forgive you.’ Something like that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘Unconscionably pretty?’” Laylith said with a pointed eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda groaned. “Not like that. I didn’t mean it like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm,” Laylith said noncommittally. “Well—setting that aside for now—what I meant was, I think it would be a good idea to have an honest discussion with her about trust, and why you find it so difficult.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed her. “You really think that would work?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan is nothing if not practical,” Laylith said. “So yes, I do think she will recognize the merits of—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A knock at the door. Zelda froze and felt the blood drain from her face. The ship wasn’t that big, and she hadn’t been particularly careful to keep her voice down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith stood to answer it. Thankfully, it was just a random soldier.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pardon, Lady Sheikah. Your Grace,” the man said with reverent nods. “We’ve docked, and the Sheikah party is ready to meet with you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you…” Zelda studied his face. “Gerdy, isn’t it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>His face lit up, and he bowed low. “It is, Your Grace! I am honored to be of service.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed and gave a thin smile. “Thank you, soldier. Please, tell our guests I will be with them shortly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command!” The soldier gave a salute and departed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith glanced back to her with a consolatory look as she closed the door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A long, low groan. “I don’t think I’m ready for this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It will be okay,” Laylith reassured her. “I have faith in you. You usually rise to the occasion.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Above deck, Zelda got her first sight of Holdensford, a logistics hub near the Fork. The small town was situated at the edge of a lake off the eastern branch of the River Hylia—merely a day’s ride from Hateno.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hateno. It had been one of the first settlements to fall in the wake of the Blight, and would need to be prioritized for reconstruction to ensure the stability of Talus. No doubt Taetus was already on the ball, but Zelda made a mental note to follow up just in case.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even as the sun began to set, Holdensford was a veritable aracha nest, bustling with activity. Every port at the dockyard was occupied, with workers and soldiers busy ferrying cargo to and fro. The walls of the small town were lined with troops, and a company of militia and fresh recruits were hard at work doing training drills and sparring in the town square.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were uncomfortably close to the front. Two and a half days to Talus as the guay flew, and the countryside from here to there was far from secure. She’d be sleeping on the boat overnight—easier to secure that way. In the morning they’d ride to Lurelin with a heavy escort, then ferry across the river to Havensport. From there, just a short jaunt back to Castletown.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She tapped her chin. It was a frustration of hers that travel upriver was so much slower than it needed to be. It could be done at a reasonable pace with two dozen strong men taking rotation on the oars with a smaller boat, but that method of travel was reserved only for priority shipments upstream. She had been meaning for the longest time to test out some designs for a mechanized boat that used oxgoats to turn a shaft and gearworks to translate the rotation to paddling, but it hadn’t ever been a priority. Perhaps that could be revisited soon?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Near the dock, Zelda spied Allanah turning over a lockbox to a group of three monks wearing light blue cloaks. The Seekers that had traveled behind them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Curious. It was just her and Vesyrn. “Wasn’t there a third?” Zelda asked, turning to Laylith. “Ahiran, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Healer,” Laylith said, as if that explained it. Zelda gave her a questioning look. “Needed at Talus,” she elaborated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, right,” Zelda said. That did in fact explain it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello again, Zelda,” Shesan said in passing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan.” Zelda nodded to her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned to the sunset over the river. “Nice view. Unconscionably pretty, wouldn’t you say?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s face went beet red.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, Vesyrn had just boarded the ship, followed closely behind by Allanah. Cove gave a nervous salute, but dropped it quickly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn regarded the boy. The tall, burly man towered over him. “Cove! Queen’s personal guard, hm? You’ve done well for yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you. Vesyrn. …Sir,” Cove said uneasily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ugh. Zelda had been dreading this for too long. She drew tall and walked past Shesan to meet the man. Vesyrn knelt as she approached, presenting her with his prize. Two spiral earrings made of silver, encasing golden fragments of Wisdom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She frowned. They felt heavy. Uncomfortable to wear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She opted to clasp them to her necklace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Last time we met, Your Grace—” Vesyrn started.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda didn’t wait for him to finish. She backhanded him. Hard.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Damnation,</i> that stung. She massaged her hand, but tried not to show pain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I deserved that,” Vesyrn said, wiping blood from his lip.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, you deserve far worse,” Zelda corrected. “Luckily for you, I still need your expertise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn regarded her cooly. “My Queen… My allegiance is and has always been to the realm. On my life, I swear it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda seethed. “Get yourself situated,” she said. “Then meet me below deck. We’re going to have a chat.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked over his shoulder to the lithe, blonde woman she had only seen on a handful of occasions. “Well met, Allanah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’ve all grown up, Your Grace,” Allanah said with a smile and a curtsy. She wobbled a bit, as Zelda was oft to do in her youth. That earned her a grin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please join us,” Zelda said. “I want to hear your perspective too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Laylith, Cove, Shesan, you too. Captain, please see to it that we are not bothered.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command, Your Grace!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Fortunately it was much less cramped below deck with the crew cleared out. The six of them sat around a pair of square tables at the center of the open space.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Explain yourself,” Zelda commanded as Vesyrn took his seat. “Start from the beginning.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn folded his hands in his lap as he set one leg over the other, eyes fixed on the table before him. “Your Grace, what do you remember of your father’s dealings with the Gerudo?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not much.” Zelda shook her head, her eyes unfocusing as she recalled some painful memories. “Around the time Ganondorf was deposed, banditry and incursions from the southern border became a problem. A few skirmishes later, and Father came down hard, all but declaring war as he deployed forces to restore law and order to the region. His… harsh handling of the situation quickly put an end to the banditry, though it effectively ended trade and all relations between our peoples.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn turned questioningly to Shesan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She’s spoken to Naibi,” Shesan said. “Gotten her perspective, tried to fill in the gaps on her own. I haven’t told her. I’m pretty sure no one has.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s blood went cold. “Told me <i>what</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She felt a hand on her shoulder. Laylith. She squeezed lightly. Zelda met her eyes. Her expression read ‘patience.’</span>
<br><br>
<span>Alright. Fair enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn cleared his throat and scratched his beard. “Allow me to rephrase. What do you remember <i>personally</i> from that time? Though I suppose you were but a child, so perhaps—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I was thirteen. Hardly a child.” Zelda corrected. She sighed irritably. “I remember being reprimanded at Court. Father demanded I sit in on meetings with the war council, but refused to hear my perspective. Disobeying his instruction, I called him out for his barbaric tactics and was severely rebuked for it in front of everyone. I’m sorry—what does my personal involvement have to do with anything?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not all that much, I suppose,” Vesyrn said. “I was simply wondering where to start and how much detail I needed to go into. As you say, you were quite outspoken at the time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your willingness to publicly oppose your father is what first drew my attention to you, Zelda,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blinked. Was she suggesting…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I may, Your Grace?” Allanah.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Go ahead,” Zelda said, turning her attention.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe what Vesyrn is probing for is… Do you remember the Gerudo dignitaries your father met with? Lord Dragmire and his attendants? Ladies Kuma, Ila, Fassee? You spent some time with Ila in the library with Sage Amaurath, under strict supervision.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda tried her best to recall those events, but she was drawing a blank. She started to shake her head, but then the memories came flooding back. “Oh. Yes, I… uhm.” Ugh. It was embarrassing to look back on. “I told Father I didn’t trust them. Urged him to send them away. When he asked me why, I said that the man had evil eyes and the women laughed too much.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You weren’t wrong,” Shesan said. “None in Hyrule knew it at the time, but that man was none other than Ganondorf.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not exactly a clever deception. Or a necessary one, I would guess,” Laylith said, echoing Zelda’s thoughts. “To what end?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To gain a private audience with the King under false pretenses,” Vesyrn said. “King Gaillard never would have agreed to his proposal had he not met in person, and if he had presented himself as the Gerudo High King, it would have aroused suspicion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not to mention, it would have been a very different visit,” Allanah added.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Agreed to his proposal?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ganondorf came to your father with an offer,” Shesan said. “Work with him and eventually unite your peoples under one banner. Afterwards, they would duel, and the victor would rule over both kingdoms.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? That’s absurd. Why would my father agree to that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suspect trickery and foul play,” Shesan said. “Keep in mind, Ganondorf is an agent of Demise. Who knows? What matters is that your father came away from that meeting absolutely convinced that it was Hylia’s will that he battle Ganondorf to the death for the fate of this realm. He became obsessed with hunting down ancient texts. Anything that could be interpreted as ‘prophecy’ to support his vision. He told no one of his aims, not even his advisors, and began to work in secret to coordinate with—and to subvert the enemy king. Ganondorf would not have learned the location of the three fragments of Power in the Plains of Ruin except by your father’s well intentioned but ultimately foolish actions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re saying he caused the Blight,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Caused?” Shesan shook her head, unconvinced. “Would it have played out as it did but for him? Most likely not. His actions considerably accelerated the time frame, though.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pondered this. It was hard to believe Father would be so daft—but then again, it was just like him to get some idea in his head like that and refuse to let go. Headstrong to a fault.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A trait she sometimes shared, she’d admit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She frowned. “If he didn’t tell anyone, how did you find out?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Naturally, I intercepted their correspondence,” Vesyrn said, sounding full of himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Naturally?</i>” Zelda could scarcely believe his gall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man smirked as he glanced over to Allanah and back. “A question, if I may: Who is it you think runs this kingdom, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scoffed as she leaned back in her seat. “Need I remind you that I have not yet issued your pardon, Vesyrn? What are you suggesting?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am not <i>suggesting</i> anything,” he said, unrelenting. Unmoved. “I am simply asking questions, to which I am certain you already know the answers. Who is it that whispers into the ear of every leader—including the monarch—offering sagacious advice and wise counsel on every single matter of import? Who is it that gathers, directs, and controls the flow of information throughout the kingdom? Who is it that—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>I get it</i>, you smug ficking bastard!” Zelda said. “You’re saying that, practically speaking, the Sheikah run the kingdom from the shadows. And that not only are you unrepentant for your crimes, but you think this whole thing is a farce and you want me to know that you know my hand is forced. That about sum it up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vian knew about the plot too, Your Grace,” Allanah said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda glared at her. “<i>What.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She knew the whole time. Signed off on it, in fact,” Allanah continued. “I learned it from her just before the siege, when I confronted her about Vesyrn’s actions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And where is she now?” Zelda asked. If Vian was still alive, then perhaps…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dead,” Allanah answered. “I killed her, at her command. And then left to search the ruins of the Old Kingdom. After faking my own death—again, at her command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>She is sincere, Mistress.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Why?</i>” was all Zelda could think to ask.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Allanah shook her head and gestured with an upturned palm. “All she would tell me was that the fate of the kingdom rested in my hands. I can only surmise that she was desperate to keep the plot from coming to light. I believed she hoped Impa would deal with Vesyrn, and failing that, that he would be killed or exiled.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>How deep did this betrayal run? How complex were these schemes? And how long had they been at this game?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is there anything else I need to know?” Zelda said in resignation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The table was silent for a good moment. “Well?” Vesyrn said. “Do you want to tell her, or should I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll do it,” Allanah said. “Your Grace… The skirmishes at the border. They were false flag operations. The insurrections and subsequent rebellion under Ganondorf’s regime were likewise orchestrated by us. We worked tirelessly to sabotage your father’s aims—Vian ordered it at Vesyrn’s insistence. Though, we did not know at the time that Vesyrn had been compromised by a foreign agent.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘Compromised by a foreign—’” Vesyrn laughed. “Would you listen to yourself? This woman is and has been the only chance we have at survival. We all know it!” He slammed a fist on the table. “And do you think I kept anything from Vian? I reported everything to her. Everything!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That does not change the oath you swore, Vesyrn,” Allanah said. “It is our <i>duty</i> to ensure peace and maintain stability, even when—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—It is our <i>right</i> as the dutiful heirs of Hylia to intercede when the Crown errs!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked between them, mouth agape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is my understanding,” Shesan said hesitantly, “that this ideological schism has existed in one form or another within the Sheikah ranks… Well, since the beginning.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith shifted beside her. “For the record, I always sided with Allanah on this one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s mind wasn’t working. She turned to Cove.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shrugged. “I try to stay out of politics. That’s for the higher ups.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She massaged her forehead. This… this was insane. The Sheikah…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” she said, desperate to get a hold on her thoughts. “So… the poisoning of my father. Was that—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—That was my idea,” Shesan said. “As I…” A sharp breath. “As I attempted to say before, when you first questioned me: there was an antidote. It was <i>safe</i>. As safe as could be, given the circumstances. It was a desperate move, and believe me I tried much else. But he would not so much as grant me an audience, and refused to listen to the counsel of his Sheikah advisors. It was our hope that you… would be more amenable to reason when you took up the crown. Or at the very least, would be less eager to act as an unwitting pawn of the enemy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>So you wanted to use me as your pawn instead</i>, Zelda thought. “And his death?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn spoke. “A Sheikah squadron was dispatched to his defense when it was apparent the castle was under assault by enemy forces. I got there first, and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—To steal his fragment of Power after assaulting me in the infirmary,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn eyed her. Zelda eyed him right back. “Say it,” she commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I got there first <i>to steal his fragment of Power after assaulting you in the infirmary</i>,” he continued, “and Impa arrived shortly thereafter. The squadron engaged the transformed Impa when they saw she was attacking me, and critically wounded her before failing their objective and being forced to retreat.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Failing their objective,” Zelda repeated. Abstract. Dry. Spoken like a true soldier.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, well. Regrettably, the assassins were successful. I understand they attacked you as well, Your Grace. Near simultaneously. By providence alone, they did not succeed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded numbly. He wasn’t wrong. “Who were they?” she asked. “The Sheikah that attacked her. Do we know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you sure you want to know?” Laylith.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned to her. Her voice wavered. “It… it wasn’t you, was it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shook her head softly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Relief. “Then yes. Tell me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tela. Graela. Darrek. Gazra. Koja,” Vesyrn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Those first two, actually—uhm…” Cove interjected, clearing his throat. “Official status: deceased.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Cove,” Zelda said, feeling languid and tired beyond all belief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She felt disgusted with herself. Zelda considered Koja a friend. She had even been with her on occasion. She didn’t <i>want</i> to blame the woman—given the account, she was only following reasonable orders, and it was likely she didn’t even know who she was fighting. Still…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She found herself ruminating on an old thought—a painful one. One she thought she had put well behind her. What might have transpired that fateful day had Hylia instead sent her to Impa’s aid instead of Link’s? Even now, knowing all she did, she still found it hard to accept that her family’s deaths were necessary for the greater good.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you alright, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda snapped to. She turned to Laylith and saw pain in her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She gave a perfunctory nod. “I have much to think about. I think… I think I would like to be left alone for a while.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well, Your Grace,” Vesyrn said, standing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, Your Grace.” Allanah.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith gave her a gentle pat on the shoulder as she stood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait.” Zelda motioned to Vesyrn. “One more thing. As a condition for your pardon…” She huffed. As if she could rightly impose such a condition. “I want a list of all the Sheikah agents that were complicit in your schemes. For my own peace of mind, if nothing else. And as discussed, you are still to make a public apology in front of the temple in Castletown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Complicit,” Vesyrn said. He frowned. “Would you mind—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Those who acted with knowledge that they did so to aid you in deposing my father,” Zelda clarified.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, Your Grace,” Vesyrn said with a nod. “That would be a short list.” He searched about for a quill and wrote down a list of names. Zelda waited patiently, then took it when he finished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded as she read them. Seven in total, three among the casualty reports. As expected, they had been overly conservative in their handling of the situation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Only one name stood out to her. “Malg.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Malg, yes,” Vesyrn said. “I wasn’t certain I had gotten through to him, but on at least one occasion, he conveniently failed to forward information at an opportune time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda muttered a curse under her breath. “Thank you. Now leave me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shuffling of chairs as everyone made to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ugh. Where was her mind today?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not you,” Zelda said, pointing to Shesan. “We still have more to discuss.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” Shesan said, opting to remain standing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waited for the room to clear and the door to shut. “I have the fragments,” she said. “Now what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now… we wait.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For me to bond them? For the changes to take hold?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded. “As I said before, the particular effects of the realignment are hard to predict. It might happen before you sleep, or as you dream tonight. I can’t say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” Zelda said, feeling unsure. “Anything I can do to prepare?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shook her head and shrugged. “Try to relax?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks,” Zelda said sardonically. “I’ll take it under advisement.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan crossed her arms. “Anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was, but she didn’t want to talk about it. Zelda thought back to her conversation with Laylith. She blushed again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She felt so stupid. Foolish. Just a silly girl, pretending to be a queen.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Whatever. Best to get it over with.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know what you overheard, but Laylith seems to think I should talk to you about trust. Or more pointedly, about why I can’t trust you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan softened as she set one hand on her hip. What was that look? If she didn’t know any better, she would have thought it was sympathy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I get it, Zelda, I do,” Shesan said. “You’re learning that you’ve been caught up in schemes that have affected every facet of your life since before you can remember. You want nothing more than to find solid footing again—for things to be ‘normal’ again, if they ever were. It’s overwhelming. You try to shut it out and keep moving, but damn near every time you find yourself alone you start thinking. What could you have done differently if you knew then what you do now? What could you have done differently <i>then</i>, if only you had been more resolved, more determined? You can’t help yourself. It gnaws at you, constantly, and there’s never any relief.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s… yeah,” Zelda said quietly. Since when was Shesan relatable?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Shesan said. “For what it’s worth, if I could go back and do it again, I would treat you as… more of an equal. From the start. I’m not sure that would’ve helped you feel any better in the counterfactual, but you deserve that much.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘More of?’” Zelda asked skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan cleared her throat. “Well. You were a child when you first came to my attention. It hasn’t been until <i>very recently</i> that you’ve grown into yourself.” The woman looked her over. “But you’re clever, and you learn quickly. You know when to take charge, and when to delegate. You’re creative. Insightful and inquisitive, if somewhat naive. Idealistic, yet pragmatic—or you try to be, anyway. Dutiful. Shortsighted, I suppose, but you’re still young. I can’t say it’s been a pleasure given the circumstances, but I don’t dislike you, nor do I hate working with you, even if I might give that impression sometimes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wow, okay. Bit of a mixed bag there. Zelda shook her head slowly. “Thanks, I guess?” She smirked. “And I suppose you’re nothing if not a brutally honest, judgmental, snarky bitch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan laughed at that, genuine mirth in her eyes. “Thanks. I try.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda boggled at her. That wasn’t… wasn’t fully intended as a compliment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sharp as a hammer.” Shesan offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry, what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s what a friend of mine used to say about me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took her a moment. “Oh. Hah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan started to say something else, but stopped short. Zelda studied her. She knew that look. She knew it all too well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry. My condolences.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cocked her head. “So what changed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pardon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She crossed her arms. “Don’t play dumb. Usually getting the time of day from you is an ordeal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan grunted, then turned and sat on a padded bench by a small circular window. She sat forward, then shifted and turned, crossing her legs and rubbing her brow. “I suppose I’ve finally resigned myself to the fact that I’m never getting back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You still think we’re going to lose?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan gave her a look before rolling her eyes and waving it away. She peered out the window. A fish swam by. “The plan’s a good one,” she said. “You still have a shot. I don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You… what?” Zelda said, stunned. “Are you… Does the plan require you to sacrifice yourself?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh. Nothing so dramatic,” Shesan said. “But to be honest… Until recently I held out hope that I would be able to jump ship at the last minute, so to speak, even if your world was doomed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said. Somehow that didn’t surprise her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Wait, ‘was doomed?’” she said as the thought caught up to her. “You said ‘was.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, did I?” Shesan with a feigned laugh. “Sometimes people misspeak.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh huh,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A question burned in her mind. She considered for a moment whether it was okay to ask here, and figured she might as well go for it. “Is it your choice to go through with it? Can you say that much?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We always have choices, Zelda,” Shesan said, completely deadpan. “It’s just that every choice has a cost, and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Okay!” Zelda said, flustered. “I get it. Can we stop dancing around this? You spied on my private conversation with Laylith. Weren’t we just talking about trust? How is this… how can you expect me to…” She couldn’t even finish the sentence. So many implications. So many problems. She didn’t know where to start.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan studied her—expression unreadable—then simply shrugged. “I’m not omniscient, Zelda. But I do make it a point to know everything I can. Can’t afford not to. Sometimes that overlaps with personal matters. An unavoidable hazard of the job, really.” She leaned forward conspiratorially, drawing a leg up and resting her head on one knee. “And yes, that means I know you hate me, and are probably plotting in secret what to do with me once I’ve outlived my usefulness. And yes, that means I know you still think I’m pretty and that you can’t help but fantasize about me in your dreams.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… what?! I never said—” <i>No.</i> Her face went pale as she recalled Shesan sitting in her study, reading her diary. “Wait, I didn’t write that either…” She paused and tilted her head. “<i>Augh, you…!</i>” Her eyes went wide as she glared daggers and bunched her fists, failing miserably at maintaining any semblance of composure. She tried not to laugh. Tried not to scream. What she managed was a toothy grin that was equal parts contempt and admiration.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan winked. “Don’t worry. Your secrets are safe with me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gaped at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh come off it,” Shesan said. “You’re not a threat to me, nor I to you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… what? That doesn’t… you can’t just…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan raised an eyebrow and gave her the smuggest of grins. “Can’t I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>She is sincere, Mistress.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Unbelievable.</i>” Zelda pointed towards the door to the stairs. “Out. Now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan sat up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Wait.” Zelda groaned. She wasn’t about to let her get away with that misdirection. “You never answered my question,” she said. “I need to know. What’s stopping you from jumping ship now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan leaned back. “Integrity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed her dubiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What, you want to question that one too?” Shesan said sarcastically. “Please. It’s all I have left.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, let me get this straight,” Zelda said, waving a hand. “You plot and scheme for… a decade, at least?” She waved her hand more fervently as if to brush the thought aside. “And okay, I can separate myself from it enough to see the bigger picture and appreciate why and what you hoped to accomplish. But by your own admission you are in the business of espionage and subversion. How do you square any of that with <i>integrity</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Means to an end,” Shesan said matter-of-factly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waited a tense moment before pressing. “The end being? You know, you never told me why you’re here. Why you care. And don’t act like you don’t—I know you do. What’s your stake in this? Shesan, please. If you would just <i>tell me</i>…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan met her eyes. Where just a moment ago there was playful mirth, now there was only coldness. Emptiness. It was unnerving. She felt taken aback.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda. I am doing all I can…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A long pause. Zelda waited on bated breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…to keep the darkness at bay. Just a bit longer. To buy us time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda perked up. “Time for what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You clever idiot.” Shesan shook her head and looked away. “Not time <i>for</i>. Just time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blinked. She understood at once. Shesan really did view their fight as hopeless, didn’t she? Their fates as inevitable. And yet…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You are so complicated,” she whispered. “I can’t figure you out.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not really,” Shesan said. “It’s simple. Primal, even. What other choice do I have? Giving up?” She huffed. “Not on my life.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled at that. “Shesan?” she said in a small voice. “Will you tell me what happened? How you got here? Please?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan eyed her skeptically. “You really want to know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Yes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan seemed to consider it for a moment, then shrugged. “Yeah, okay. I guess it won’t hurt.” She motioned for Zelda to sit beside her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh…” Zelda stared blankly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh. Another vision. Right. She walked over and sat beside Shesan, self-conscious and stiff. Shesan extended a hand. Zelda quickly took it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan gripped her hand and smiled faintly, eyes closed. Were those tears? “It probably goes without saying, but—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Not a soul,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan looked her over, then gave a nod. “I warn you, it’s not pleasant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m ready.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Suit yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s awareness was overwhelmed by a flash of white light.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Her senses settled, but she barely understood anything she saw. It was past sunset, but it was well-lit everywhere, including inside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Were those… buildings? Towers? They were so incredibly tall. And a large array of… hovering metal ships in the distance?</span>
<br><br>
<span>A caravan?</span>
<br><br>
<span>No. A blockade.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Or a defensive perimeter?</span>
<br><br>
<span>A much younger Shesan stood by herself, looking out a window that stretched from the ceiling to the floor. Behind her, there were dozens of people. Most sitting in chairs or on the floor up against the walls, but others moving about, going about their business. Men, women, children. Some families, by the looks of it. Others alone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Some wore red uniforms, trimmed in black. Those that didn’t tended to look disheveled. The uniforms seemed to be going between them, gathering information.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Were they refugees?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda noticed Shesan was wearing an oversized uniform jacket that matched the others, but “normal” clothes underneath—or rather, clothes similar to those everyone else wore. Still strange by her standards.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>A disembodied, echoing voice said something Zelda didn’t understand. A few moments later, a uniformed woman came over to talk with Shesan. Shesan answered a series of questions patiently, but quickly grew frustrated. The woman seemed empathetic, but was clearly sticking to a script.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was she apologizing? Shesan repeated herself, growing more and more anxious as she did. Eventually the woman relented. She took out a… glowing slate? And tapped on its face, then frowned and held it over for Shesan to read.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>As Shesan read it, her mood changed. Sullen. Somber.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mournful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman asked her a final question, to which Shesan only nodded. She then handed her something. A device of some sort? Shesan strapped it to her wrist, which seemed to appease the woman, who took the cue to move on.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Outside there were… fireworks? Was there a celebration of some sort?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt extremely confused. She had no idea what was going on. Judging by the general atmosphere, no one was in the mood for celebration. Shesan least of all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The disembodied voice again. As it spoke, people began to stand and funnel towards a hallway near the back of the room. Shesan turned to follow them, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ground shook. The lights… flickered? And turned red. Blaring klaxons, sounding at rhythmic intervals. People were crying out. The uniforms began urging people to move more fervently.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan looked back over her shoulder, through the window. In the distance, the ground gave way in a massive eruption. A gigantic creature made of metal climbed out of the hole, heralded by a deafening, bone-chilling roar. The hovering ships began firing cannons at an unbelievable rate—but they did absolutely nothing to the creature. It was completely unfazed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nearly everyone was panicking now. Shesan looked horrified, unable to tear her eyes away. She wasn’t alone. Even some of the uniforms couldn’t help but stare.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Bright orbs of orange light gathered near the creature’s head, growing into a large ball of crackling energy. A moment later, it released that energy in a massive burst that lit up the sky—a strafing line that obliterated an entire flank of the defensive perimeter.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ground shook again, this time more forcefully, and it did not stop. The windows shattered, and Shesan grabbed hold of a nearby pillar. There was a loud boom followed by a deafening cacophony of sounds as the floor behind them gave way. Dust and debris, stone and metal flew everywhere as people screamed and cried out, scrambling and holding on for their lives.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>All of them plummeted to their deaths. All but Shesan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Outside—as if this wreckage could still be considered ‘inside’—rifts began to open in the sky, not that far away. Swirling vortices of shadow, encased in green light that radiated outward at irregular, right angles. Glowing green objects spilled from the rifts, flying out in all directions. Some headed towards the metal creature, others spread throughout the city.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>One flew up nearby. It seemed to notice Shesan and hovered over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan <i>screamed.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The object halted and backed away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan slid to the floor, crying. Sobbing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The object—a vehicle?—opened, revealing a strange creature inside. Its face was smooth, almost like a Zora’s. It was tall. Very tall, with long limbs and flowing robes.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>It stepped out of its vehicle onto stairs of green light that materialized from nowhere, then hopped down onto what was left of the floor of the ruined building, steading itself with its long limbs as it did so.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>It held out a hand to its left, and another rift appeared just a few feet away. This one was smaller than the others, less intricate. With its right hand, it beckoned to Shesan, urging her to go through.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan swallowed, then scrambled to her feet and ran.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>As Shesan dove through the rift, Zelda opened her eyes to find herself back in the boat, sitting on the padded bench next to her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wow,” was all she could think to say. “That was… wow.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Minutes passed as Zelda processed all she had just witnessed. The scale of it was mind-boggling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry you had to go through that,” she said at last.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t be,” Shesan said. “It was a long time ago. Lifetimes ago, it feels like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There’s so much more out there, isn’t there?” Zelda found herself saying. “And that was the same…the enemy?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked at Shesan, questioning. Shesan nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I had no idea…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I tried to tell you without <i>actually telling you</i>,” Shesan said. “Generally speaking, we try not to interfere in other worlds any more than we need to. It can be disconcerting. Overwhelming. Not that I’d know anything about that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘We?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shook her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then why are you showing me this now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan rested her face in her hand. “Because you all but begged me to? Because if I didn’t…” She looked at Zelda with a pitiable expression. “You basically said it yourself. How can you trust me if you don’t even know who I am?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Damnation, but the impulses Zelda felt right now…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was really going to do this, wasn’t she? It felt right, so she went for it. She slid a little closer to Shesan and leaned against her. Shesan casually reached up and ran a hand through her hair.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mmm. That felt nice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Emotional whiplash. Mental vertigo. Zelda closed her eyes and pressed her lips together as she rode it out. She knew she was vulnerable. Compromised, after all she had been through today—especially after just seeing that vision—but she didn’t care. She just wanted simple comfort.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She needed this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked up at Shesan. At her fiery red hair. Those beautiful, stormy grey eyes. Her freckled cheeks and soft, supple lips. She leaned in, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan pressed a finger to Zelda’s lips. Zelda froze. Oh no. Did she go too far?</span>
<br><br>
<span>But Shesan just pulled her closer, into her arms, and resumed running fingers through her hair. Zelda turned to get comfortable, relaxing into her embrace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t take it the wrong way,” Shesan said. “It’s just not my kind of thing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly. “Oh. Okay. Thanks for telling me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Thanks for telling me? Really? That’s the best you could come up with?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“I must confess, I did not think we’d find ourselves here,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Me either,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And yet…” Shesan laced the fingers of her left hand through Zelda’s right. Her touch was soothing. Gentle. Zelda pulled the hand to her lips and kissed it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Radiating warmth. Stirring affection. Butterflies. She hadn’t felt like this since…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think I admire you,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh really? I hadn’t noticed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda playfully jabbed an elbow into her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oof,” Shesan said, playing along. “I deserved that one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said seriously, turning slightly to look her in the eye. “I think you deserve better.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan eyed her back, askance. “You don’t mean that. You hate my guts. Want me punished for my crimes. Said so yourself. I can’t blame you, really. I’m guilty as charged. I’d hate me too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually, I’m finding it harder and harder to hate you the more I get to know you,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is that so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mhm. You’re oddly likable. In an intensely overbearing, bitchy kind of way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh? I guess you know your type.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda snorted, then quickly covered her face as if to escape from the embarrassment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You do that a lot, you know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda tensed, peeking out from behind her fingers. “Do what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Try to hide your emotions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nerves and uncertainty threatened to overwhelm her. She did her best to stay on top of them. “I… I don’t know what to say to that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you have to say anything to it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean… I don’t…” She took a calming breath. “I don’t know how I’m supposed to react.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged with a shake of her head. “Supposing there’s only one right way to act, or <i>react</i>? You’re free to do and feel as you please.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Well, duh</i>, Zelda thought. But then, why did she always…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. That was an interesting perspective to take, and she could immediately see so many new things from it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Many more things about herself, which she did not like.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s alright,” Shesan said. “I don’t mean to judge you. Just… well.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s complicated.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Try me,” Zelda insisted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan pursed her lips. “I guess I just want to make sure it’s intentional. That you are the way you are because that’s how you want to be. That’s all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t sound all that complicated.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I suppose it isn’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually, I think it’s quite sweet,” Zelda said with a smile, feeling pleasantly surprised. She never figured Shesan was capable of being so tender.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really? If so, there’s something wrong with your taste. Do you get sour and salty mixed up too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda laughed. “And I love your snarky wit! I pretend to hate it, but secretly I’m just envious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Also, don’t pretend you aren’t judging everyone and everything every second of every day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stop that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda giggled. “I also like that you call me ‘Zelda.’ Even in front of others—even if it’s also infuriating that you’re constantly eschewing titles and questioning my authority. I usually only prefer that people do that in private, but… no, I’ve always hated my station. Hate the impersonality of it, and how I’m just ‘the Queen’ to most everyone. But I don’t think that’s much of a secret.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not. And why do you think I do it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know,” Zelda said. “To prove you’re better than all of us backwards primitives?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Touché,” Shesan said with a pained expression. “Actually, it’s because if I cultivate a certain personality, then no one expects anything of me and I can get away with it. And a lot more, too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned to glance at her briefly. “You know, that makes a surprising amount of sense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A lull in their conversation. Zelda occupied herself by running her fingers along Shesan’s leg as she pondered. Her thoughts were immediately interrupted though as Shesan gently scratched her neck. Zelda pressed herself into it. It was such a wonderful sensation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So why’d you stop?” she asked a few moments later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hm? Want me to keep going?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I mean—err, yes. That’s really nice. Keep going. But I meant, with the eschewing of titles and such. Why’d you stop?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Lucia slipped up once or thrice and I felt it would draw attention if we kept alternating.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm. That, too, makes sense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I usually do have good reasons for things,” Shesan said. “I try to, anyway. If ever I don’t, I prefer to know sooner, that way I can stop and start doing something more reasonable instead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suppose I can see that,” Zelda said, trying her best to be thoughtful and considerate. “Eminently pragmatic of you. You’re hard to judge most of the time, though. Especially when you never tell anyone anything.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s fair.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But I think I like that about you too,” Zelda said. “Sometimes, anyway. That you don’t care what others think about you. That you’re content to let them come to their own conclusions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you sure you’re not just jealous that you can’t do the same?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know, you’re probably right,” Zelda said with a sad smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another lull. Zelda reached back and brushed her fingers against Shesan’s cheek. “Er—is that okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan held Zelda’s hand against her skin. “You’re right. This is nice,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, very much so. I much prefer this to whatever we were doing before.” Zelda said pensively. “If only you would’ve…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She noticed something just then. There was a fish outside the window, but it wasn’t moving. It wasn’t swimming in place, either. No—it was just… <i>frozen</i>. Unmoving. Unblinking.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan opened her eyes and seemed to take note of her confusion. She turned around, and the fish immediately began swimming again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Sorry,” she said. “Uhm… Try not to panic, but you should know that you never left the vision.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sat up abruptly. “Sorry, what?” She glanced around. “When were you going to tell me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan took her hands in hers. “Relax. You’re safe. We’re in the boat… and you’re asleep in my lap. Laylith just checked in on us. It’s fine.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda opened her mouth to speak, but just nodded instead. The realignment. Right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So… is any of this real?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That depends,” Shesan answered. “What do you define as ‘real?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blinked. “Uhm. Is this the real you? Your actual self? Are you aware of this conversation, or is it all in my mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan pondered for a moment. “I am aware of it, <i>and</i> it’s in your mind. You’ll forgive me for passing on the other questions, I hope.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So you’ll remember this after I wake up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda breathed a sigh of relief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You might not, though. Actually, three-to-one odds you don’t, depending on how disruptive the experience is for you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda startled. “What?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan winced. “Sorry. I figured if you did remember, there wouldn’t be any problem, and if you didn’t, it was probably best not to alarm you. Since the topic came up though, I’m not going to lie to you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nervously wrung her fingers. “I wish you would have told me sooner.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A slow nod. “My mistake. Won’t happen again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>As Zelda glanced around the cabin, she thought back to Link’s ordeal. “What about Fi? Is my connection to her still intact? —Is it safe to call her here?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good question, I don’t know, and probably but I don’t think you can reach her here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi?” Zelda tried.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No response. So much for that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about Lucia?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan frowned and shook her head slightly. “Best not, unless we absolutely have to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. So what now?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan stood up to pace. Zelda stood as well. “I can stay here as long as you want,” she said. “If you want, that is.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A half-suppressed smile. “Until I fall asleep, anyway.” Shesan continued, “Which I will have to do eventually. At which point, I’ll lose contact, and you’ll have to find your way back to yourself. Though preferably you can do that beforehand, because obviously we can’t help you after.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘Find my way back to myself?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not really sure how to phrase it more concisely than that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But how do I do that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan put her hands up in an exaggerated shrug.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan?” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re worrying me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She winced. “Yeah. Sorry. Not trying to. Just outlining my thoughts. To the best of my knowledge, given everything I know, it should be relatively safe for you. As I said, you strongly resonate with the ideals. And this is your mind after all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘Relatively’? And <i>my</i> mind? I thought it was—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I am projecting a vision into your mind, yes,” Shesan clarified.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…A bit more than just a vision,” Zelda said, glancing about again. She rubbed her arm. “Actually, it’s kind of disturbing when you frame it like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded slowly. “Admittedly yes. Which is why I make it a point to ask for consent first, and in most other circumstances try to keep it to exchanging information.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Implying you don’t necessarily need to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan pressed her lips together tightly. “You know, I really shouldn’t be talking about this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda groaned. “Not now. <i>Please</i>, not now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan closed her eyes and took a breath, then stepped forward and set her hands on Zelda’s shoulders. Zelda felt like she could lose herself in those beautiful swirls of grey. So intense…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda: Listen. Please, try and relax. It’s the most important thing you can do right now. There’s nothing to worry about. Probably.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Probably,” Zelda repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, there is most likely no actual danger to you,” Shesan said. “But depending on… well, a few things, your experiences might not be the most pleasant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So what are we talking about—fever dreams, a bad trip?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Something like that, yes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” Zelda said with a nod. “Alright, yeah. That doesn’t sound so bad. I’ve had a few of those.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It really shouldn’t be.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, I know you’re just being pedantic, but—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan pulled her in tight for an embrace, and Zelda relaxed into her arms with a contented sigh. Experimentally, she ran her hands down Shesan’s back, then went a bit further, feeling the fullness of her curves. “Mmm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan stifled a laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nothing. You’re just adorable. That’s all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you sure I can’t kiss you?” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, you can try. I just don’t expect—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pressed her lips into Shesan’s. She parted them slightly and ran her teeth along her skin. It felt…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She pulled back minutely. Shesan smiled and gave her a gentle peck. Zelda reciprocated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waited.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A fractional shake of the head. “I’m just not into it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Curious. “What are you into?” Zelda probed. “If you don’t mind me asking.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A flash of excitement. “May I demonstrate?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Sure?” Zelda said hesitantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan grabbed her by the back of the head with a fistfull of hair. Zelda gasped, eyes wide. And with her free hand, Shesan took Zelda’s and pressed their palms together.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s lips trembled as she waited in eager anticipation. All her thoughts melted away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing… but this? She peered deeply into Shesan’s eyes and her heart fluttered in her chest. It was just the two of them here, sharing this moment together. And under her gaze, Zelda felt as bare and exposed as she ever had. It was an odd sensation. Intense, though not unpleasant. Ordinary, yet wonderful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda giggled as Shesan brushed away a tear from her face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Something like that, anyway,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think I’m okay with this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?” A mischievous smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Zelda nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan stepped away and beckoned her back over to the padded bench. They sat, with Zelda curled in her lap. Zelda yawned and closed her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, uh. We can continue like this when I wake up, right? You’re okay with that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “Yeah. If you want, I suppose we can try it out.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think I would like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. If you still feel that way later, then tell me again after.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And if I don’t remember?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you want me to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yes. Please.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…You didn’t let me finish.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated, prying an eye open. “What were you going to say?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan smirked. “Nothing important. I’m not sure it matters?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda bit her lip and shook her head before sighing and closing her eyes again. “Just promise me you won’t let me forget, okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. I promise.”</span>
<br><br>
