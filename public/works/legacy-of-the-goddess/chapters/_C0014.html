<span>Zelda was up early—about an hour before dawn. Too much was on her mind, and her sleep was restless at best. She sat working by lantern light at a makeshift study in a clearing a few dozen yards from the Sunseeker encampment as she waited for the others to rise. It was as good a location as any for scrying, with a clear view of the sky overhead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Had Wymar yet decided on where to deploy the Sunseeker regiment? Had the Council found land for their tribe? Zelda had met again with Naibi shortly after their conversation with Shesan and got the impression they were keen on moving out sooner rather than later, but Naibi was… <i>upset</i> at her lack of information, and refused to give definite answers until Zelda could provide her with specifics on where her soldiers would be deployed and where the settlers would come to call home. Fair enough, she supposed. Zelda had tried to appease her, but Naibi wouldn’t hear it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda knew it was best not to fret. She had already sent the messages along—all that was left now was to wait. Still, she couldn’t help but feel anxious. Would they be able to prevent hostilities between the Sunseekers and Hylian soldiers? Would the Council even be able to find the land she promised? It had been a few days already. What was taking so long?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda supposed she could direct the Sunseekers to move on to Last Bastion while they waited, but that didn’t seem wise given there was so much mistrust already between the two factions. Blood had been spilled on both sides. The last real hostilities had been over a decade ago, but Zelda also knew it took wounds like that a great deal of time to heal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She scribbled more notes. So much to do. So many questions. She couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed. It seemed like that was all she knew these days…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“You’re up early.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned to see Laylith approaching with a pot of tea in hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah. Couldn’t sleep.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How are you holding up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well enough, I suppose.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not what I meant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith took a seat at the small table and poured two steaming cups of tea. Zelda took one graciously. It was delightful; warm and earthy, with a slight but noticeable bite.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Safflina?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re dodging,” she said after a moment, when Zelda didn’t answer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Does it matter?” Zelda replied tersely. “There’s work to do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda, we talked about this. It’s important you see to yourself first.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know—I know. But if I’m being honest, I just don’t have time for that right now. There’s too much to do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’ll never have enough time,” —they turned to see Izu approaching from the side. “That’s why you have to <i>make</i> time,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took a seat at the opposite side of the table. Laylith offered him tea but he declined. Zelda sighed, putting down her quill. “And how do I do that?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just do it,” Izu said simply. “Set aside a chunk of time for yourself—same time, every day. Regardless of how much work you have to do, or how important it is to get done. Even if it’s only fifteen minutes right after you wake up, or just before bed. You can always spare that much.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t sound like much,” Zelda said curiously. “What do you do with that time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I wittle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really?” Laylith said skeptically. “Whittling?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, worked for my pa,” Izu said with a shrug. “I never thought much of it either until I tried it. It’s relaxing. Helps clear the mind.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well,” Laylith said. “I like to take time to meditate whenever I have the opportunity. There’s plenty of dull moments throughout the day. I just let whatever’s on my mind come to the fore, examine it uncritically and without judgement, then let it pass. I do that until there’s nothing pressing for my attention, or until I have to get going again. You’d be surprised how far that gets you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Thank you,” Zelda said, nodding. “I might try that.” She looked back to her notes. “Later. Right now, there’s work to do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“First item of business—” she said, preempting any objections. “Shesan said there was a Sheikah working opposite Vesyrn, who it turns out is one of her agents working on recovering Triforce fragments and keeping them out of the hands of the enemy. I wasn’t aware we had anyone actively tracking him down?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan?” Laylith asked. “<i>Vesyrn?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Lynx. And I am not keen on her methods; however, I have reason to believe she is acting in good faith. It is best to cooperate for now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Okay, if you say so.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Vesyrn,</i>” Izu grumbled, shaking his head. “Unless Wymar sent some of his, I don’t believe we have anyone actively looking for him. And given the circumstances, that isn’t likely. We’ll want to double check to be sure, but if I had to guess, it’s Allanah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh? Do we know for certain she’s alive?” Zelda asked, somewhat surprised.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu looked to Laylith.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Laylith said. “Nothing certain. But I can count on one hand how many Sheikah could give Vesyrn a hard time, and two of them aren’t with us any longer. My money’s on Allanah too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded solemnly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It will be rough, but if we can get additional details on his location from Shesan, I’m sure we can send a squad to rendezvous,” Laylith said. “What should the direction be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well… I know it’s unsavory,” Zelda said, “but if they could work together to track down the leads, that would be ideal. I’ll speak with Shesan about getting a message to him too. In lieu of that, at least get whoever is tracking him down to back off for the time being. Better that than it coming to a fight. Any other ideas?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sounds reasonable enough,” Izu said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t have anything to add at the moment,” Laylith said, dipping a quill to ink and beginning an encoded transcription.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good,” Zelda said. “Moving on…” She scanned her notes. “I spoke with Naibi to get a better idea of when they were planning on leaving. No definite answers, but it will be more or less as a single group. A week at the earliest, and sooner rather than later. She wants specifics before they are to leave. Have we received word from Wymar or the Council yet?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We have, actually,” Izu said. “From the Lord General at least. Came in late last night. They’re to reinforce at the Fork and await further orders. He signed off allowing them to maintain their own units and command structure—that should go a ways towards avoiding unnecessary friction. Their leader—I assume Naibi?—will report directly to High Captain Melise of Hylia’s Watch, who I understand is heading up the southern defenses.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wonderful!” Zelda said, feeling relieved to hear Wymar was on top of it. “I’m certain Naibi will appreciate the news. Though… any word from the Council?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“None,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda crossed her arms, grumbling under her breath. “I expected they might drag their feet on this. Instruct Chancellor Nyllara personally to prioritize finding a suitable location. In the meantime I think we have enough to send the Sunseekers on their way by way of Castletown. We can dump them on Taetus’ lap if it comes to it. Their actual presence should provide ample impetus to relocate them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith chuckled and shook her head as she took notes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er—are you sure that’s wise?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said frankly. “But we need those soldiers on the front as soon as possible. Do you think we’ll have trouble finding the land in time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, just offering a blue rupee,” Izu said, raising his hands in submission. “You make a fair point about urgency—I’m just concerned about provoking the Council unnecessarily. There’s almost certainly going to be dozens of claims made on any and all abandoned property. Blood rights, wills, and the like. I’m not an expert by any means, but I expect any delays might be due to the legal system being tied up with exactly those kinds of disputes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm, perhaps,” Zelda said, seriously considering the possibility. “Still, I wouldn’t put it past them to stall just so they can try and find more leverage to use against me. I understand the hesitancy but—no, we don’t have time for politics.” She turned to Laylith.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You can amend my instructions to Nyllara. Have her find the most suitable location, and the Crown will purchase all interests to it outright from any legitimate claimants. Have Taetus negotiate as necessary. Inform them the Sunseekers may be there within three weeks at the earliest, and I expect the matter to be resolved by then.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith nodded, scribbling furiously. Zelda tried to read after her, but she couldn’t make sense of the shorthand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Done. Anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned back to her notes. What else? “Ah, yes. One more thing. I want to make contact with the Gorons as soon as possible. Delegate this to Lensa—again, top priority. I want a report on everything we know about them, including an assessment as to why relations broke down. If at all possible, send an envoy warning whoever will listen about our common enemy. Offer them our assistance. Let them know we have reason to believe Ganondorf may turn his sights upon them soon. I authorize use of a Sheikah escort if necessary.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is it really true they demanded your great-grandfather fight a Lynel in single combat?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shrugged. “That’s what they say. Who knows for certain? Hopefully we can get to the bottom of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And… got it,” Laylith said. “I think that has to be it. We’re pushing the limits of what we can transmit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, that’s not an issue,” Zelda said. “I can have Fi restore your magic as needed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And that’s well enough,” Laylith said, “but we aren’t the bottleneck. Remember that it’s just Malg and Ryn relaying it to Last Bastion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Zelda said, suddenly feeling rather foolish. “In that case, let’s stagger the message regarding the Gorons until we’re certain we have sufficient capacity. I want to ensure they can still get priority messages back to us if necessary.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Will do,” Laylith said. She turned to Izu. “Ready?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep. Here goes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda watched as he jerked back in his chair, eyes going white. He would scry the fifty or so kilometers back to the makeshift Scry-tower and make contact through Telepathy, letting those at the other end know to expect a message and outlining its contents. Laylith would then do the same, transmitting the exact encoded message to be transcribed and relayed at the other end. It was fascinating, though tedious work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Best leave them to it. Zelda quietly stood, patting Laylith on the shoulder as she rose. Laylith squeezed her hand with a smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much to do. Zelda gathered her notes and set out to find Link.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“—and so, as a symbol of alliance between our factions, I propose we mark you as Hylia’s third champion as soon as we are able.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah,” Shesan said with a snort of derision. “No.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No?!</i> This woman! What was her deal?!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why not?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, most pertinently, it won’t work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Why not?” he asked again, sounding every bit as annoyed as Zelda felt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do I have to spell everything out for you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, just—” Zelda took a breath, trying to keep herself composed. “Can you at least tell us what you know about how this works? You clearly know <i>something</i>, which is more than what we can say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not my problem,” Shesan said bluntly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How can you even say that?!” Zelda said. “This is obviously extremely important, or else Hylia wouldn’t have bothered with me. And if we don’t know what we’re doing, then—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Listen</i>,” Shesan said, smacking her hand against the table. “We are not friends. We are at best allies of convenience. I was sent here on a mission, and all I care about is completing that mission and returning home. If we are to work together, then these are my terms. Ask whatever you want. If you need to know something, I will tell you. If you don’t, I won’t. Simple as that. Further, you will not question me nor my methods at any step, and you will not get in my way. To the extent I can avoid collateral damage, I will. To the extent I can steer towards less ruinous outcomes for your world, I will. But do not expect me to wring my hands at doing what is necessary. That clear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t like this,” Zelda said, a cold anger burning in her chest. “I don’t like <i>you</i>,” she said frankly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not asking you to like it. I’m telling you to either suck it up and deal with it, or else get lost and stop wasting my time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wasting <i>her</i> time? Who in damnation did she think she was?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda bit back her tongue. She knew she couldn’t afford to antagonize Shesan. Even so, her mind flashed to memories of Father’s stiff and hollow body; alive, yet lifeless at the same time. Zelda resolved that if they were to make it out of this, she would see to it that Shesan answered for her crimes.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>One way, or the other.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” she said calmly, focusing on the immediate and letting her intentions pass. “As for working together, I want to prioritize finding the remaining fragments. I’m willing to redirect the Sheikah and other resources at my disposal to this task. You mentioned Golvara—that he was working to recover Nineve’s fragment. Does he need help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That would be welcome, yes. I have limited assets in that region. Ja’bu is not a sophisticated enemy, but the turned Zora are proving to be more difficult than anticipated. A surgical strike may be precisely what we need.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you tell us anything more about Ja’bu?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Only that he’s an ancient Void entity that spans many worlds. He seems to have some connection with the Zora, but from what I’ve gathered, even they don’t fully understand it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what does that mean in practical terms? How much of a danger is he to us? To my kingdom?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Less so than a Blight? I can’t say for sure. By all indications he’s only concerned with the Zora. Practically, you only need to worry about what they’re capable of while under his thrall.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. That was at least moderately reassuring. From the messenger’s account, less than a fifth of the Zora had been turned. So long as the others were around to work against them, it seemed Hyrule was not in any immediate danger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well,” Zelda said. “If you can provide me with more details, I’ll send orders to have a skilled team travel downriver and extract him. I would also like the opportunity to speak with him again when he returns.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Shesan said. “Out of the question. I’ll get you the information you need as soon as I have it—but no, you will not meet with Golvara.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pursed her lips. “What about the fragment? And I have questions for him besides—questions regarding Link’s visions, among other things. <i>A vast basin, teeming with life</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As for the fragment, we will arrange a transfer. As for your questions, you can ask me directly. But do not interfere with my agents.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You cannot expect me to leave Naibi to her own devices in the heart of my kingdom,” Zelda said bitterly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Naibi is an exception; her arrangement with you fulfils a promise I made to her many years ago. She will discharge her duties faithfully, and without conflict. And she will not interfere in your kingdom. You have my word.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I do not detect any attempts at deception, Mistress.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” Zelda said, though she did have to wonder how long Shesan had been at this game. How many agents did she have, exactly? “Can you at least provide me with a list of <i>my</i> Sheikah agents that were compromised by Vesyrn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’d have to ask Vesyrn that. I don’t micromanage my subordinates.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was a jab at her, wasn’t it? Zelda grit her teeth, but didn’t bite back. “While we’re on the subject,” she said, “I’ve done what I can to get in touch with the Sheikah interfering with his efforts, instructing them to either cooperate or back off. However, we don’t have much to go on. Would you be willing to provide me with more details as to his location?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure. Southeast of the Faron Woods, and north of the ruins of Byrna. And yes, I will get a message to him at the earliest opportunity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Excellent. Thank you.” Why couldn’t everything be as straightforward?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I could cut in for <i>just a minute</i>—” Link said hesitantly, “I wanted to touch back on my visions. Also I wanted to mention, I think they might be related to the Champion’s Trials.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The what now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Champion’s Trials,” Link repeated. “You know, where Hylia’s chosen champion goes on adventures, slays giant monsters, explores mysterious locations, and unlocks their true potential as they earn the Goddesses’ favor?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t say I’m familiar,” Shesan said skeptically. “Where did you get this information?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, Zelda’s research?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cleared her throat. “That research isn’t—ah… isn’t based on primary sources,” she said, feeling her face flush. “But yes, it does appear that these stories have a very real basis, and I concur with Link that we should also prioritize finding and exploring the locations in his visions. Aside from the obvious connection to Lightsworn, there may well be additional fragments hidden away at these locations—or at the very least, more leads to follow up on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “I have to admit, it’s a distinct possibility. Did you need assistance?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We already know roughly where the Obsidian Spire is located,” Zelda said. “Maybe just a guide? I plan to go with Link and the Sheikah we have on hand to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>No</i>, I’m going alone,” Link said irritably. “You have more important things to do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, we talked about this,” Zelda said quietly, annoyed at him for airing their dispute in front of the woman who had just told them in no uncertain terms they were not friends.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You mean <i>you</i> talked about this,” he half-muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry—did you two of you need some time alone?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No.” / “Yes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cocked her head to the side, studying Link; he was obviously distressed. She knew he was only doing what he thought was best. Still… </span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’ll discuss the details later,” Zelda said to him. “And I mean actually discuss them. Promise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” he said after a moment. “Sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Finished?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda chose to ignore her. “We will in some capacity be visiting the Obsidian Spire soon. As for the other locations, could you tell us anything you know about them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure. Describe them again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Did she truly not know already, or was she simply feigning ignorance? Zelda flipped through her notes, reading from the relevant pages. “A palace in the middle of a forest near a river, with a great chasm at its center. A vast basin teeming with life, around an island perpetually surrounded by fog. A temple built from living wood and shaped into a sprawling labyrinth. A lone volcanic mountain surrounded by a ring of islands somewhere out at sea.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The palace—that sounds like the ruins on the western banks of the River Hylia, opposite the Faron Woods. And the basin likely refers to Zora’s Basin, at the heart of their domain. No idea about the others.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you,” Zelda said, jotting down notes. The Zora’s Domain—that complicated matters substantially. She looked to Link, but his mind appeared to be preoccupied.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Moving on for now,” she said after a moment, “I wanted to discuss another potential fragment location. I take it you know about the abilities bestowed by my Wisdom fragments?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re referring to prophetic dreams?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Zelda said. “One such dream was in a heavily wooded location. I saw an odd man there huddled around a campfire. He wore a necklace with a jagged golden fragment, much like Link’s. I believe the dream may be referring to the Lost Woods. I’m hesitant to do so, but I was thinking we should send a team to investigate?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lost Woods, Zelda knew, were aptly named. Fanciful tales aside, few who ventured into those mist-shrouded woods ever returned—and those who did were not the same. It went without saying that anyone with any sense about them steered well clear. Naturally, various expeditions had been attempted throughout the ages, but every one of them had resulted in catastrophic failure. The worst of which was when Mira the Wise—nearly a hundred years before the Gerudo Wars—decided to burn the forest down from afar, one tree at a time. Not a week in, her entire camp disappeared without a trace overnight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Shesan said, looking to be deep in thought. “Tricky. Very tricky. But absolutely, yes. Worth looking into.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you know something about the Lost Woods we don’t?” Zelda asked. “Because if I’m going to ask people to risk their lives, they need to be informed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan hesitated. “No. —At least, nothing I’m willing to share,” she quickly amended.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, I believe Shesan is intentionally hiding information from you.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>That wasn’t going to cut it. Zelda couldn’t let this one slide. “Look: whatever your deal is, I don’t care. But you can’t expect me to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—People go in, they rarely come out,” Shesan said. “Those who do invariably turn out to be gibbering idiots. Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Something like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have my theories, but even if I knew how to explain them to you, it wouldn’t make an expedition any safer. Depending on how we go about it and what you need to know at that time, I might reconsider.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rolled her eyes, but decided not to press. “How about we table it for now and circle back once we have the rest sorted out?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine by me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan?” Link said, looking up. “You said you knew about Wisdom fragments. What about Power and Courage? Can you tell us anything more about how they work?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That depends. Have you found a reliable source of information aside from the Order of Sages?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda answered. “We learned what we know from High Priestess Vestele, specifically.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then no, unfortunately,” Shesan said. “You know as much as I do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what about this business with bonding?” Link asked. “We didn’t know anything about that until you told us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And now you do! Funny, that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Could you be more unhelpful?” Zelda muttered under her breath. She was already nearing her limits, and they had barely scratched the surface of the topics she intended to cover.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In fact I could, yes,” Shesan said. “But I’m not going to guess as to what you don’t know. Did you have any <i>specific</i> questions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, actually,” Link said before Zelda could cut back. “How do the fragments know who ‘owns’ them? And how are you so sure neither of us can bond with the Power fragment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Describe Zelda in one word.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh?” Link scratched his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan motioned to him as if to say “Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… idealistic?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And do you know anyone more idealistic than Zelda?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” he said. “Not even close.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Idealistic?</i> Zelda supposed that described her well enough—but was that really her most dominant trait?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan turned to her. “Describe Link in one word.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Selfless.” That was easy. She didn’t even have to think about it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And do you know anyone more selfless than Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said, suddenly seeing the connection for herself. “…Not even close.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded. “Exactly. There are certain <i>ideals</i> that your fragments resonate with. It isn’t precisely <i>idealism</i> and it isn’t precisely <i>selflessness</i>, but they’re close. I can’t say for certain, but I am willing to bet that Ganondorf embodies a similar ideal, and further that neither of you share it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That made sense enough, but… how could someone like <i>Ganondorf, the Exiled King</i> resonate with the ideals of the Golden Goddesses?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Umm, Shesan?” Link asked. “Do you have any other agents in Hyrule that we should know about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you need to know, you can ask about them and I will tell you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about Seff?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shot him a look. What did Seff have to do with anything? She knew about his attempted theft, but could he really be one of Shesan’s agents?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can’t say I know anyone by that name. Describe him?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A minstrel?” Link offered. “Tall, angular face, sharp nose. Kind of arrogant, speaks in riddles?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Nope! Doesn’t sound like any of mine. Sorry. Why do you ask?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda noticed a change in Shesan’s demeanor just then, but couldn’t exactly place it. Was it her body language? Her tone? Or maybe it was just what she didn’t say. Fi wasn’t sounding the alarm though, so maybe she was looking too much into it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because he tried to steal my fragment,” Link answered. “He used my participation in his play as a pretense and had a stagehand lift it from me during the performance.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Shesan said. “Curious. Did you find out why?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, but he seemed to know it would come back to me. And that it, uh… <i>resonated</i> with me. Actually, I’m pretty sure he said exactly that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Strange. Do you know how he found out about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“From my uncle, I think? They used to be in the same troupe, but that was a long time ago.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm. And do you know where he is now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Actually, I tried to track him down,” Zelda said warily. “But no luck. No one has seen him since the siege. —Sorry, why is he of interest to you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “A potential source of information. It may be just a fluke, but if he has knowledge we don’t, I would certainly call that interesting. Wouldn’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suppose I would,” Zelda said, studying her carefully. She found it rather odd Shesan didn’t know about the attempted theft of Link’s fragment given everything else she knew, but perhaps Link just hadn’t come to her attention at that point.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Speaking of— Zelda was almost certain Shesan wouldn’t be willing to reveal anything about herself, but she had to ask. “I don’t suppose you could tell us anything about your magic? Like the vision you showed us?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nope, sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda strummed her fingers on the table. She might have been too transparent with that line of reasoning. “Just to be clear: how is it you’ve managed to find out so much about us? About everything else you know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What can I say? Hard work and persistence goes a long way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>As if</i>—Zelda wasn’t about to buy that drivel. “Would you tell us if you had some way of magically divining the location of Triforce fragments? Or another similarly useful way of obtaining information at a distance? Because if you did, that seems like something you ought to clue us in about.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I possessed such abilities and thought they were directly relevant or otherwise important for you to know about, then yes I would tell you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I judge her assertion to be sincere, Mistress.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her face. As eager as she was to continue being derided and disrespected at every turn in exchange for half-answers and misdirections, even her patience had its limits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, earlier you referred to Fi as a ‘construct,’” Link said. “What did you mean by that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just what I said—she’s a sentient being constructed from the Void itself and held together by magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh huh,” Link said mirthlessly. “I mean that’s not exactly what I think of when someone says the word ‘construct,’ but okay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was he being <i>sassy</i>? Zelda tried and failed to suppress a laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Er, does that make her a voidspawn?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, not exactly,” Shesan said, waving a hand. “I mean technically, yes, but she was created to serve a particular purpose. Minds like ours are not very good at certain types of tasks. Constructs like her, however, have nearly perfect memory, notice many details we miss, and are capable of thinking logically in a way that rarely, if ever leads to mistaken beliefs or contradictions. On the other hand, they lack what you or I would call ‘intuition,’ and may not realize or fully understand many things we would consider obvious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So there are others like her?” Zelda asked, opting not to comment on the monumental understatement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “Yeah, lots. I haven’t seen any others around <i>here</i>, but… elsewhere, yeah. They’re fairly common.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then can you tell us more about constructs?” Zelda asked. “Or about Fi in particular?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry, that’s about it. I’m not an expert.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But would you say she’s ‘typical’ as far as constructs go? I mean, as far as you know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about Old Magic, then? Can all constructs do the same kinds of things she can?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not all of them, no, but they can be designed to interact with the world in rather subtle and complex ways. She’s not unique in that regard—though as far as I know, she might have been created by one of your goddesses. Who knows.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Subtle and complex</i>— “Is there anything <i>actually useful</i> you’re willing to share?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You can ask specific questions. I may or may not answer them, depending.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grumbled to herself. “Okay. I’ve done some work with Fi to research extensions to her abilities and to try and understand more about Old Magic in general. Aside from creating a minor energy-restoring effect, we haven’t had much success. Can you tell me anything about how this kind of thing works, or how to do it more effectively?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, yes, they are capable of improving and altering their own function,” Shesan said. “That’s next to useless, however, unless you already know enough about what you’re doing enough to guide them. And just a word of advice—but you really, <i>really</i> should not be playing around with things you don’t understand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yeah, whatever. “Then what about her connection to Fae?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan raised an eyebrow at that. “How do you mean?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh? I mean, I couldn’t help but notice her colors were the same as the opal of the scepter at the temple. —And also the barrier in the vision you showed us, now that I think about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As I said, she was made from the Void. Fae are touched by the Void. That connection isn’t particularly surprising. Or was there something else you had in mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head minutely. “No.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t understand,” Link said with a frown. “Isn’t the Void bad? Like <i>Demise</i> bad? I’m pretty sure the Emissary of Hylia isn’t evil.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Void isn’t evil, Link. It just <i>is</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what about—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—To clarify, most of what’s out there isn’t particularly interesting,” Shesan said. “And in the same vein, it’s just as uninterested in us. But there are some void entities—like Morudo Geira, Ja’bu, and,” she sighed, “<i>Demise</i>—that are more or less <i>ambitious</i>, and also not compatible with life as we know it. Are they evil? Eh. Close enough. Not worth splitting hairs.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then what’s the deal with sacrificing people?” he asked. “I can’t help but notice a few similarities between what Morudo Geira was doing with the Gerudo and what Cyrae did with Arminel.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s… difficult to explain,” Shesan said. “Some void entities require something like residual life energies to sustain themselves. They require sacrifice to survive. It’s part of what they are.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what exactly counts as a sacrifice?” he asked. “I mean, armies going to war and young men fighting each other to the death… okay, those are kind of similar, but—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>I don’t know, Link.</i>” Shesan said. “Seriously, honestly, truly: I do not know. It may be that the world itself is the sole arbiter of what counts and what doesn’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Okay</i>,” he said slowly. “So can things other than people be sacrificed?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. Anything with value can be sacrificed. That’s why it’s called sacrifice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Value to <i>who</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about the Triforce? Have you thought that maybe Ganondorf is gathering it to sacrifice it to Demise?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s—<i>what?</i> No,” Shesan groaned, covering her face. “No, Link, it absolutely does not work like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. Sorry. Just had to ask.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took the lull in the conversation as an opportunity to gather up her notes. She could really use a break before—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry, one more question,” Link said. “Back to Morudo Geira. Given that I’m going to its ‘binding location,’ could you share anything you know about it? And before you say anything, that sounds kind of important and directly relevant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Yes, I suppose it does,” Shesan said ruefully. “Let’s see. Geira is a void entity that had a… <i>fragment</i> of herself trapped and sealed away here long, long ago. Possibly before or during the creation of your world. Whether she still has any power remaining here is an open question, but I’d bet against it. I don’t know how Ganondorf managed to kill her avatar, but I assure you it is very, <i>very</i> dead. I know; I’ve seen it myself. Geira will not be a threat to you in any capacity should you venture to the spire. Does that answer your question?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Link said, sounding disappointed. “Yeah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda boggled at him. Did he really consider it bad news that he wouldn’t be facing down the avatar of an ancient evil being of unspeakable horror? “<i>Well,</i>” she said. “At any rate, I think it’s about time—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Sorry, sorry,” Link interjected. “Just one more question, because we kind of skipped over this earlier. Do you know of anyone that would be willing to guide me there?” —Zelda glared at him pointedly, but he paid her no mind. “I mean, I’d be happy to ask around town, but I’d rather not step on any toes. You know, since—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Talk to Naibi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Are you sure? Because last time I did she tried to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Yes</i>, I am sure. Tell her I sent you. She’ll find someone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. Thanks.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stood, clearing her throat. Despite her general disdain for this woman, courtesy was still—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know I said just one more,” Link said, “but this really is the last one. Do you know anything about the Sword of Evil’s Bane?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan looked to him with an expression of sheer, unmitigated disbelief. “You know, sometimes stories really are just stories. Right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But it’s too much of a coincidence!” he said, growing excited. “Don’t you see? The stories said it could counter <i>soulsteel</i>, and we know from Vestele that one is real. In fact, it sounds to me like it’s just a nastier version of bloodrage. And who uses bloodrage? <i>The Blin.</i> —I mean, I guess they also used to use soulsteel. Anyway, my point is—<i>who’s controlling the Blin?</i>” He waggled his eyebrows as if to punctuate this absolutely infallible chain of reasoning. “If you ask me, this sounds like exactly the type of weapon to have against an entity as powerful as Demise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, sure does,” Shesan said dryly. “And I will be certain to notify you immediately should I find a Sword of Evil’s Bane lying around somewhere.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…You don’t believe me, do you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan gasped. “What could have possibly given you that impression?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, I get it, okay?” Link said, deflating. “Still, you have to admit it would be cool.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned to him. “Link, I think we should—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about the Lightsworn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know anything about the Lightsworn that you likely don’t also know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>What?</i> Then how were you so sure—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Because I have a functional brain!</i>” Shesan snapped.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gaped at her. “Shesan? Do you think it would kill you to be a little less rude all the time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Maybe,” she muttered. “I’d rather not risk it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was that a joke?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan turned to Zelda. “Are we done here? We’re done here. Or does he intend to spend the rest of the day wasting my time asking questions he already knows the answer to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure, yeah,” Link said. “Sorry about that. —Say, do you think we could chart out all the locations we talked about? Just really quickly before we leave. I know Zelda loves her maps, but almost all the ones we have outside of Hyrule just say ‘here there be dragons.’ Not all that useful if you ask me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know I’m going too, right? When the Sunseekers leave?” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Oh.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“<i>Link!</i>” Zelda hissed, rounding on him almost as soon as they reached camp. “Have you already forgotten about the assassins?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I haven’t,” he said, feeling rather insulted. “I just don’t think they’re much of a threat right now. At least, they aren’t any more of a threat than any of the larger scale threats we face.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She paused at that. Link wasn’t sure what she was thinking. They had been over this issue a dozen times already, and her reasons changed every time. He was beginning to suspect her real objection was just not wanting to be left out. He could certainly sympathize with that. However, one of them was a fledgling Lightsworn and the other a queen. Each of them had their duties, and hers was certainly not following him into ancient cursed haunted wellsprings of evil while somehow still wanting to remain safe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But how can you know that for sure?” she said. “And even if you’re right, I can’t justify sending you out by yourself to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Zelda, you’re being ridiculous!” Link said, perhaps too impertinently. However, she needed to be made to understand. “Look—do you really want to burn two weeks’ time traveling there and back, just so you can sit around for however much longer it takes to explore? There are so many more things you could be doing in that time! And no, I’m not certain about anything, but I do know you are as safe as you’re ever going to be.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The attempt at Castletown was only as successful as it was because they caught us off-guard in an unsecured location with ample time to plan. They likely burned their best agents in the attempt too—judging from the information we got out of the spy we captured while leaving. At the <i>very least</i> you should be safe waiting here or at Last Bastion for me to get back. I trust Izu to handle security.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Fine!</i> Fine,” she said, turning her back to him and crossing her arms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda, I—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—You’re at least taking some of the Sheikah with you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He… <i>what?</i> “But I thought—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—This is not open for discussion!” she said, turning her head to face him. “You are taking a full squad with you, and that’s that. We can’t risk you coming to harm. I’ll wait and leave with the Sunseeker regiment and we’ll go back by way of Last Bastion. I’ll talk with Izu and figure out the rest. Okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Why are you so worried about me all of a sudden?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because someone has to look out for you too, Link.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With that, she left him standing alone as she made her way back to her tent.</span>
<br><br>

    <span><b><u>Zelda’s Journal</u></b></span>
</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>29th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link and the others left this morning. I’ve had enough of Shesan for the time being, and I’m left with little else to do while we wait, so I have decided to focus on research.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I had an interesting idea I hoped would bear fruit. Fi can restore our magic, and Siphon is a thing, so shouldn’t we be able to reverse the process and store excess magic with Fi? She could then reverse her conversions, and we would have excess Divine Power as a result.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to work; her avatar can’t be affected by Siphon. Both I and Cove tried, but neither of us felt any magic to pull from. I asked if she might be able to figure out some way to Siphon magic directly from us herself. She said she was unwilling to try as it posed substantial danger to the test subject. I’m not sure if we should proceed. Perhaps if we can capture some fiends to test on first? But finding some with magical affinity might be tricky. Maybe a captured Blin?</span>
<br><br>
<span>As I expected, she was able to restore others’ magic besides just me and Link. However, it appears to incur a much greater cost—something like an eighty-five to ninety percent loss factor, as opposed to the usual fifteen. Similarly, the rejuvenation effect incurred the same cost. I was hoping this would lead to a way to increase travel speed, by restoring the energy of a swift horse. Perhaps worth trying still, though it may well be prohibitively expensive.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Hey. Link! Wake up.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stirred awake. He pried his eyes open to see Grenja towering over him. “Wha?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>C’mon,</i>” Grenja said, giving him a not-so-gentle prod to the side with his foot. “Up already! Ryn’s on her way back. She followed a couple bandits to their camp. Apparently they’re pretty close.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Bandits, huh? That wasn’t unexpected—they had been warned to expect bandits on the way to the spire. Only, Link didn’t think they’d come across any so soon. They had made camp a fair way into the mountains, with their tents and horses tied up under the face of some rocky crags. It had been a hard day’s ride from the Sunseeker encampment and they were making good time, but that wouldn’t hold if they had to deal with bandits every step of the way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja gave him another prodding.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey! Okay, I’m up!” Link said. He pried himself from his bedroll, rubbing his eyes. “How long until she’s back?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any minute now,” Grenja said. “Waiting on you, leader-man!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Be right there,” Link said, waving him on. He dressed himself as Grenja left the tent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The scenery here was quite a bit different from what he pictured it would be. There were no vast dunes of sand or endless sprawling deserts. Rather, there were literal mountains of rocks and sandy dirt, spreading out as far as the eye could see. The landscape between the mountains was littered with smaller rocks, shrubs, and the occasional cactus here and there, but mostly it was just more gravel and sandy dirt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link emptied some out of his boots before he slipped them on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Their group—or the “Party to Totally Lay Waste to all Evil” as Koja put it—was composed of himself, Ryn, and the siblings Grenja and Koja. He considered taking Malg along at first, as the older Sheikah likely had invaluable experience. Link got along with him well enough, but apparently Grenja couldn’t stand the guy, so he decided to take Ryn along instead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The black-haired woman was a bit of a loner and didn’t talk much. Link understood that well, and so never got in her way. She seemed friendly enough with Koja though. Not surprising, since Koja was probably the most laid-back person he’d ever encountered. A stark contrast to her brother’s boisterousness and over-the-top bravado.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link cocked his head as the sound of shifting gravel alerted him to someone approaching. Had to be Ryn. He strapped on his sword and slung his bow and quiver over his shoulder, ducking out of the tent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bandits,” Ryn said, coming into view. She pointed over her shoulder. “About four kilometers that way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you get a good look?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Ryn said. “Camp’s larger than I expected. I counted nineteen, but there could be several more depending on how many others were out on patrol. What do you want to do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link paused to consider the question. He had plenty of experience leading squads from his time at Talus, but wasn’t exactly used to ordering Sheikah around. He turned to the other two. Grenja was standing at his side a couple paces away, and Koja was lying on her back near the campfire, staring up at the sky.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja? Koja? What are your thoughts?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah! Do you even have to ask? I say we take ’em all out!” Grenja said, slamming a fist into his hand and grinning like an idiot. “Those lawless scum—they deserve what’s coming. We’d just be doing our duty, Gerudo lands or not!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh, can’t we just go around them?” Koja said, coming up to rest on her elbows.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, they’re right in our way,” Ryn said. “Not unless we want to add half a day to the trip. We could try riding past them, maybe. I only counted six horses.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They all turned to Link. It was his decision to make.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He weighed the options.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t think we should risk trying to outride them,” he said after a moment. “It’s a long journey ahead, and I don’t want to push our horses too hard. Best just to take them out.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s my man!” Grenja said with a slap to his back. “Alright, let’s do this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja hummed in agreement and rose to her feet with a stretch and a yawn. Ryn was already sketching a crude map into the dirt with a stick. She outlined some hills around the camp before lazily marking positions with squares and stick figures.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The main camp’s right there, with five larger tents all in a row,” she said, delivering her report. “To the side is a trough and feeding area where they keep their horses, along with a several oxgoats. There’s several smaller tents closer to the perimeter. Here, here, and here, are roughly where the guards outside the camp are stationed. Six in total. I saw them wandering around chatting, but they didn’t have any clearly defined patrol routes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Arms?” Koja asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Poorly equipped,” Ryn said. “Likely just a bunch of two-bit thieves. Besides the ones on post I didn’t see many awake either. I don’t think they’ll be much trouble.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,“ Link said. “In that case let’s hit them head on. Grenja and I can go in with a pincer attack after you two take out the lookouts, then you can mop up any stragglers. Sound good?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure thing.” / “Right on!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Works for me,” Koja said cheerfully. “I’m not going to complain about the boys doing all the hard work.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>All clear,</i> Ryn said telepathically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link signaled to Grenja and they parted ways. They kept low to the ground, staying under the brush as they slowly advanced. A few minutes later and they were in position at the camp’s perimeter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Idly, Link wondered if now would be a good time to practice his newfound magical talent. Might as well, he supposed. There were at most thirteen bandits left inside the camp, after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stalked past a rickety wooden fence and spotted three of them lazing about a small campfire roughly ten paces ahead. They wore simple brown cloaks, rugged and well-worn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Drawing on his blue affinity, Link allowed his thoughts to diffuse. A tide of sensations flooded his awareness, sounds and visions washing over one another as they competed for his attention. He stumbled and shook his head, clearing his mind and easing up on his magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The leftmost bandit turned abruptly and spotted him. “ꡦꡌꡟꡊꡒꡍꡒ! ꡦꡟꡘꡍꡍ ꡟꡌꡫꡲꡢꡱ ꡨ꡵ꡟꡊꡊ!” she yelled, alerting the camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Damnation.</i> Oh well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In one smooth motion, Link drew, nocked, and loosed an arrow directly into the woman’s face. It landed with a wet <i>thunk</i> and she dropped to the ground. In quick succession, two more arrows flew from his bow and two more bodies fell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The camp roared to life with the panicked sounds of a dozen people scrambling for their weapons and yelling over one another, trying to make sense of the chaos. From the far side, Grenja tore forward in a blur and landed a haymaker on the closest target. His fist made a loud <i>crack</i> as it connected, likely shattering the man’s skull. Four other bandits turned on him, weapons drawn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned to see a screaming woman charging towards him with a dagger in an icepick grip. He let loose an arrow at her head, but she ducked under it. <i>Drat.</i> She was closing in fast. He paced backward and fired again. The second arrow hit true, burying itself deep in her chest. He lazily sidestepped her stumbling body and fired another shot into the back of her skull, killing her instantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was never a good idea to let your enemies die on their own time, if you could help it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned to see four more bandits prowling his way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link instinctively tossed his bow aside, drawing his sword. He drew upon his red affinity for good measure, feeling his magic ignite within his veins. The world slowed to a crawl as his senses sharpened and his muscles tensed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nearest bandit charged and swung at him with a cudgel. Link knocked the weapon aside with ease and dispatched the woman with a single downward strike through her solar plexus. She crumpled to the ground, clutching her gushing wound. Link sidestepped a thrust from a man with a spear, then closed the distance with two quick strides and drove his sword straight into the man’s heart.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was about it for his reserves. He eased back on his magic as he pulled his sword free, bringing it up to guard as he spun back around. The remaining two bandits balked and ran, but Grenja pursued and caught one of them from behind. The massive titan of a man held the struggling bandit by the neck from the rear, and after a swift strike to the back of the head, let a limp corpse fall to the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, the last fleeing bandit slipped and caught a protruding ice crystal to the throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah,” Grenja said. “That wasn’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two of them turned as they heard the unmistakable sound of a horse galloping towards them from the far side of the camp. The rider yelled out something unintelligible and brandished what looked like a ten-foot pole.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finally! There was something Link had been itching to try for a long time now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, can you compel that horse? Have it buck its rider.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes, Master.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The horse reared back with a mighty winny, bucking around wildly. Its rider struggled to hold on, but eventually fell from the saddle and dropped his weapon—if it could be called that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Nice,</i>” Grenja said. He promptly jogged up, grabbed the pole, and broke it in half over the rider’s head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, save some for me next time!” Koja called out as she sauntered into camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seriously,” Ryn said, pulling up close behind. “The patrols didn’t even notice me. <i>Boring.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ooh. Hey, Ryn!” Koja said conspiratorially. “You know what we should try next time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes! I like what you’re thinking. Gotta keep these bandits on their toes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The girls giggled. Grenja groaned. “Ugh, not this again,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?” Link looked quizzically between the trio.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Trust me, you don’t want to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—He’s just jealous,” Ryn said. “He’s always had issues with this one because he lacks the required assets.” She struck a seductive pose and cupped her chest suggestively. “It’s called the <i>Bathing Assassin</i>. It’s where you strip butt naked and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Would you two quit fooling around? We’re still on a mission.” Grenja said. “Link, you want to rest up here, or head back to camp?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link cleared his throat, turning his head away. He—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww, he’s blushing!” Koja said. She turned to Ryn. “See? I told you he was a softie. Pay up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Mother-ficking bitch,</i>” Ryn grumbled, reaching into her pouch and pulling out a red rupee. “You tricked me!” She chucked the rupee at Koja’s head. Koja snatched it clean out of the air with an impish grin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head, doing his best to overlook Ryn’s casual use of appallingly blasphemous profanity. And also Grenja’s nonchalance at the prospect of resting in the middle of a pile of dead bodies and the general blood-soaked carnage they had wrought upon the bandit camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey guys, come look at this!” Grenja said. “There’s a big pile of rupees over here in this tent!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sighed. It was going to be a long journey.</span>
