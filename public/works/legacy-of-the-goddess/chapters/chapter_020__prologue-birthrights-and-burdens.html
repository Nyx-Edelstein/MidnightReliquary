<span>Ari couldn’t sleep. Nightmares, as usual. And so, he found himself sitting atop a guard tower at the southeastern edge of the castle grounds, preparing a meal by the firepit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was raining, and that helped. Ari found comfort in the rain. It wasn’t a particularly heavy rain—rather, the steady drizzle characteristic of the last few weeks of Storms. The soft patter all about, the low rumblings in the distance, and the gentle tapping on the roof above put his mind at ease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It almost drowned out the sounds of boisterous soldiers playing cards a floor below.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was not his place to criticize, but he couldn’t help but feel that most of the city guard didn’t take their duty very seriously. He was off-duty himself (and technically not part of the guard besides), but he didn’t have anything else to do in town. Might as well do something marginally useful with his time. If nothing else, he took solace in the routine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At this hour, amid the first stirrings of dawn, not much was visible save for other guard towers and a few dozen islands of light along the walkways and walls. The lampposts glowed rather than flickered; the steady light of Red magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unbidden, his mind flashed to images of bloodthirsty Blin charging on armored boars across an open field at dusk, eyes and steel glowing with that same red tinge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shook himself from the images, trying to focus on his meal. The food here in Castletown was much better than the rations back in Talus. Roasted tubers and boiled cassal eggs with oxgoat cheese and sourmilk. He’d take this over hardtack and jerky any day.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He watched along the walls as he enjoyed his meal in solitude. Mentally, he noted pathways to and from the castle, the patrols and their timings, and their positioning relative to other manned guard towers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just as he was finishing up he heard a call from below—“High Captain in command! At arms!”—followed by clamoring of feet and metal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uncle Raolin?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari hurried to clean up, tossing his leavings into the fire. He hadn’t thought his uncle would be out so early, or he wouldn’t have come here. A minute or so passed as he waited anxiously, trying to make out the indistinct sounds of conversation between his uncle and the sergeant on duty.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At last the hatch opened and High Captain Raolin made his way up. He was clad in full officer’s regalia; a tight fitting blue coat hemmed in gold and bearing the winged-shield crest of the City Guard. A cane clacked against the stone with every other step, with Raolin slightly favoring his left leg. Ari couldn’t help but note he had gained weight in the three years since they had last met.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stood and saluted, right hand in a fist over his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin smirked.“At ease, son. You’re not on duty here, and you’re not under my command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sir.” Ari dropped his salute and stood at ease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin laughed and shook his head. He took two steps forward and held his arms outstretched. He met Ari’s eyes and cocked his head to one side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari relented and stepped into his uncle’s embrace. Raolin pulled him in with a firm squeeze, then stepped back with a hearty guffaw, placing a hand on his shoulder. “Goddesses, look at you,” he beamed. “All grown up! You get any taller and I’ll be the one looking up to you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari couldn’t help but smile at his uncle’s simple but earnest affection. “I missed you, Uncle. How’s city life treating you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah!” Raolin said, genuine mirth in his eyes. “Getting that scratch was the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Now I get to sit in on Council meetings, have a dozen Lieutenants clambering to lick my boots…” He trailed off, following Ari’s gaze. “Can’t say I much enjoy the paperwork, though.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari wasn’t sure how best to respond, so he just stood quietly, nodding. He never really imagined Raolin as the city type. He was glad to hear his uncle was doing well, though.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin frowned. “What are you doing out here, anyway? I know you got in late—you should be sleeping. Something bothering you?” He led the way to the benches nearby and took a seat, taking off his gloves and warming his hands by the fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari hesitated, searching for the right words as he took a seat on the bench. “It’s… complicated,” he said at last. He wasn’t keen on rehashing his thoughts yet again. Lately everyone seemed overly concerned about him, and he didn’t want to add his uncle to the list.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve seen it all, son,” Raolin said earnestly. “Try me. Why don’t you start with your last skirmish?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He knew that was coming. “It was a bad one,” Ari began with a sigh. “We tracked a small band that slipped past patrols through the passes and into the basin. They were headed straight for Jarrensvale, but turned south just before we caught up.” He paused, discomfort rising within. Raolin said nothing, only motioning for Ari to continue. He did.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I lost five of my men. None of them died in the fighting. We actually routed them despite it all—even had healers on hand. But… their wounds…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bloodrage,” his uncle spat, rubbing at his leg. “Damn those curs to the Void. It’s not a pretty way to go, not by a damn sight. I’m sorry you had to see that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not that,” Ari said, shaking his head. He wondered how much to say. “That was horrible, but I’ve seen it before. We all know what our duty means.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin nodded solemnly. He motioned as if to say “go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari felt the words spilling out before he could stop them, distant and detached, as if watching himself from afar. “It didn’t have to happen like that. I could’ve saved them,” he said, voice barely above a whisper. “Something was off. The smells were wrong—it didn’t smell like they’d actually camped that night. I didn’t know what it meant at the time, but I didn’t like it. My second insisted the intel was good, that we were in a strong position. Said I was being paranoid. I didn’t want to argue, so I gave the order.” He paused, the weight of it settling over him. “But I was right. Twice their number were waiting for us in the mountains. It was an ambush.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin crossed his arms, mouth drawing to a line. “I read the report, son. Ambush or no, you made the right call, and likely saved a lot of lives.” He shook his head. “Losing men who died at your orders? It’s rough. But it happens to the best of us. You can’t blame yourself, and I won’t watch you beat yourself up over it. Trust me, son, it could’ve been a lot worse.” A flash of concern, worry, and an uneasy smile. “But it wasn’t, and <i>you</i> are to thank for that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. I mean, I know,” Ari said, coming back to himself. Hearing praise always made him uncomfortable, even when it came from his uncle. But it wasn’t about the skirmish. That ate at him, but there was more to it. His uncle wasn’t seeing it. Why didn’t anyone else see it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s just—that wasn’t the first time,” Ari said. “Only the worst. It’s worrying. They’re too organized. There’s been more and more reports like that lately. You’ve seen them too, haven’t you?” He hesitated. He might as well just say it. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say they’re feeling out our defenses, gathering information. I fear the worst.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin’s expression went flat. “You think there’s a Warlord,” he said. “Son, if they had a Warlord leading them, they wouldn’t bother with anything but a straight assault with overwhelming force. You know that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari gazed back over the grounds. Lieutenant Averil had said much the same—that it was nothing new, nothing unexpected. She’d even ordered him to spend a fortnight reading history before bothering her again, much to his embarrassment. Still, it didn’t add up. The Blin <i>were</i> too organized, even if he couldn’t explain why. He understood their perspective—a couple dozen more deaths than usual over the past year was hardly cause for alarm. But they weren’t there like he was!</span>
<br><br>
<span>He could feel his uncle watching him. The silence stretched on, heavy and uncomfortable. Uncle Raolin knew him better than anyone—knew when to give him space and when to push. But the weight of that scrutiny pressed down on Ari, smothering his thoughts before they could take shape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari turned back to the guard patrols. He pointed off to the side, desperate to change the subject. “See that? There’s a timing gap.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A what?” Raolin looked to where Ari was pointing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A gap,” Ari said. “Every five or six minutes, there’s about a twelve second gap in the guard patrols… <i>there,</i> that isn’t covered by any manned towers. At least at this hour.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin grunted, seeming unconcerned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, I could probably slip through there if I wanted,” Ari offered. “It would be nothing for a trained assassin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Arlinkar…” Raolin said, gaping at him in disbelief. “We’re in <i>Castletown</i>!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari winced at the use of his full name. He made to respond, but turned away, flustered. There was nothing he could do to salvage it now. <i>Stupid…</i> He knew better than to let thoughts like that slip. People tended to get the wrong idea about his mental state when he talked like that, and he was already under enough scrutiny as it was. He couldn’t help but let his guard down around his uncle, though.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin stammered, running his hand through his hair. “Ari, listen to yourself! Who would do such a thing? We haven’t been at war with the Akhari for over a thousand years. Why in the name of the Holy Mother Above would we be worried about <i>assassins</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The King—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Veilwyrd are looking into the King,” Raolin said, cutting him off. “And if they suspected anything, I would be the first to know.” A pause. “As it happens, they say it to be a natural illness.” Pause. “Besides, why would someone send assassins after the fact? That would be absurd.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something about his uncle’s words didn’t sit right with him. A natural illness—that’s what everyone kept saying. But Ari had done his research, consulted with the oldest and most experienced healers he could find. No records of anything like it. None of them had ever seen anything similar. And now that he thought about it—would his uncle even tell him if the Veilwyrd had found something? Would the <i>Veilwyrd</i> tell anyone at all?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari sat still. He didn’t like that tone. He didn’t like where this was going.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari, look at me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did so. Raolin placed a hand on his shoulder, eyes red-rimmed. It pained Ari to see him like that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Son, you’re far too young to be carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. I can’t stand seeing you like this. They told me it was bad, but I didn’t realize it was this bad.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s eyes narrowed. “I’m fine, Uncle.” He stood and stepped away, turning to hide his frustration. “I just need some time to clear my head, is all. I know I’ve been through a lot, but I can handle it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin muttered something under his breath that Ari didn’t catch. “I won’t mince words,” he said. “You deserve that much. Your guard detail assignment for the envoy was a pretense. They didn’t think you’d take kindly to being discharged, and didn’t want to risk what you might do on hearing the news. So they sent you back to me instead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s suspicions were confirmed. “So that’s it, then?” he snapped, his heart pounding in his ears. He was not one to question orders, but everything about the envoy mission had been wrong from the start. He’d thought they were simply sending him away again to “unwind,” but this? How could they?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin stood and hobbled over, leaning heavily on his cane as he came to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ari. Ari glanced at him and saw all the years of age written plainly on his uncle’s face. Try as he might, he found it hard to hold on to his anger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin took a slow, measured breath. “Son, I know how important this is to you. Your heart is in the right place. But you can’t burn yourself out like this. You’ve been on duty for <i>seven years</i> without reprieve! You’re jumping at shadows. No one serves in the field that long, and for good reason. You know that. Most only go a year at a time, and spend twice as long back home between rotations. What you’re doing is <i>insane.</i> Talus has stood for hundreds of years before you, and it will continue to stand after you. There are many, many others to shoulder this burden.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari had nothing to say to that. His uncle wasn’t <i>wrong</i>, and he knew the concern was genuine. Still, it gnawed at him. There had to be more he could do—more he <i>should</i> do. To protect those who couldn’t protect themselves, like the Lightsworn of old. That was his calling! What did sacrifice matter if it meant fulfilling his purpose? He bore the burden so others wouldn’t have to. How could they ask him to abandon what Avalia herself had ordained?</span>
<br><br>
<span>His uncle stirred next to him, scratching at his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah! Before I forget, I wanted to give you something,” Raolin said, fishing a necklace out from under his coat. He unclasped it and held it in his palm. He looked distant, as if reminiscing on an old memory. “It’s an old family heirloom,” he said. He turned the necklace over in his palm before passing it to Ari. “Your grandfather gave it to me, and his father to him. It should be yours now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari hesitantly took the necklace and examined it. A simple thing: a jagged golden shard on a thin chain. There was something about it, though—something he couldn’t quite place. It felt <i>right</i> in his hands, in a way he couldn’t explain. “Thank you, Uncle,” he said, his gaze transfixed on the object.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They say it brings fortune and good luck to whoever wears it,” Raolin said, tapping his cane against his leg. “I’m not sure I believe all that, but I’m still standing despite everything, so maybe there’s some truth to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded and clasped the chain behind his neck. For a moment, his thoughts seemed to scatter—what had he been thinking about just now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey,” Raolin said with a pat to the back. “Cheer up—there’s good news. I pulled some strings, and got you a position in the Royal Guard.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari looked to his uncle, askance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin held up a hand. “Now before you say no, hear me out. This is a <i>prestigious position</i>—it will open doors for you. Young men your age would kill for the chance. They’re highly selective.” He managed to look smug despite himself. “But given your service history, it was an easy enough sell.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Royal Guard,” Ari said testily. “You want me to be a glorified doormat?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin gave a dramatic sigh and slouched. Ari looked away. He didn’t like disappointing his uncle, but he could also tell when he was being manipulated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, come now. It’s not as bad as that,” Raolin said. “You’ll have plenty of opportunities to get out. Princess Xayla is rather fond of excursions around the countryside—increasingly so, as of late.” He paused, a glint in his eye. “Now that I think about it, she’s always going on about her ’research’ and ’experiments,’ convinced her ideas will revolutionize the world. Fix everything.” A knowing smile crossed his face. “I think you two would get along <i>splendidly</i>. And who knows?” He jabbed Ari’s side playfully, winking and wagging his eyebrows.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncle…” Ari protested, feeling heat rise to his face. He looked away, but not before Raolin saw. With a chuckle, his uncle threw an arm around his shoulders and ruffled his hair. Ari ducked free of the grapple, smoothing down his hair and rolling his eyes. Now wasn’t the time for such foolishness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Promise me you’ll at least think about it, yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded before he could catch himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Great!” Raolin bellowed, tapping his cane against the floor. “I’ll let Vian know right away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, I didn’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll schedule a meeting for you in a few hours,” Raolin called over his shoulder. To Ari’s horror, he had already turned to leave and was heading back down the steps. “Oh, and one more thing. You’re to take the day off. That means actually try and relax. No training, no patrolling, and for the love of the Mother: no brooding. And come by for dinner tonight! Those are orders.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncle!” Ari stammered, calling after him. “I thought I wasn’t under your command!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>His uncle laughed, turning back just as he disappeared below the hatch. “You are now, son!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stood bewildered as the hatch swung shut with a clack. His shoulders slumped in defeat and he took a long, measured breath. He had a lot to think about, and honestly had no idea what to do next.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It couldn’t be too bad, he told himself. Uncle Raolin had always looked out for him.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla rushed to sit at her study, belatedly reviewing her notes in preparation for the meeting with Sage Amaran in—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Three knocks sounded at the door to the hallway below, echoing softly against the walls. Xayla motioned frantically to her handmaiden with raised eyebrows for emphasis. To her relief, Anli was already halfway down the stairs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That girl was worth her weight in crysts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rose from her study, flipping through her notes and scanning them with rapidity in preparation for the meeting with Sage Amaran in a-few-seconds-ago. She ducked behind a bookcase to buy herself an extra few-seconds-ago.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She really needed to plan better. Her schedule these days…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A slow creak. Echoing voices. Footsteps. The voices drew near and became more distinct. </span>
<br><br>
<span><i>“… hospitality … not expecting … but asked me to accompany him to meet with the Princess today.”</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait, was that <i>Counselor Taetus?</i> What in the blighted ruins was he doing here?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Splendid! I am sure Her Grace will be excited as ever to see you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla silently prayed to Avalia that her snort of laughter didn’t give away her position.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Would either of you like some tea?” Anli asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, thank you.” / “None for me today.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla closed her notebook and set it on an empty shelf, hurrying to meet with her guests. It was considered rude, even insulting to keep guests waiting for any length of time, especially when the host had arranged the meeting. As it was, she was already straining the limits of propriety.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. I shall go and fetch Her Grace. Please, make yourself comfortable.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah! No need, Anli.” Xayla curtsied and made her way down the stairs. “Sage Amaran, I am most delighted to meet with you today.” What <i>was</i> Taetus doing here? “And Counselor Taetus! I was not expecting your company.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Anli curtsied and dismissed herself. Amaran bowed his head towards Xayla, and Taetus bowed much lower.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The pleasure is mine, Your Grace,” Amaran said with the practiced ease of a venerable and highly-regarded man. “I asked the Counselor here today to… ah…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Holiness, if you please. Allow me.” Taetus offered. Amaran nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, forgive my intrusion,” Taetus began, with the practiced ease of a pompous, serpent-tongued vermin. “The Sage asked me here today to see that the expense reports presented to the Council are accurate, and that you are properly informed of the impediments to your projects.” He raised an eyebrow. “Those being mostly fiscal in nature.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla forced herself to maintain composure, clasping her hands cordially and offering nothing but a radiant smile. Inwardly, she contemplated what would happen if she obliterated this wretched fool here and now. It would be so easy. A single Burst projected into a sheet of razor-sharp ice would sever his greedy, duplicitous, conniving—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is—ah—not as bad as the Counselor implies, Your Grace,” Amaran said. “I have plenty of good news to share. It’s just that… well.” He shifted uncomfortably. “Perhaps we should move to discussions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, let’s,” Xayla replied, perhaps too quickly. She tore her eyes away and motioned to the table that had been prepared for their meeting. She led the way, and they followed. “Are you sure you wouldn’t be interested in some tea?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She motioned to Anli as they walked. Turning away to ensure her eyes were hidden from view, she projected a single word telepathically to her handmaiden. <i>Nightshade.</i> Xayla had every expectation that this would be a stressful meeting. Best to ensure her nerves remained calm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace is most considerate, but I am quite alright,” Taetus said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaran made to decline, but reconsidered. “Ahh… yes actually. Thank you. Tea sounds lovely.” He raised his voice in courtesy to the serving girl. “Ginger and honey?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The trio took their seats. Xayla recalled her notes and decided to open with the topic that interested her most—better to get the worst over with quickly, should the results prove disappointing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So,” she chirped. “To business, then? Shall we start with the Blindscrier project?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Blindscriers.</i> She was quite fond of the name—her own of course. The idea itself was simple, though the execution and implications of its use were more involved. Rather than requiring trained Blue mages to operate communication lines between towns with use of Scrying and Telepathy, Blindscriers required only a focused light source atop a tower. Patterns of open and closed blinds in front of the light, together with a clever encoding scheme, could be used to relay messages near instantaneously across distances comparable to Scrying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(The idea for the encoding scheme itself was the result of painstaking historical research, meticulous cross-checking of references, and a fair amount of inference from incomplete records. Even then she only knew what she had found due to her talent in the abstract philosophies.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Brilliant. Absolutely, magnificently, <i>brilliant</i>. With Blindscriers—and <i>a bit</i> of setup cost—they could expand the communication networks to every single village and hamlet throughout the kingdom, rather than just between the largest towns and military outposts as was currently done. The increased efficiency in trade would more than pay for the costs in time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah yes, excellent, most excellent,” Amaran began, visibly composing his thoughts. In old age, his mind was as sharp as ever, though it took more care to wield.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Blindscriers, yes. The design proved to be simple enough. As I thought, there were quite a few issues with transcription mistakes being propagated and compounded at first, but after applying your suggestions on redundancy and cross-checking, the errors were wholly eliminated, at the expense of roughly doubled transmission time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still assuredly impressive, most impressive,” he added after a pause. “I am also pleased to inform you that every operator in the initial groups managed passable scores on transmission and transcription with two weeks’ training. It is not as fast or as accurate as scrying—ah… but it gets the job done.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla allowed herself a moment of self-congratulation, even as she could feel the “but” looming ominously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But… ah… well…“ he began, drumming his fingers at the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus cut in, clearing his throat. “Your Grace, allow me to summarize. I understand your plan is for the Crown to finance clearing, construction, supply, training, upkeep,“ he ticked off fingers individually, then spread his hand wide, ”…and other costs upfront, to be repaid in time with funds appropriated from tariffs after your predicted increases in mercantilism and intervillage commerce.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pause for dramatic effect. Yes, that was the plan. Xayla had to fight not to tap her foot or roll her eyes. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Allow me to be blunt. The reality of the situation is that, in light of recent efforts, we cannot afford such a monolithic expenditure on the basis of speculation.” He gestured dramatically for emphasis, as he was wont to do. “Keeping the communication towers supplied and safe from fiends is the bulk of the cost. I’m afraid we simply cannot afford to do this at scale.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla cocked her head. <i>That</i> was his objection? “Counselor Taetus. Was it not the plan to cut back operations to what we can presently afford, prioritizing areas by population and expected returns, and scaling the network as funds allowed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus balked, mild annoyance crossing his face. “Your Grace, with respect, I do not believe you grasp the true scope of this endeavor.” He reached into a pocket with a nervous laugh and unrolled a map. “As you suggest, we attempted to construct <i>a single line</i> between Jarrensvale and the largest village cluster in the floodplains, with a few deviations to connect smaller villages along the way.” His finger traced the route along the map.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But without routine caravan traffic to fight back on fiend encroachment, once we withdrew the initial taskforce and began operation, five of the towers were abandoned within a week despite our best efforts.” He tapped the five locations on the map. “All told, <i>eighteen</i> workers suffered wounds requiring medical treatment, and one very nearly died. To speak nothing of supply shrinkage and general logistical inefficiency due to travel routes being not-at-all maintained.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla clenched her jaw and crossed her arms, not bothering to mask her frustration. If this project were to succeed, it would make sense to connect villages in the largest unincorporated population center with the second largest town at the earliest opportunity. But at the same time, it also had to be the longest, most costly of possible lines to construct. If it was anything but certain, why start there? She wasn’t sure whether to suspect malice or incompetence, but either way she now faced an uphill battle in arguing the project’s merits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus gave an exaggerated frown and looked to Amaran. Xayla’s attention followed. Amaran met the frown with one of his own, nodding solemnly. The old sage’s gaze fixed back to his hands resting on his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Oh, that was dirty. So now he was playing Amaran against her too? Money was one thing, but now it was <i>personal</i>. Until now she had always inspired confidence in the Lorekeepers, and had Amaran’s ear in particular. Amaran! Her own mentor!</span>
<br><br>
<span>The thought occurred to her that Sage Amaran might not have asked Taetus here to begin with, except for Taetus’ scheming. Of course, Xayla couldn’t say as much, but the pattern fit too closely to be dismissed out of hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She would need to tread carefully, lest all of her <i>lofty, ill-advised projects</i> be curtailed in the name of <i>practicality</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus continued. “It is most unfortunate, Your Grace, but we cannot increase the number of operators without also increasing logistical costs beyond any reasonable expectation of sustainability. And stationing Green mages, or even specialized forces along the lines would be counterproductive to say the least. Need I remind you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You <i>need not</i> remind me, Counselor,” Xayla interrupted. She was all-too aware her poise was slipping, and so took a moment to relax with a calm, measured breath. “Forgive me. Only, I did not anticipate such difficulties.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My apologies, Your Grace. I did not intend offense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla steepled her hands in thought. There had to be some way to recover this. “Can we increase taxes to cover the costs, and shift priority towards the least-costly lines to set up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus smile-frowned with a minute but rather pointed shake of his head. He dove into her query without missing a beat. “No, Your Grace. We cannot increase taxes at present. After two years of poor harvests, many farms are struggling to subsist, necessitating reductions in taxes if anything. An increase would likely lead to widespread insurrection. Perhaps if we are blessed with good harvests this year, and yields return to historical averages?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pause as he let the words settle. “But even if that were not the case, it would not begin to cover the deficit in labor we would need to see towers adequately supplied and cleared at any scale. The project’s feasibility is predicated on paying for itself in time, and with that approach we would very nearly maximize operating costs prior to any possibility of returns. And before you ask: we cannot spare forces from Talus, and both Avalia’s Watch and Last Bastion are operating at minimal capacity already.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Blessedly, Anli arrived with the tea to a pair of gracious nods as he finished. Amaran sipped at his in silence. Xayla unthinkingly downed hers in one long draught, motioning to have her cup refilled with a smile. Instant relief. The liquid was hot, but not so hot as to scorch her mouth. Anli knew her well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus observed her impassively, though he made no comment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh. Whoops.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well, to the blightlands with appearances, Xayla thought, downing the second cup and motioning for a third. Anli complied, and hurried off to brew more. Amaran very carefully did not notice the events, something in his pouches having come to occupy his attention.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Always one problem after another, after another. But so long as she kept solving problems, eventually progress would be made. <i>Eventually.</i> Her blessing was also her curse, it seemed. But she needed to get ahead of this. Whatever <i>this</i> was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned her attention to Amaran. Taetus began to interject but she held up a hand, and he fell silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sage Amaran, I have a proposal,” she said. “What is your estimation of the feasibility of alternative constructions? Rather than wooden towers and encampments, we build fortified enclosures designed to eliminate the need for constant clearing. Two or three operators would live wholly inside the dwellings. Supplies would be restocked and personnel rotated through occasional resupply and relief missions, tasked to provincial Governors.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaran nodded ponderously and took a few sips of his tea. “Mmm. Interesting. Unorthodox, but interesting. Less labor needed for operation, fewer mouths to feed, less raw logistical demand. It may work, yes. It seems the balance would hinge on construction costs and upkeep. But even then, at least the costs are mostly fixed upfront. Hmm… with the right materials and methods… yes. Plausible, if surely challenging.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Counselor Taetus,” Xayla said, drawing inspiration from Father. “Please record the Crown’s formal request to divert <i>half</i> of the remaining funds currently appropriated for the Blindscrier project towards researching the viability and restrictions of fortified towers operating in isolation. Expenses to be overseen by the Lorekeepers. The remainder of the funds to be returned to the general account. I will personally work with the Lorekeepers to see these problems resolved before we resume work on the Blindscrier project.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, Your Grace. That is eminently reasonable,” Taetus said, taking notes. An infuriating grin played at the edges of his mouth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was so thoroughly absurd. The project would continue in all but name, but at least this way—being seen to concede—she would not have to fight as hard to defend the project from Taetus and the other cryst-grubbing kleptwings of the Council. If she had to, she would find some other pretense to construct the towers one at a time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Moving on.” Xayla smiled, as genuinely as she could manage. “Sage Amaran, how goes the Greenery project?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was well known that magical affinity was at least partially hereditary, with affinity being more common and more potent among noble lineages. Xayla, being of royal blood, could trace her lineage back to Avalia herself, and thus had every affinity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Technically. Red magic was still difficult for her.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Confoundingly, however, attempts to breed for stronger magical affinities—or increase their prevalence by joining noble bloodlines—always fell short. It was as if the Goddesses themselves were watching, refusing to bestow any more of their divinity than they deemed fit. The Faith maintained that magical affinity was a blessing from the Goddesses, and that those marked with their favor were destined for greatness. Xayla wasn’t certain what to make of that claim, though she supposed they had reason enough for the belief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At any rate, it seemed they had overlooked certain types of vegetation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Using Green magic, one could channel healing energies into some fruits, tubers, and other crops. The results varied wildly, but some species would grow faster, produce larger fruits, or become more resilient to pests and disease. Xayla’s idea was simple: cultivate these traits intentionally, and increase harvests. She wasn’t sure why it wasn’t done already, though her historical research suggested magical horticulture might be one of many arts lost to time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, yes. Good, good. Most delightful.” Amaran sipped at his tea. Anli appeared to refill his cup just as it was running low, earning her a grateful smile. “The most recent batch shows yields between one-quarter and one-third higher than ordinary cultivars.” He scratched at his beard. “However, we’ve seen no improvement over the previous batch. …Nor the one before that, as you are aware.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother! She had been so certain she’d solved that one. The yields still weren’t high enough to justify dedicating Green mages to the work, though she remained convinced they would improve with time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How unfortunate,” Xayla replied with a sigh. “Well, there is always next year.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I may interject, Your Grace.” Tateus. Xayla nodded, though perhaps too curtly. At least she remembered to smile this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Might I suggest reducing the scope of this project?” His voice took on a nauseating affectation. Did he honestly think her as easily swayed as the bootlicking politicians vying to see which one could shove their nose furthest—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Temporarily, of course. At least until you are able to make further progress in your research. As you well know, there are many demands on Crown finances. However mundane, it is still necessary to insure caravans and maintain infrastructure. And the magic can—at least at present—be better used for Healing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps it was the nightshade affecting her mood, but Xayla found her anger fading. He did have a point. Still, scaling back would introduce more variability within batches, making it harder to determine whether she had made any progress at all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then again, she could play his game just as well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sage Amaran?” Xayla inquired, rolling her cup in hand. “What are your thoughts on the matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm? Oh, yes. A tough one,” Amaran replied, drawing out the words. “The project does have astounding potential, and the older records do hint at precedent. Though even if you are successful, there still remains the problem of magical scarcity. In truth, I cannot say. I leave matters of decision and policy in more capable hands, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sat back in her seat, crossing her legs. So much for that. In truth, she simply didn’t have time for further research—not with everything else demanding her attention. Still, no need to give Taetus the satisfaction. Let him think he’d won another victory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. We will put this project on hiatus for now. Please record the Crown’s formal request to return the funds to the general account.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched as Taetus took note while sipping her tea. To her surprise, she found the cup empty and Anli at her side offering her more. When had that happened? She shook her head, passing the cup along. She might have overdone it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Splendid news indeed, Your Grace,” Taetus said mirthlessly. “Though High Captain Thurdan informs us that, while assuredly impressive, Talus has no need for the siege engines at present. He says they are best suited to assaulting static fortifications. And while they may have been of great use historically, the devices cannot be used effectively against the Blin hordes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. When had they moved to discussing siege engines?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaran nodded as he composed his response, with notably more vigor than before. “The prototype was constructed to specification, yes. It required a bit of trial and error and took a few iterations to get the gearworks right. But as per your sources, a single soldier could wind and operate the device… ah, though with some effort.” He met Xayla’s gaze with a glint in his eye. “I am pleased to report: it worked. Clean across the field!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh?” Xayla heard herself say. It was like she was watching the conversation unfold from a few seconds away, present in body but not in mind, her vision morphing and snapping in waves. Events were jumbling in her awareness, arriving out of order; an effect of acute nightshade poisoning. She really did overdo it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She knew it was harmless, however. The best course of action was simply to observe without interfering. Interference would only worsen things. Xayla would handle herself well enough, though perhaps she should find a reason to end the meeting sooner rather than later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes… quite.” Taetus replied, doing a poor job of hiding his frustration. He scribbled notes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Or perhaps not. Sooner, yes. Sooner would be better.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sage Amaran, what of the siege engines? Did the smiths find my sketches workable?” Xayla heard herself ask. She affectionately traced a hand along Anli’s arm as the girl turned to leave. Anli’s eyes went wide and her cheeks red in surprise, though the men did not seem to take note.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was not appropriate. Xayla shook her head, trying to focus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Remarkable devices, yes. Truly remarkable. And… ah, terrifying to behold. Are you well, Your Grace?” Amaran looked to Xayla, showing concern.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Splendid! That is splendid news indeed!” Xayla heard herself say with far more enthusiasm than warranted. She was even waving her hands about. How embarrassing. Was that her reaction to Amaran’s report?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, of course,” Xayla said, though the words seemed to echo strangely in her ears. She struggled to maintain focus. “I wasn’t certain the designs would be complete, given the fragmentary nature of the sources. I’m pleased they proved workable.” Heat rose to her face, and she tried to dismiss it with a wave. “I assure you. I am fine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaran nodded dutifully, content to accept her answer. Taetus simply smiled. Who knew what that man was thinking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. What a pity,” Xayla heard herself say, adopting a mock frown. “Such a pity. Well. On the bright side, fewer expenses to worry about—as I’m certain you’ll be pos-it-ively <i>elated</i> to note, Counselor Taetus.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaran took the lull as an opportunity to speak up. “Your Grace, perhaps we should continue at another time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, perhaps that would be best,” Xayla said, rising from her seat. “Thank you for your time, Sage. As always, it was a pleasure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The men hastened to rise to meet her. Amaran bowed his head. Taetus stammered. “A pleasure as always, Your Grace!” he called after her, as she hurried up the stairs and away to her bedchamber.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“At arms, soldier,” Nira commanded as she entered the courtyard. A boy in Talus green—the newest recruit for the Royal Guard—snapped to arms with a salute. Good form.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waved to the guards on duty. “Dismissed.” They saluted, clearing the courtyard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira took a moment to assess the boy. Lean and fit, with a keen air about him. A bit on the younger side—which was what interested her most. Otherwise unremarkable, save for his background. She glanced at the notes set out for her on a nearby table. Nephew of High Captain Raolin. Years of heroic service, honorably discharged when he became more of a liability than an asset.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At ease. Your skills?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shifted into a comfortable stance. “Ma’am. Tactical operations and reconnaissance. Primarily horseback, archery, and swordsmanship. Minor magical support; Green. Baseline affinity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Qualifications?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seven years’ service at Talus. Squadron leader.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Twenty-two years old with seven years of service? That kind of experience at his age, with such varied skillset, spoke to exceptional innate talent. He was driven—good. She could use that. Had he been born with a second affinity, or if his Green magic ran stronger, the Veilwyrd would have already claimed him. As it stood, the world had precious little room for those like him. A pity he hadn’t been born in another age.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Words could only say so much. She would need to test his mettle herself. A mock fight—she wouldn’t go full force.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira paced around his back to a training rack at the opposite side of the small courtyard. She selected a blunted sword and tossed it to him from behind. “Defend yourself!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just as the sword left her hands, she fell into a crouch. A torrent of Red magic swirled in the air and coursed through her veins, augmenting her strength and pushing her reflexes well past her natural ability. The world slowed down as her senses sped up. She kicked against the ground, launching herself at her target. Gathering energy crackled in her palms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With surprising alacrity, the boy pivoted in place, snatching the sword from the air by the barest margin. Luck; he was a Green mage after all. In the same motion, he used the momentum of his turn to coil on his right leg, leaping free of Nira’s charge. She missed him by mere inches.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira dug into the ground, arresting her momentum. She turned and— the maneuver had left him in position! Clearly, she underestimated him. She dropped into form and readied herself to counter his next attack with everything she had.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He swung his sword in an arc to deny her space. His next move would be to step in and follow through with a diagonal cut from above. To his credit, his form was flawless. But Nira had drilled against this technique a thousand times. A light Burst to deflect the blade, then she’d drive into him from below with a rising—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Faster than she could react—faster than she could even <i>think</i>—the boy shifted. He lunged forward, using the impact of her Burst to redirect the blade mid-air and draw the blunted edge against her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took her a full second to gather her wits. What had she just witnessed? <i>No one</i> had reflexes that fast. By the time she recovered, the boy had already settled back into stance, his sword leveled at her neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira stepped back, heart pounding. “I yield.” She bowed in acknowledgement of a superior opponent. What was—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lady Veilwyrd!” a voice called from behind. “A message!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira turned to find a courier waiting at the courtyard entrance. “Well done,” she said to the new recruit, half-distracted. “Excellent display.” She waved the courier forward and accepted the message.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, ma’am. Thank you,” the boy said, standing at ease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira broke the seal and scanned the letter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, for the love of—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Urgent news,” she said, turning to leave. “Go with the guard. They’ll see you properly outfitted. You’ll receive your official orders in the morning.” She tossed a blue cryst towards a random guard on her way out of the courtyard, who caught it with a gleam in his eye. “You—pass along my commendation.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Are you clear of mind?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Near enough</i>, came Xayla’s reply.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Outside.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Results?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Outside. Now.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A tense, formless rage boiled in Nira’s chest, red and angry as the evening sun. She could do nothing about it, which only made it worse. She waited impatiently at Princess Xayla’s balcony.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside, she heard giggling laughter and rustling fabric. One set of footsteps approached the balcony, while another set moved toward the hallway door with a creak and a clack. The curtains drew back and Xayla opened the latch, cracking the glass door open and peering through while clutching her nightgown.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira shot her a look.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?” Xayla asked, rolling her eyes. She pushed the door open a few inches wider and stepped back inside, taking a seat next to the hearth. “It’s not like Father’s going to chastise me. And besides, no one else cares.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira followed her in, closing the door and drawing the curtains back. She then turned on Xayla, one hand on her hip.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla raised her chin in defiance, eyes narrowing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira raised an eyebrow, lips drawing to a line.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla blushed, looking away. She crossed her arms and threw one leg over the other.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira glared her displeasure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A tense silence hung between them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla broke first. “That bad, is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira grunted. “You’ve made quite the mess this time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll make up something,” Xayla said, waving a hand dismissively. “I’ll tell them it’s the stress getting to me. That I’m worried about Father.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s been four months,” Nira replied tersely. By the Mother Above, this girl had the most brilliant mind in the kingdom—how she could be so daft at the same time, only the Goddesses knew.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla snatched up the pillow beside her and buried her face in it to muffle a scream. Once finished, she wound back and hurled it into the hearth. The fire roared to life, consuming the pillow with furious crackling. A wave of heat washed over them. Nira had to admit it was somewhat satisfying to watch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waited for the flames to die down. “Taetus made the case that you were presently unfit for rule,” she said. “There were talks of declaring an interregnum.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla scoffed. “Nonsense. That man may be a blight upon the kingdom, but the Council would never do such a thing. Father would—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Your father is as good as dead, Princess.” Nira said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do not interrupt me, Nira!” Xayla bit back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira stepped forward and loomed over her charge, arms crossed. Xayla shrunk back, hiding her face in her hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess,” Nira said. “You ordered me to always be straight with you, in all things. To speak the truth, <i>even when inconvenient</i>. To never let you overrule me on the basis of authority alone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s defiance crumbled. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, tears welling in her eyes. “I know. I just—I’m sorry, Nira.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira took a slow breath, holding it until her frustration settled. The Princess clearly wasn’t quite herself yet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A fleeting thought crossed her mind. On a whim, Nira voiced it before the moment passed. “Do not <i>apologize</i> to me, Princess,” she said sternly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla chortled despite herself, fighting back laughter as she wiped her eyes. “Stop that,” she said. “This is serious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Princess. Very serious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla groaned. Nira permitted herself a brief grin—a reward for her complete, yet magnanimous, victory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sighed wistfully. “Do you think they’ll do it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>During an interregnum, the Royal Council could lawfully appoint a regent to rule in the monarch’s stead; either the King’s Law or the King’s Justice in time of peace, or the Lord General in time of war. To be sure, there was no precedent for the current situation. The King was suffering from an unknown affliction from which it seemed he might never recover, and Xayla refused to assume the Crown despite Nira’s insistence. Declaring an interregnum would be a bold move, but not unlawful. If it came to pass, Xayla could not be crowned as Queen without another vote from the Council.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Adresin doesn’t have the spine for it,” Nira said. “But Nyllara might.” She shrugged. “It’s a real possibility—one that grows with every passing day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She and Taetus might as well be bedfellows,” Xayla said with a crude gesture. “Wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira refused to acknowledge her remark.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What should I do, Nira?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira gaped at her, dumbstruck. Brilliant, but daft as a—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not yet ready to rule,” Xayla said, exasperated. “We’ve been over this. I always thought I’d have another twenty years <i>at least</i>.” She huffed, lowering her voice to a whisper. “All those times. If Father only knew how right he was. I should have listened.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you did not, and yet here you are,” Nira said. “You cannot change the past, Princess. You can only look towards the future.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know, I know.” She sat upright, taking in a breath. “Maybe I should abdicate.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She couldn’t be serious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked to her inquisitively.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother, she was serious. Goddesses… “No, Princess. For one, you would be giving up on your projects.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla cocked her head. “What, have we swapped places now? You know as well as I do that they aren’t going anywhere—despite my best efforts, despite what I try to tell myself. I have no talent for administration. Only <i>lofty ideas</i> and <i>naive idealism</i>.” The mocking disdain in her voice made clear what she thought of those sentiments.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked away, fidgeting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira knelt beside Xayla’s chair, resting her hands on the armrest. She couldn’t read the girl’s expression, but she had to get through to her. She had to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess, you are the light this kingdom needs,” Nira said softly. “Your father was a strong ruler, but he lacked even a fraction of your vision. You need not fear—the Council will support you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stood and stepped away. “I can’t, Nira. I’m not ready. It’s easy to have <i>vision</i>—but that doesn’t mean I know what I’m doing. My whole life I’ve neglected my training. I have no real experience. If I took the Crown now, I’d only lead the kingdom to ruin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You brilliant idiot,” Nira muttered under her breath as she rose to her feet. “Do you even listen to yourself? Since your father took ill, you’ve been having the <i>dreams</i> again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Xayla!” Her anger was building again. Nira closed the distance between them, stopping mere inches from her charge’s face. Xayla’s eyes went wide. Nira seized the bracers on Xayla’s wrists, thrusting them up before the girl’s eyes. “<i>The Avali River running backward, waves crashing against the castle. A great shadow moving across the desert and over the ocean. A mountain rising in the east, and earthquakes shattering the land!</i>” She shook Xayla by the wrists, silently pleading with the Holy Mother Above to let the girl see reason.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla pulled back. Nira released her grip. Had she gone too far?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess,” Nira said, her tone softening. “The Goddesses placed you in this position. <i>You</i>. These aren’t mere dreams—you must see that. You’re the only one who can save this kingdom. You must take the Crown and lead your people. <i>Caelon’s wisdom will guide you.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s eyes fixed on her bracers as she silently mouthed the words to herself—the bracers which held the very embodiment of that wisdom. Caelon’s Celestial Power. Fragments of the Sanctern of Mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nira,” Xayla said, drawing tall. “Come morning, gather a retinue. We’re going to visit the Caelydri.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Much later that night, Nira ducked into an alleyway under the cover of darkness. She stopped before a sturdy wooden door set into an iron frame—no handles, no obvious means of entry, save for a finger-sized hole on one side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She slipped a hooked finger into the opening and found a small pool of water within. Eyes closed, she visualized the keyform and locking mechanism. Ice crystalized from her fingertip as the form took shape, and with a faint click, the door creaked open.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside was a small, featureless room—eight feet to a side—musty and dark. She stepped through and closed the door behind her, securing it with a wooden beam. From a pouch at her side, she produced a brightly glowing stone and fitted it into a socket on her hood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A wooden trapdoor sat in the center of the room. She swung it open and descended, taking care not to slip on the mossy footholds. The sound of running water grew louder with each step down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An archway at the bottom led to a long corridor that stretched out beyond sight. Along one side of its length ran a channel leading to a cistern. Along the other were iron doors arranged at regular intervals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Indistinct voices and sordid moans rose up from the darkness as she approached. Behind the doors were holding cells where she kept the test subjects. Ancient and long-forgotten; no one knew their original purpose.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla had pleaded with her to find a cure for her father’s affliction. Since they knew nothing of the cause—save that it was anything but natural—the task involved substantial trial and error. Xayla preferred to remain oblivious to the details, maintaining a facade of ignorance and dealing only in the abstract. She was, however, happy to suggest new compound pairings and possible antidotes whenever Nira returned with the latest results.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira raised her mask to cover her nose, shielding herself from the worst of the stench. She walked along the corridor and stopped at the fourth door on the left. Inside was one of the lesser dregs society had to offer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Back already? Fickin’ sklik,” the man rasped, rattling his chains. His head drooped, half his body limp and unresponsive. He tried to spit, but his parched mouth managed only dry sputters. Dried blood caked his right wrist.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Larus.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m gonna get out o’ here,” he rapsed. “You jus’ wait. I’m gonna get out o’ here, then I’m gonna fin’ ya, and I’m gonna fick ya. I’ll fick ya real good. Then I’m gonna kill ya, and then I’m gonna fick ya again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is that so?” Nira tsked. “Then you’d best hurry. You’re almost out of time.” She unsheathed her dagger, deliberately scraping it against the casing. She could smell his fear. Her pulse quickened, blood rising as her pent-up rage transmuted to anticipation.</span>

<span>They had given it their best, but to no avail. Now, she had to clean up.</span>

He convulsed against his chains, straining and thrashing as the light dimmed in his eyes, until finally the pulsing slowed and ceased. Satisfied, Nira let his body slump lifelessly against the wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had a long night ahead.</span>
