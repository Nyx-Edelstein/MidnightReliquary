<span>Broken. Shattered. Destroyed. Not a single fragment left. They even combed the room in search of residue, hoping to find any trace of the chromatic opal, or any clue as to what became of Niesis.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla gazed out over the lake through a small window beside her bed in the monastery’s infirmary. The sun would be setting soon. She toyed with the now-inert scepter. Null assured her the item now contained no traces of magic—Divine or otherwise—and could no longer hold a charge. How could it have gone so wrong?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had been so reckless. So careless. In her haste, she utterly destroyed the most promising Ari to understanding the Fae and their connection to Avalia. Now, not only did they lose a potentially powerful ally—and a potential source of lost knowledge and secrets—but Null couldn’t even examine the artifact to determine how it worked. So much lost because of a single errant lapse of judgment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She just wanted to scream. To hurl the stupid rod through the window and out into the lake. To blast it to pieces with her magic, and let the waters carry away the debris.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But she couldn’t give in to her anger. And she knew she shouldn’t beat herself up over her folly, either. <i>Nira</i> wouldn’t have any of that, if she were here. No—she’d tell her instead to reflect. To understand her failing in its entirety, and then accept it. To move on, and do better next time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Goddess Above, how she wished Nira were here. Why couldn’t she be more like…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla let out a breath, easing her grip on the scepter. What was that saying she was so fond of? Something about the “last opportunity to avert failure?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a confluence of factors, she felt. In the moment, she wasn’t sure whether the energies Null used in the second attempt would dissipate just as before, or if the opal would even hold it’s charge long enough for them to deliberate. Ultimately, they had no way of knowing without testing it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But why had she been so hasty to use the scepter to begin with? On reflection, taking time to examine it first was obviously the correct course of action. She knew she should have waited before commanding Null to energize it a second time, but even given that… Null’s power reserves were valuable, but not <i>that valuable</i>. One of the Sages might have had information that was key to understanding it. Or perhaps there were records hidden away in the vaults that might have shed light on the nature of the item and its relationship to its creator?</span>
<br><br>
<span>If she were being honest with herself, she had to admit it was because she felt threatened. Not physically. Not personally. But in that room full of Seekers, with Vestele potentially standing in her way? She felt as if everyone knew she held only the most tenuous grasp on authority. As if, at any moment, someone would see through her farce and force her to relinquish the scepter and step aside. Deep down, some part of her believed that no one else saw the world the same way she did, and also feared that would remain the case forever. She was certainly relieved when Vestele backed down, and her insecurities played no small part in the decision to proceed carelessly at the first opportunity.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother’s mercy</i>. Vestele. Xayla certainly hadn’t done herself any favors in her eyes. Ugh. Now she just wanted to curl into a ball and hide away. Maybe if she explained herself, the priestess would understand? Or would that just cement her position in Vestele’s mind as the incompetent pretender she was?</span>
<br><br>
<span>As if summoned by her thoughts, a knock came at the door. Xayla set the scepter aside and sat at the edge of her bed. “Enter.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was not Vestele, but Ari. Xayla let out a sigh of relief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er, it’s nothing urgent," he said, peeking through the door. “I can come back tomorrow if you prefer? I just thought maybe it would help. To take your mind off things, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla smiled to herself. “Thank you. I appreciate the sentiment,” she said, gesturing to a second bed a few feet from where she sat. “Please. And you needn’t worry about me. What’s on your mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari entered, closed the door, and sat. Xayla noticed he was carrying a set of parchments.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How’s the, uh,” He pointed to his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, it’s nothing,” she said, idly touching at the bandages wrapped around her forehead. “All sutured up. The healer said I’ll be fully mended in three days, and gave me something for the pain. The worst of it’s already gone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good to know,” he said. ”I’m just glad you’re okay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded. “Oh, before I forget—” she said, the thought coming back to her. “I’ve been thinking: maybe Null could assist us in communicating with the Blin or better understanding their language? I asked and she indicated that she might be able to make sense of other languages if we were to provide her with enough raw data.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think that’s a great idea,” Ari said enthusiastically. “I can’t even imagine how useful the tactical advantage would be. I wish I had thought of that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She paused, raising an eyebrow. “I was actually hoping you might know of someone else who knows the language? But it sounds like you might not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Someone… else?” Ari asked uncertainly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, uh,” Xayla stammered. She took a moment to compose her next words more carefully. It wasn’t too late to avoid putting her foot in her mouth. “Was I mistaken? I thought you told me that Raolin spoke it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Ari said, frowning. “Yeah, I don’t think he actually knew how to <i>speak</i> it. No one does as far as I know. I think he just picked up some words here and there from experience. Maybe he had seen some other duels back in his time? He had a pretty long service record.” He scratched at his head. “Now that I think about it, there’s probably a few others who know about as much as he did… but that doesn’t sound like what you’re after, either.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Xayla said, feeling disappointed. “Not quite.” That was unfortunate. Though perhaps she could find enough information in the archives? It wouldn’t hurt to ask.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shrugged. “We could just capture one?” he offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla couldn’t help but chuckle at that. Leave it to Ari to point out the obvious solutions that no one else saw.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No?” Ari frowned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, sorry,” she said, waving a hand. “I was just… I was overthinking it. Would you mind sending the directive along for me? The Veilwyrd should be able to handle it no problem. We can check back with them when we get back to Castletown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Absolutely,” he said, beaming. “Consider it done!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Ari.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you want to show me something?” Xayla asked, pointing to the parchments he was still carrying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, yeah,” he said. “I know you like reading, so I brought you these.” He untied the band, unrolled the set, and handed over the whole collection. She took the pages, looking them over one at a time. Annotated regional maps. Some tabular data. One of them featured a map of the kingdom with color-coded sections.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What am I looking at?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The latest scouting data and reports from the front,” he said. “Troop movements. Logistics. Damage reports.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah,” Xayla said, unsurprised. How very <i>Ari</i> of him. She wasn’t even going to ask how he arranged to receive these. She shuffled through the pages again, stopping on the colored map. “What are these marks further north?” she asked curiously, pointing to what looked like discrepancies in an otherwise obvious pattern.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari leaned over the gap between beds to get a closer look. “Oh, that one was a raid from the roving bands.” He pointed to the mark west of Castletown. “And the other one,” he pointed to the Floodplains, “that was from before the siege. It was the only battle that took place beforehand. Didn’t you read the reports?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shook her head, feeling a touch of embarrassment. “I confess, I only skimmed them,” she said. “Not exactly my preferred reading.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari frowned, eyeing her suspiciously. “Anyway,” he continued, “the main Blin contingent camped out on the southern shores after marching west from Talus and splitting off from the southern group. We had thought to hold them at the Floodplains and inflict as much damage as we could before having to retreat. But they outmaneuvered us.” He traced out a line to the east. “And you can see that here. A secondary contingent snaked along the mountains, and we weren’t aware of their presence until it was too late. A surprise attack baited us into committing to the defense of a group of settlements there, and we won the battle handily. But then the two larger contingents moved in for a pincer attack, and we were forced to retreat to Castletown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No kidding,” Xayla said, feeling a renewed sense of awe and terror at the unprecedented coordination of their enemy. “Three groups. Three Warlords.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” Ari muttered. He said something else under his breath that Xayla didn’t catch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What was that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I said, ‘I wish they listened!’” he growled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla blinked at him, surprised at the sudden outburst. He turned away, blushing. "I’m sorry, it’s just…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You saw it coming, didn’t you?” she offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded after a moment. “Well, not <i>exactly</i>. But I knew something was off. From the reports at Talus, and my own experience in the field. I noticed the patterns almost two months before the invasion. But they didn’t listen. High Captain Thurdan as good as lied to get me out of his hair, with orders to discharge me once I was back with my uncle.” He grumbled something else unintelligible.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well,” Xayla said with a huff. “If it’s any consolation, he won’t be a High Captain for much longer.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What do you mean?” Ari asked, confused.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean I intend to ask Wymar to replace him.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stammered. “You can’t just—I mean, I guess you can—but… that’s not…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s okay, Ari. I won’t tell anyone but Wymar. You can trust his discretion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you don’t have to do that!” he said hastily. “He’s not a bad captain. He just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Ignored evidence that might have mitigated the severity of the Blight, and sent away the man who would later become the Hero of Castletown and the Queen’s Champion rather than be inconvenienced by his presence?” She raised an eyebrow rather pointedly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh,” Ari rubbed his neck. “I mean… when you put it like that…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Again. Don’t worry about it,” she said, trying to sound assuring. “All I’ll do is give Wymar the details. He’ll make the decision of his own accord—I’m certain of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari sighed. “Okay,” he said, looking back to her. “If you’re sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She smiled and gave him a nod. “It’s for the best. We need to be able to trust the judgment of those in command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another stretch of awkward silence. One would think they’d get used to such in Arlinkar’s presence, but alas…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was there anything else?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, not really,” Ari replied. “Like I said, it’s nothing urgent. But…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He dove into a lengthy and detailed explanation of the current state of the war effort, occasionally leaning over to flip through pages, point out symbols and numbers, or trace lines on the maps for her benefit. Xayla made an honest effort to follow along, but it all made so little sense to her and she lost track almost immediately. He seemed excited though, so she let him continue while she idly pondered other things.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Like Niesis, and the scepter, and her dreams…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And from there we’ll be able to stem ingress from the plains, then turn our attention to rounding up the scattered remnants,” he said, wrapping up. “Nothing’s certain, but it’s I think it’s looking pretty good. That’s the general consensus, anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, I see,” she said, not at all seeing. “Yeah, that’s pretty good.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari eyed her suspiciously again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, alright,” she said, holding up her hands. “You got me. I’m a little distracted. And I’m not that well versed in strategy, afraid to say. Care to summarize?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” he said, sounding surprised and looking vaguely offended. “Why didn’t you just say so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She tried not to roll her eyes. “Well, you seemed to be enjoying the opportunity to share something that interests you. I didn’t want to interrupt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” he said again, staring off into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari? Summary?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right. Uh, well… hmm. Defeat in detail?” he asked. “You’re familiar with that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded. She knew that much. “Divide and conquer, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Honestly that’s most of what you need to know,” he said, not missing a beat. “And keep in mind—they’re raiders, not soldiers. They have no discipline aside from what the Warlords and their like enforce. So the general idea to keep them on the run. Any time they try to group up again, we bait them into breaking off with a charge, then lead them into ambushes, easily defended positions, or just as a distraction. We win with superior numbers and better coordination in the smaller engagements. Or we just pick off the stragglers as they retreat and regroup. That works too. All the while taking care to avoid the main force. And every time we kill one of the leaders, those under them break off into smaller groups, and their ability to coordinate diminishes as well.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused, smiling. “It’s incredible, isn’t it? The old ways, I mean. Tried and tested in ages past, I guess. It’s slow-going, but effective. The Lord General’s projections have us retaking Talus within a month.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla did a double take. “A month?! Ari, that’s amazing! Why didn’t you say that to begin with?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked again over the map. There was much less damage and many fewer causalities than she expected. If it was going to be over in a month…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari cleared his throat, looking uneasy. She bit her lip. “I’m missing something, aren’t I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry, yeah,” he said nervously. “I should have been clearer. They’re much less of a threat to the army when scattered and broken up, but they’re still a threat. Particularly to towns. Villages. Without their leaders to keep them in line, those scattered forces aren’t going to regroup, but they’re also not going to sit still… and there aren’t many defenses south of the Floodplains.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded to herself, eyes falling back to the map. She had to remind herself that the projected death toll was always that—a <i>projection</i>. And she had never known Wymar to be wrong. Most of the death was still happening, or yet to come.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was a sobering thought.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Ari said. “I thought this would help. I didn’t mean to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, it’s okay,” she said, waving a hand and setting aside the parchments. “It’s good news. And we still have time. It’s still a stretch, but if we can ally with the Lynx, then perhaps…” she trailed off. She didn’t want to fall prey to wishful thinking, but she also wanted to hold out hope that the worst wouldn’t come to pass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s our best shot,” Ari said firmly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked him over, seeing plainly his determination. He actually believed in their mission. Far more than she did anyway—that was for certain. How would she justify to him, then, the decision to put off the meeting with Naibi for a few more days?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We <i>are</i> still going, aren’t we?” he asked, eyes narrowing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course,” Xayla said hastily. “Like you said, it’s our best shot.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She winced. Why did he have to be so perceptive all the time? “I want to take a day or three to do some research,” she said. “That’s all. There’s a few leads I’d like to follow up on while we’re here, and there’s also the possibility of finding additional artifacts that Null may be able to reactivate.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And, what? That’s worth their lives?” he asked bluntly. “Those artifacts will still be here in a month, but there are <i>people</i> who <i>won’t</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla crossed her arms, trying not to let either her temper or her nerves get the better of her. He had a point, and she respected his dedication. But he was too narrowly focused, as usual. “Ari, listen to yourself. It doesn’t take a month to get to the mesas and back. And we aren’t delaying by a month—just a few days. Three, at most. No longer than absolutely necessary, I promise. I can’t keep them waiting much longer anyway.” She studied him, trying to get a read. He wasn’t making it easy on her, as usual.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null thinks we have enough power for your mark now,” she tried. “That’s going to take a full day anyway, and we can’t do it while traveling. Best to do that sooner rather than later. We might as well make use of that time, and a day or two on top of that <i>isn’t</i> going to make a difference. And if we find something else like the scepter, that could just as easily give us the edge we need. No?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He grunted, but didn’t make any further argument.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen. I understand. I do,” Xayla said, trying her best to convey a measure of sympathy. “I care every bit as much as—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—We’ll do it your way,” he said flatly, rising to leave and gathering up the reports.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t argue with your reasoning, Xayla. And I’m not going to try. I just hope you aren’t wrong again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She bit back her tongue as she watched him go. She knew he didn’t have any ill intent. Still, his words stung. But as always, she had no one to blame but herself. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodnight, Ari,” she called after him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodnight,” he replied, closing the door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s attention fell back to the scepter. What had that opal been made of, anyway? Was it just an ordinary gemstone? If not, were there more of them, and where did they come from? If so, could Null create artifacts like that with her magic?</span>
<br><br>
<span>So many questions, and so few avenues to pursue answers. But with luck, perhaps other “dormant” items could be reawakened. With luck, she hadn’t destroyed their only clue.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>In a specially prepared room of the monastery, just outside of the temple proper, Xayla strode up to a large round table where the temple’s artifacts were arrayed. With her were Ari and Vestele, as well as Sages Kakaro and Chalia. Null also hovered nearby, and several monks stood along the walls. Xayla turned her attention to the artifacts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A wooden staff. A golden harp. An assortment of seemingly random baubles and trinkets. A shield polished to a mirror’s sheen. Twelve items in total, and none of them bore any signs of being magical in nature.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With luck, some of them could be reawakened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But where to begin? Xayla paced back and forth, and came to stop in front of the harp. “What can you tell me about this one?” she asked of no one in particular.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sage Kakaro was first to speak; his voice was soft but his words clearly spoken. Xayla had met him before while studying under Sage Amaran, though she hadn’t spoken with him since. He was older than Vestele, though younger than Amaran by at least twenty years.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“’Tis a great and historied item, Your Grace,” he said. “An ancient relic, preserved from the time of the Old Kingdom. Supposedly, it was crafted by Queen Navala as a gift to her mother, Nialay, after she sought the blessing of the Holy Mother.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. That was promising. “And what does it do?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pardon?” Kakaro replied.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned, looking to the man quizzically. “Navala’s Harp? What does it do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It… plays pleasing melodies?” Kakaro ventured.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stared at him incredulously. Vestele cleared her throat and spoke up before Xayla could respond. “I believe Her Grace wishes to know of any magical abilities or properties the harp possesses?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Most likely? None,” the other woman said: Sage Chalia. She was young for a sage, though still many years older than Xayla herself. “There is no indication of it being anything other than an ordinary—” an exaggerated cough sounded to her right, “—of it being anything other than a great and historied ancient relic preserved from the time of the Old Kingdom,” she said, correcting herself. “Apologies, Your Grace, but I didn’t want to leave anything out. Just in case.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Sage,” Xayla said, bowing her head with a smile. “That is most prudent. We certainly wouldn’t want to miss anything.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned to Null. “When you’re ready—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All eyes turned to Ari. He stood stiffly, holding up a finger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it?” Xayla asked, feeling concerned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry. I was just thinking,” he said. “Shouldn’t we move it away from the others first, just to be safe?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla resisted the urge to smack herself. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm, good idea,” Kakaro said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, a wise precaution,” Vestele affirmed. “Chalia, if you please?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sage Chalia nodded to the priestess and Xayla stepped aside, making way. Chalia delicately lifted the harp with the silk cloth it rested upon, and carried it to a smaller table several feet away. Xayla and the others followed behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any other concerns?” Xayla asked once they were settled. She scanned the room, meeting the eyes of each of the others in turn. None spoke.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. Null?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Understood,” Null said, floating to rest above the harp. She summoned up her magic, and chromatic vapors—teal and purple swirling with subtle violet undertones—rose around her. They waited with palpable anticipation… but nothing happened. The harp rested still; dormant, and undisturbed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anything?” Kakaro asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative,” Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alas!” he bemoaned dramatically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry. There’s still eleven more to go,” Xayla said. Surely some of them would respond to Null’s magic. Surely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed,” Vestele agreed. Xayla watched as she motioned to a pair of robed monks standing by the wall at the side of the room. They approached the harp carrying a medium-sized glass box, placed the item inside, and gingerly carted it away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any suggestions for which to try next?” Xayla asked as they made their way back over to the larger table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, we’re going to test them all, aren’t we?” Ari said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then does it matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sighed. “No, I suppose it doesn’t.” She looked him over. “So how about you pick this time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What, me?” Ari asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh. Okay, sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stood back with the others as Ari circled the table. She glanced to Vestele, though the priestess refused to meet her eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stopped in front of the wooden staff. “How about this one?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A fine choice,” Kakaro said eagerly. “<i>That</i>, is the Arbiter’s Staff! It once belonged to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Kakaro?” Vestele interrupted. “Perhaps we should save the history lessons for <i>after</i> we’ve sorted out the magical ones? Otherwise we’ll be here all day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, really? Are you sure?” he asked, sounding thoroughly disappointed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There will be plenty of time for that later,” Xayla cut in, attempting to appease him. “I for one would <i>love</i> to hear everything you have to say about these priceless treasures. Perhaps later this evening, over tea?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kakaro beamed. “Ah, I always knew you to be a fellow connoisseur of history! I would be most delighted, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Splendid!” Xayla said with a smile. “Let’s move on then, shall we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari reached for the staff.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hands off!” Chalia yelled, scolding.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari jumped, snatching his hands back and stepping away. “Right, sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia glared daggers as she brushed passed him. With gloved hands she took up the staff, treating it with all the reverence and care it was no doubt due. They followed her over to the small table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla took a deep breath. “Alright. Null?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once again, Null’s magics swirled about. Once again, nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww,” Ari said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s alright, Ari," Xayla said teasingly. “I’m sure we’ll find an ancient magical weapon of immense power for you someday.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really? You think so?” he said. “Because that would be pretty awesome."</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who knows?” Xayla said with a short laugh. “As <i>Nenore’s chosen hero</i>, you’re practically destined to wield the Blade of Reckoning!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh come on,” he said, waving a hand. “Now I know you’re just messing with me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you please,” Vestele said listlessly, “we haven’t all day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Apologies, Your Holiness,” Ari said, bowing reverently. “I meant no disrespect.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ugh. She was sure in a foul mood. Xayla probably should have taken time to talk with her personally beforehand. “As you say, High Priestess,” she replied. “Sage Chalia, if you don’t mind? We can skip the pageantry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly,” Chalia said, taking up a circular stone disk. It fit easily in her palm. Xayla studied the item; on closer inspection, she noticed there was a strange, radially symmetric pattern etched onto its surface, and it had a small hole on one side. Odd. Just the right size to fit a chain or rope through?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once it had been placed, she gave Null the signal. And once again, wisps of magic swirled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—And this time, the tablet <i>buzzed</i> faintly, vibrating on the surface of the small table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By the Mother!” Kakaro exclaimed. “It worked!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now isn’t that something,” Chalia said, edging closer. She took the disk in hand, holding it up to the light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any changes?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not that I can see.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The object is now resonating sinusoidally at an approximate frequency of one hundred oscillations per second.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No kidding,” Xayla said dryly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia looked between them, then shook her head. “What now?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m… not sure,” Xayla said uncertainly. “Kakaro? What’s the history on this one?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe it was an item belonging to one of the original Seekers,” he said. “No other details on record, unfortunately. Never are with those things.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null, do you have any ideas as to its purpose or function?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vestele?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let me see it,” Vestele said, fishing for her spectacles.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia stepped over, but stopped abruptly midway. “Huh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it?” Xayla and Vestele asked in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s vibrating a little stronger now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure?" Vestele asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia nodded. “Yes, Priestess. I’m certain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla cocked her head. “Chalia? Try stepping back towards Null.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She did so. “Oh, hmm. It’s weaker now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now towards Ari.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Maybe stronger? I don’t know if it changed. It’s hard to say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps… hmm. “Alright. Very carefully,” she said, gesturing for emphasis, “and I mean <i>one step at a time</i>, head towards the table with the artifacts. Stop if anything strange happens.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia took a step. “A little stronger?” Another. “Yeah, stronger again.” Three more, slowly. “I think you’re right. It’s stronger with every step.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, wow. Is it a magical artifact finder?” Ari asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We can’t say anything for certain,” Xayla said. “Though we may be able to use it for that purpose. Null, you’re sure you aren’t detecting <i>any</i> types of magic from the other items?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative: I am sure. The items contain no traces of magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And you can detect some from the disk now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Only what I used to power it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Would you be able to tell us if it posed a risk? Like the scepter did with Niesis?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say for certain, though it is unlikely,” she said. “Few of the factors from the event with Niesis are present, and the other objects are as of yet inert.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It stopped vibrating,” Chalia said.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>By the Mother.</i> Of course it would run out of power. “Null, how much magic did you use just then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Approximately twenty units’ worth.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er… is that a lot?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative. I may recharge the item, if you wish.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please do. Chalia, you’re safe to hold it while she works. Just hold still.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Mistress.” / “As you say, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null floated over to the woman. Her chromatic aura—shimmering teal and purple—rose again, flowing into the disk. Once more, it <i>buzzed</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Chalia, can you walk around the table now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Carefully please,” Vestele said, somewhat anxiously. “Stay at least a few steps back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman nodded and went, the rest following close behind. Xayla watched with bated breath as she circled around the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s strongest here,” Chalia said, coming to a stop in front of what looked like a featureless silver egg. “It gets weaker any time I step away. It’s just this one, I think.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vestele, I’m going to take the egg now. Any objections?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just be careful. And give her time to step away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla approached and Chalia stepped aside. Slowly, gently, she took the egg. It was cold to the touch, and looked to be the same color as the metal rod of the scepter. She looked to Chalia, then took two steps back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A little weaker.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A few more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, much weaker now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, I’m going to step all the way back over here now. Go around again? Let’s see if it picks up anything else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia circled the table once more. “Nothing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Interesting.</i> “Possibly it isn’t vibrating in response to magic, but something to do with the egg in particular?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It stopped again,” Chalia informed them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Chalia,” Vestele said, calling over her shoulder. “Let’s leave it back on the table for now.” She turned back to Xayla. “Curious—I don’t recall anything about that one. Kakaro?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sadly, no,” he said with a melodramatic groan. “Only curators’ notes. It’s likely the item has been at this temple since before we started the record.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, now <i>that</i> sounded promising. “Null, do you detect anything anomalous about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay then.” Xayla pressed her lips together. “Go ahead,” she said, nodding to the floating entity and holding out the egg.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wisps and tendrils flowed from Null into the object. It instantly lit up with runes glowing a pale white on its surface.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vestele!” Xayla exclaimed, rushing over. “There’s writing! Can you read it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother of Creation!” Kakaro said, edging closer to get a look.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm, let’s see…” Vestele said, taking the egg and turning it slowly in her hands. “Interesting. It looks to be Old Script?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you read it?” Xayla repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele glared at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry. Take your time,” Xayla said. She backed away, trying not to crowd the priestess. She found it difficult to contain her excitement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pieces of it, yes…" Vestele said after a short pause. “But there are a few symbols I don’t recognize. It says: <i>‘My child: I am … you have … to walk this path. But your … has only begun. Through … your … will be tested, through … your strength will be …, and through … you will gain … what lies ahead. Seek out … of wind and earth. Then of fire, water, and life. Only then will you be … of my favor.’</i> Worthy? Yes, ‘worthy of my favor.’ And then several more lines, but they aren’t Old Script. They aren’t like anything I know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have important information to share. Would you like to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Yes!</i>” Xayla half-yelled, causing Vestele to withdraw and Kakaro to jump back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry,” she muttered. “What is it, Null?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The additional lines were intended for me,” Null said. “They are instructions from Avalia pertaining to the item’s use.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s mind blanked. <i>Intended for</i>… “Null, you’re going to have to be more specific than that. What do you mean it was <i>intended</i> for you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is written in a language that only I understand,” she said, floating up to rest horizontally in the air, front facing the ground and eyes on Xayla. “Although I am unable to translate the instructions into your language, I am now able to make use of the item if desired. I must caution you against its use, however; the procedure poses a substantial danger to the health and wellbeing of the participant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, Null? You’re doing that thing again where you skip over the important parts,” Ari said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Apologies. What would you like clarified?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How about starting with what it does?” Xayla said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That is also impossible to accurately translate.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you try?” Ari asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I will attempt to do so,” she said, returning to her neutral pose. “Using the substance contained inside, I will be able to permanently alter the essence of a single individual. Though the nature of the transformation is not describable in your language, I can say that it was an initiation rite of the Lightsworn. It was intended to be performed before undergoing their trials.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla blinked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia let out a low whistle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Astounding,</i>” Kakaro said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele held the silvery egg out in front of her with a newfound appreciation. “Just to think, all this time…"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null, when you say it’s dangerous, what exactly do you mean?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is a greater than twenty-percent probability of suffering permanent spiritual damage, death, or worse.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Worse?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll do it,” Ari said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The four of them turned to face him in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? I suffered through bloodrage and lived,” he said with a shrug. “There’s no way a Lightsworn ritual can be that bad.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He couldn’t be serious! …Or rather, he was <i>absolutely serious</i>, and therein laid the problem. Xayla supposed it only made sense, considering that a fragment of Spirit had found its way to him. “Uhh—you do remember the part where I spent a good chunk of the magic reserves of a <i>literal goddess</i> healing you until I blacked out, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, but Avalia was the one who sent you after me in the first place, right? And she had faith in me then. I have to do the same now. The way I see it, if I’m not fit to be a Lightsworn, I’m not fit to be her Champion either.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Unbelievable</i>,” Xayla muttered. She looked to Vestele, who only shrugged with a minute shake of her head, as if to say <i>don’t ask me</i>. “Ari, listen—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Didn’t you say something to me earlier about finding the ‘edge we needed?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay. She stepped right into that one. “I’m not going to be able to talk you out of this, am I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shook his head. “Nope.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The High Priestess passed the silvery egg off to Ari and backed away without fuss. It felt cold to his touch, and was a lot lighter than it looked. Sage Kakaro and Sage Chalia followed her example, giving him a wide berth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Odd. He expected more of an argument. Did they know his secret, or did they just blithely accept that he was insane?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure you want to go through with this?” Xayla asked. “Right now? As in, <i>right this very second?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s as good a time as any, isn’t it?” Ari said. “Better here than on the road.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re a braver lad than I,” Sage Kakaro said in a hushed tone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t you think we should at least consider the possibility that—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I’ll be fine,” Ari interrupted. “It’s okay. I’ve got this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla studied him again with that piercing gaze of hers, her head cocked to the side and with arms crossed. He had to figure out how she did that. He always felt like she could see right through him. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure? What if it doesn’t work?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was true—he was banking a lot on this, but even if the fragment didn’t save him, he had a feeling he would be okay. Something about the idea of a Lightsworn ritual that blindly killed a fifth of its inductees didn’t sit right with him. How could Avalia allow such a thing? It wasn’t anything like what he expected of the Holy Mother.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No; he was pretty sure this was a test. He couldn’t be certain, but it made a lot more sense when you looked at it from that perspective. No doubt the trials they faced were harrowing. It would only make sense to filter out the halfhearted and self-serving at the first opportunity, wouldn’t it? And if it did pose an actual danger? Well, then he just had to take the risk. The Lightsworn were a force of myth and legend! Avalia’s own order of chosen knights, sworn to defend the Realm and rise to her aid when called…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wondered if the allure of it was clouding his judgment. He didn’t believe himself to be a vain man—but then, who did? Ari imagined five men under his command considering the same decision. He certainly wouldn’t make the choice for them. But at the same time, if they decided to put their lives at risk, knowing one among them would die? He wouldn’t stop them either. Four Lightsworn versus five regular soldiers, no matter how talented? It wasn’t even a consideration. If it meant risking his life for the good of the kingdom, he had to do it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari?” Xayla said, looking concerned. “Having second thoughts?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” he said with conviction. “I’m sure. Null, let’s do this.” He raised the egg up high, clasping it with both hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rubbed her face with her palms. She looked to object again, but then scurried off to stand with the others.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I must reiterate my concerns as to your safety,” Null said. “Are you certain you wish to proceed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t sure what he was expecting. A fancy ritual? More swirling magics, followed by instructions from Null on how to use whatever the egg contained?</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was nothing of the sort.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Without warning, the egg <i>burst</i>. Fragments of jagged, razor-sharp metal flew from his hands and whirled about, embedding themselves into his flesh one at a time. The pain was overwhelming. Ari <i>screamed</i>, falling to his knees. At the same time, he choked as a thick vaporous substance forced its way into his mouth. The taste was fouler than anything he could imagine, though it barely registered next to the searing agony that flared up from every fiber of his being. He retched, then convulsed, and fought with all his strength to remain conscious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And then it was over. He looked up to see Xayla standing over him, motes of green swirling in her hands. He held up a hand and shook his head. She backed away. Voices… there were voices. He couldn’t make out what they were saying, but he knew they had to be worried about him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m alright,” he managed between breaths. “It’s okay. That wasn’t… so bad.” He smiled and, with some effort, rose to his feet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What were they staring at?</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Dizzy</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari wobbled, trying to steady himself. His vision faded, and he blacked out.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>A grand palace nestled in the forests at the edge of a river; at its center, a courtyard with a chasm that stretched deep into the abyss. An obsidian spire hidden away in the mountains; the path to it obscured by shifting sands and blistering winds. A vast basin filled with water and teeming with life; an island rested at its center, perpetually clouded by fog and shadow. A great temple built from living wood; trees and brush shaped to grow into a twisting labyrinth of bewildering complexity. A lone mountain in the middle of the ocean; surrounded by a ring of islands, with fire and brimstone erupting from its peak. </i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ari stirred awake in the middle of the night in a bed at the infirmary. Here again? They should probably be more careful with these ancient artifacts. But strangely enough, he felt just fine after the ordeal. Great, even. Was he a Lightsworn now? He didn’t feel any different…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Looking around, he noticed two other bodies resting nearby, though Ari wasn’t sure who they were. Quietly, he slipped out of bed trying not to wake them, and found his gear tucked away in the corner of the room. He wasn’t sure what time it was, but a walk would be nice to gather his thoughts and reflect on all that had happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari?” Xayla whispered. “Are you alright?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, hey,” he said, turning to see her sitting on the edge of her bed in a silken nightdress. He tried not to dwell on any improper thoughts. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just going out for a walk. Don’t mind me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whazzit?” came another voice. The other body rustled awake, and Ari recognized her as one of Xayla’s Veilwyrd guard. Koja, wasn’t it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s nothing,” Xayla said. “Ari’s awake. Nothing to worry about—you can go back to sleep.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm, kay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure you’re alright?” she asked. “You’ve been out for three days. We should probably get the nurse to check on you at least.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Three days?</i> It definitely didn’t feel that long. “No, I’m alright,” he said firmly. “Really. But I’ll go see a healer if it makes you feel better. You should get back to sleep. We can talk in the morning.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sat at the edge of her bed in silence. Ari wasn’t sure what she was thinking, and couldn’t make out any features of her face in the darkness. “Alright, if you say so,” she said at last, yawning before tucking herself back into bed. “Goodnight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“See you later,” he said. He passed through the door, through the halls, and made his way out into the night.</span>
<br><br>
