<span>Link couldn’t sleep. Nightmares, as usual. And so, he found himself sitting atop a guard tower at the southeastern edge of the castle grounds, preparing a meal by the firepit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was raining, and that helped. Link found comfort in the rain. It wasn’t a particularly heavy rain, but rather the steady drizzle characteristic of the last few weeks of Storms. The soft patter all about, the low rumblings in the distance, and the gentle tapping on the roof above put his mind at ease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It almost drowned out the sounds of boisterous soldiers playing cards a floor below.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was not his place to criticize, but he couldn’t help but feel that most of the city guard didn’t take their duty very seriously. He was off-duty himself (and technically not part of the guard besides), but he didn’t have anything else to do in town. Might as well do something marginally useful with his time. If nothing else, he took solace in the routine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At this hour, amid the first stirrings of dawn, not much was visible save for other guard towers and a few dozen islands of light along the walkways and walls. The lampposts glowed rather than flickered; the steady light of red magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unbidden, his mind flashed to images of bloodthirsty Blin charging on armored boars across an open field at dusk, eyes and steel glowing with that same red tinge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook himself from the images, trying to focus on his meal instead. The food here in Castletown was much better than the rations back in Talus. Roasted tubers and boiled hrok eggs with oxgoat cheese and sourmilk. He’d take this over hardtack and jerky any day.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He watched along the walls as he enjoyed his meal in solitude. Mentally, he noted pathways to and from the castle, the patrols and their timings, and their positioning relative to other manned guard towers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just as he was finishing up he heard a call from below—“High Captain in command! At arms!”—followed by clamoring of feet and metal.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Uncle Raolin?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hurried to clean up, tossing his leavings into the fire. He hadn’t thought his uncle would be out so early, or he wouldn’t have come here. A minute or so passed as he waited anxiously, trying to make out the indistinct sounds of conversation between his uncle and the sergeant on duty.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At last the hatch opened and High Captain Raolin made his way up. He was clad in full officer’s regalia; a tight fitting blue coat hemmed in gold and bearing the winged-shield crest of the City Guard. A cane clacked against the stone with every other step, with Raolin slightly favoring his left leg. Link couldn’t help but note he had gained weight in the three years since they had last met.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stood and saluted, right hand crossed over his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At ease, son.” Raolin said with a smirk. “You’re not on duty here, and you are not under my command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sir.” Linked dropped his salute and stood at ease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin laughed and shook his head. He took two steps forward and held his arms outstretched. He met Link’s eyes and cocked his head to one side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link relented and embraced his uncle. Raolin gave him a good firm squeeze, then with a hearty guffaw, stepped back and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Goddesses, look at you,” he beamed. “All grown up! You get any taller and I’ll be the one looking up to you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link couldn’t help but smile at his uncle’s simple but earnest affection. “I missed you, Uncle. How’s city life treating you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah!” Raolin said, genuine mirth in his eyes. “Getting that scratch was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I get to sit in on Council meetings, have a dozen Lieutenants clambering to lick my boots…” He trailed off, following Link’s gaze. “Can’t say I much enjoy the paperwork, though.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link couldn’t find words to respond, so he just stood quietly, nodding. He never really imagined Raolin as the city type. He was glad to hear his uncle was doing well, though.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin frowned. “What are you doing out here, anyway? I know you got in late—you should be sleeping. Something bothering you?” He led the way to the benches nearby and took a seat, taking off his gloves and warming his hands by the fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Link said, unthinking. He winced. “Yes,” he amended quickly. “Er, I don’t know,” he said, attempting to convey his frustration with hand gestures as he took a seat on the bench. “It’s… complicated.” He wasn’t feeling keen on rehashing his thoughts yet again. Lately everyone seemed overly concerned for him; he didn’t want to worry his uncle too.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve seen it all, son,” Raolin said earnestly. “Try me. Why don’t you start with your last skirmish?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well, he knew that was coming. “It was a bad one,” Link began with a sigh. “We tracked a small band that managed to evade patrols through the passes and into the basin. They were headed straight for Hateno, but turned south just before we caught up.” He paused, discomfort rising within. Raolin didn’t say anything, instead motioning for Link to continue. He did.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I lost five of my men. None of them died in the fighting. We actually routed them despite it all—even had healers on hand. But… their wounds…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bloodrage,” his uncle spat. “Damn those curs to the Void.” Raolin growled under his breath as he rubbed at his leg. “It’s not a pretty way to go, not by a damn sight. I’m sorry you had to see that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not that,” Link said, shaking his head. He wondered how much he should volunteer. “That was… horrible… but I’ve seen it before. And we all know what our duty means.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin nodded solemnly. He motioned as if to say “go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world spun, and Link kept speaking despite himself. He felt disconnected, as if watching himself from a distance. “It didn’t have to happen like that. I could’ve saved them,” he said, voice barely above a whisper. “Something was off. It was the smells, I think. It didn’t smell like they had actually camped that night. I didn’t know what it was at the time, but I didn’t like it. My second insisted the intel was good, that we were in a good position. Said I was being paranoid. I didn’t want to argue, so I gave the order. But I was right. Twice their number were waiting for us in the mountains. It was an ambush.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin crossed his arms, mouth drawing to a line. “I read the report, son. Ambush or no, you made the right call, and likely saved a lot of lives.” He shook his head. “Losing men who died at your orders? It’s rough. But it happens to the best of us. You can’t blame yourself, and I won’t watch you beat yourself up over it. Trust me son, it could’ve been a lot worse.” A flash of concern, worry, and an uneasy smile. “But it wasn’t, and <i>you</i> are to thank for that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. I mean, I know,” Link said, coming back to himself. Hearing praise always made him uncomfortable, even when it came from his uncle. But it wasn’t about the skirmish. That ate at him, but there was more to it. His uncle wasn’t seeing it. Why didn’t anyone else see it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s just… that wasn’t the first time. It was just the worst,” Link said. “It’s worrying—they’re too organized. There’s been more and more reports like that lately. You’ve seen them too, haven’t you?” He hesitated. He might as well just say it. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say they’re feeling out our defenses, gathering information. I fear the worst.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You think there’s a Warlord,” Raolin said flatly, his expression unreadable. “Son, if they had a Warlord leading them, they wouldn’t bother with anything but a straight assault with overwhelming force. You know that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gazed back over the grounds. Lieutenant Averil had said roughly the same, that it was nothing new and nothing unexpected. She had actually ordered him to spend a fortnight reading history before bothering her again, much to Link’s embarrassment. Still, it didn’t add up, even if he didn’t have a better explanation. The Blin <i>were</i> too organized. Link understood their perspective; a couple dozen more deaths than usual over the course of a year was hardly cause for alarm. But they weren’t there like he was!</span>
<br><br>
<span>He could feel his uncle watching him intently. He had let the silence go on too long again. A heavy tension hung in the air. Uncle Raolin knew him better than anyone, and Link knew he was only trying to give him space. Still, the weight of Raolin’s attention pressed down on him and smothered his thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned back to the guard patrols. He pointed off to the side, desperate to change the subject. “See that? There’s a timing gap.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A what?” Raolin looked to where Link was pointing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A gap,” Link said. “Every five or six minutes, there’s about a twelve second gap in the guard patrols… <i>there,</i> that isn’t covered by any manned towers. At least at this hour.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin grunted, seeming unconcerned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean I could probably slip through if I wanted,” Link offered. “Would be nothing for a trained assassin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Arlinkar…” Raolin said, gaping at him in disbelief. “We’re in <i>Castletown</i>!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link winced at the use of his full name. He made to respond, but turned away, flustered. There wasn’t anything he could say to salvage it now. <i>Stupid…</i> He knew not to let thoughts like that slip. Talking like that tended to make people get bad ideas about his mental state, and he was already under enough scruitiny. It was difficult, though. He couldn’t help but let his guard down around his uncle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin stammered, running his hand through his hair. “Link, listen to yourself! Who would do such a thing? We haven’t been at war with the Gerudo for over a thousand years. Why in the name of the Holy Mother Above would we be worried about <i>assassins</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The King—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Sheikah are looking into the King,” Raolin said, cutting him off. “And if they suspected anything, I would be the first to know.” A pause. “As it happens, they say it to be a natural illness.” Pause. “Besides, why would someone send assassins after the fact? That would be absurd.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something in his uncle’s words bothered him. A natural illness—that was what Link had heard elsewhere. But he had done some reading, and asked around—the oldest and most experienced healers he knew. He hadn’t found any records of illnesses like that, and they hadn’t heard of any either. Come to think of it, would his uncle actually tell him if the Sheikah found something? Would the <i>Sheikah</i> even tell anyone?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sat still. He didn’t like that tone. He didn’t like where this was going.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, look at me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did so. Raolin put a hand on his shoulder. His eyes were red. It pained Link to see him like that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Son, you are far too young to carry the weight of the world with you. I cannot abide this. They told me, but I didn’t think it was this bad.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link started, eyes narrowing. “I’m fine, Uncle. I just…” He stood, stepping away to cover his frustration. “I need some time to clear my head. That’s all. I know I’ve been through a lot, but I can handle it. I’ll be fine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin muttered something under his breath that Link didn’t catch. “I won’t mince words,” he said. “You deserve that much. Your assignment as guard detail to the envoy was a pretense. They didn’t think you’d take kindly to being discharged, and didn’t want to chance what you’d do on hearing the news, so they sent you back to me instead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So that’s it, then?” Link snapped, his suspicions confirmed. His heart pounded in his ears. He was not one to question orders, but everything about the envoy mission was wrong. Link thought they were simply sending him away again to “unwind,” but this?! How could they?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin stood and hobbled over to stand shoulder-to-shoulder, leaning heavily on his cane. Link glanced over to him. In that moment, he saw all the years of age written plainly on his Uncle’s face. Try as he might, he found it hard to hold on to his anger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin took a slow, measured breath. “Son, I know how important this to you. Your heart is in the right place. But you can’t burn yourself up like this. You’ve been on duty for <i>seven years</i> without reprieve! You’re jumping at shadows. No one serves in the field that long, and for good reason. You know that. Most only go a year at a time, and spend twice or more back home between rotations. What you’re doing is <i>insane.</i> Talus has stood for hundreds of years before you, and will continue to stand after you. There are many, many more to shoulder this burden.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link had nothing to say to that. His uncle wasn’t <i>wrong</i>, and Link knew he was genuinely worried. Still, it ate at him. He had to be able to do more. He had to be able to… to protect those that could not protect themselves. Like the Lightsworn of old! That was his <i>calling</i>! So what if it meant sacrifice? That was the whole point, wasn’t it? He shouldered the burden so others didn’t have to. How could they ask him to give up on what Hylia herself had ordained?</span>
<br><br>
<span>His uncle stirred next to him, scratching at his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah! Before I forget, I wanted to give you something,” Raolin said, fishing a necklace out from under his coat. He unclasped it and held it in his palm. He looked distant, as if reminiscing on an old memory. “It’s an old family heirloom,” he said. He turned the necklace over in his palm before passing it to Link. “Your grandfather gave it to me, and his father to him. It should be yours now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hesitantly, Link took the necklace and examined it. It was a simple thing: a jagged golden shard on a thin chain. There was something… something he couldn’t place exactly, but something about holding this necklace felt <i>right</i>. “I… thank you, Uncle,” he said, gazing at the shard, completely transfixed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They say it brings fortune and good luck to whoever wears it,” Raolin said, tapping his leg with his cane. “I’m not sure what I think about that, but I’m still standing despite everything, so maybe there’s a grain of truth to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded, clasping the chain behind his neck. He suddenly found that he had lost track of his thoughts. What had he been thinking about just now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey,” Raolin said with a pat to the back. “Cheer up—there’s good news. I pulled some strings, and got you a position in the Royal Guard.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked to his uncle, askance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin held up a hand. “Now before you say no, keep in mind this is a <i>prestigious position</i>. It will open doors for you. They’re highly selective—young men your age would kill for the chance.” Somehow, he managed to look smug. “But given your service history, it was an easy enough sell.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Royal Guard,” Link said testily. “You want me to be a glorified doormat?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin gave a dramatic sigh, slouching. Link looked away. He didn’t like disappointing his uncle, but he could also tell when he was being manipulated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, come now. It’s not as bad as that,” Raolin said. “You’ll have plenty of opportunities to get out. Princess Zelda is rather fond of going on excursions around the countryside—and increasingly often as of late.” He paused, eyes lighting up. “You know, she’s always going on about ‘research’ and ‘experiments’ and how her ideas will revolutionize the world and fix everything. Come to think of it, I think you two would get along <i>splendidly</i>. And who knows?” He jabbed Link’s side playfully, winking and wagging his eyebrows.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncle…” Link started in annoyance, feeling his face flush. He tried to hide it, but not before Raolin saw. Chuckling, Raolin threw his arm around Link’s shoulder and ruffled his hair. Link ducked out of the grapple, breaking free and rolling his eyes as he smoothed his hair. He tried not to smile. This wasn’t the time to get caught up in silly games.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Promise me you’ll at least think about it, yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded before he could catch himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Great!” Raolin bellowed, cracking his cane against the floor. “I’ll let Vian know right away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, I didn’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll schedule a meeting for you in a few hours,” Raolin called over his shoulder. To Link’s horror, he had already turned to leave and was heading back down the steps. “Oh, and one more thing. You’re to take the day off. That means actually try and relax. No training, no patrolling, and for the love of the Mother: no brooding. And come by for dinner tonight! Those are orders.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncle!” Link stammered, calling after him. “I… I thought I wasn’t under your command!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>His uncle laughed, turning back just as he disappeared below the hatch. “You are now, son!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stood bewildered as the hatch swung shut with a clack. Eventually his thoughts caught up to him. His shoulders slumped in defeat and he took a long, measured breath. He had a lot to think about, and honestly had no idea what to do from here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It couldn’t be too bad, he told himself. Uncle Raolin had always looked out for him.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda rushed to sit at her study, belatedly reviewing her notes in preparation for the meeting with Sage Amaurath in—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Three knocks sounded at the door to the hallway below, echoing softly against the walls. Zelda motioned frantically to her handmaiden with raised eyebrows for emphasis. To her relief, Anli was already halfway down the stairs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That girl was worth her weight in rupees.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rose from her study, flipping through her notes and scanning them with rapidity in preparation for the meeting with Sage Amaurath in a-few-seconds-ago. She ducked behind a bookcase to buy herself an extra few-seconds-ago.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She really needed to plan better. Her schedule these days…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A slow creak. Echoing voices. Footsteps. The voices drew near and became more distinct. </span>
<br><br>
<span><i>“… hospitality … not expecting … but asked me to accompany him to meet with the Princess today.”</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait, was that <i>Counselor Taetus?</i> What in damnation was he doing here?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Splendid! I am sure Her Grace will be excited as ever to see you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda silently prayed to Hylia that her snort of laughter didn’t give away her position.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Would either of you like some tea?” Anli asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, thank you.” / “None for me today.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda closed her notebook and set it on an empty shelf, hurrying to meet with her guests. It was considered rude, even insulting to keep guests waiting for any length of time, especially when the host had arranged the meeting. As it was, she was already straining the limits of propriety.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. I shall go and fetch Her Grace. Please, make yourself comfortable.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah! No need, Anli.” Zelda curtsied and made her way down the stairs. “Sage Amaurath, I am most delighted to meet with you today.” What <i>was</i> Taetus doing here? “…and Counselor Taetus! I was not expecting your company.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Anli curtsied and dismissed herself. Amaurath bowed his head towards Zelda, and Taetus bowed much lower.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The pleasure is mine, Your Grace,” Amaurath intoned, the way that only the most venerable, highly-regarded men could. “I, ah—I asked the Counselor here today to… ah…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Holiness, if you please, allow me.” Taetus offered. Amaurath nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, forgive my intrusion,” Taetus began, the way that only the most pompous, serpent-tongued vermin could. “The Sage asked me here today to see that the expense reports presented to the Council are accurate, and that you are properly informed of the impediments to your projects.” He raised an eyebrow. “Those being mostly fiscal in nature.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda forced herself outwardly to maintain composure, clasping her hands cordially and offering naught but an unfalteringly radiant smile. Inwardly, she contemplated the extent of the consequences should she decide to obliterate this wretched fool here and now. It would be such an easy thing. A single Burst of blue magic projected into a sheet of razor-sharp ice would sever his greedy, duplicitous, conniving—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is—ah—not as bad as the Counselor implies, Your Grace,” Amaurath said. “I have plenty of good news to share. It’s just that… well.” He shifted uncomfortably. “Perhaps we should move to discussions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, let’s,” Zelda replied, perhaps too quickly. She tore her eyes away and motioned to the small table that had been prepared for their meeting. She led the way, and they followed. “Are you sure you wouldn’t be interested in some tea?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She motioned to Anli as they walked. Turning away to ensure her eyes were hidden from view, she projected a single word telepathically to her handmaiden. <i>Nightshade.</i> Zelda had every expectation that this would be a stressful meeting. Best to ensure her nerves remained calm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace is most considerate, but I am quite alright,” Taetus said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaurath looked to decline, then reconsidered. “Ahh… yes actually. Thank you. Tea sounds lovely.” He raised his voice in courtesy to the serving girl. “Ginger and honey?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The trio took their seats. Zelda, recalling her notes, decided to bring up the topic that interested her most. This way at least, even if the results were poor, the worst of it would be over quickly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So,” she chirped. “To business, then? Shall we start with the Blindscrier project?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Blindscriers.</i> She was quite fond of the name—her own of course. The idea itself was simple, though the execution and implications of its use were more involved. Rather than requiring trained Blue mages to operate communication lines between towns with use of scrying and telepathy, Blindscriers required only a focused light source atop a tower. Patterns of open and closed blinds in front of the light, together with a clever encoding scheme, could be used to relay messages near instantaneously across distances comparable to scrying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(The idea for the encoding scheme itself was the result of painstaking historical research, meticulous cross-checking of references, and a fair amount of inference from incomplete records. Even then she only knew what she had found due to her talent in the abstract philosophies.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Brilliant. Absolutely, magnificently, <i>brilliant</i>. With Blindscriers (and <i>a bit</i> of setup cost) they could expand the communication networks to every single village and hamlet throughout the kingdom, rather than just between the largest towns and military outposts as was currently done. The increased efficiency in trade would more than pay for the costs in time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah yes, excellent, most excellent,” Amaurath began, visibly composing his thoughts. In old age, his mind was as sharp as ever, though it took more care to wield.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Blindscriers, yes. The design proved to be simple enough. As I thought, there were quite a few issues with transcription mistakes being propagated and compounded at first, but after applying your suggestions on redundancy and cross-checking, the errors were wholly eliminated, at the expense of roughly doubled transmission time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still assuredly impressive, most impressive,” he added after a pause. “I am also pleased to inform you that every operator in the initial groups managed passable scores on transmission and transcription with two weeks’ training. It is not as fast or as accurate as scrying—ah… but it gets the job done.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda allowed herself a moment of self-congratulation, even as she could feel the “but” looming ominously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But… ah… well…“ he began, drumming his nerves at the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus cut in, clearing his throat. “Your Grace, allow me to summarize. I understand your plan is for the Crown to finance clearing, construction, supply, training, upkeep,“ he ticked off fingers individually, then spread his hand wide, ”…and other costs upfront, to be repaid in time with funds appropriated from tariffs after your predicted increases in mercantilism and intervillage commerce.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pause for dramatic effect. Yes, that was the plan. Zelda had to fight not to tap her foot or roll her eyes. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Allow me to be blunt. The reality of the situation is that, in light of recent efforts, we cannot afford such a monolithic expenditure on the basis of speculation.” He gestured dramatically for emphasis, as he was wont to do. “Keeping the communication towers supplied and safe from fiends is the bulk of the cost. I’m afraid we simply cannot afford to do this at scale.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cocked her head. <i>That</i> was his objection? “Counselor Taetus. Was it not the plan to cut back operations to what we can presently afford, prioritizing areas by population and expected returns, and scaling the network as funds allowed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus balked, mild annoyance flitting over his face. “Your Grace, with respect. I do not believe you understand the true extent of this endeavor.” With a nervous laugh, he reached into a pocket and unrolled a map. “As you suggest, we attempted to construct <i>a single line</i> between Hateno and the largest village cluster in the floodplains, with a few deviations to connect smaller villages along the way.” He drew with his finger along the map.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But without routine caravan traffic to fight back on fiend encroachment, once we withdrew the initial taskforce and began operation, five of the towers were abandoned within a week despite our best efforts.” He tapped the five locations on the map. “All told, <i>eighteen</i> workers suffered wounds requiring medical treatment, and one very nearly died. To speak nothing of supply shrinkage and general logistical inefficiency due to travel routes being not-at-all maintained.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda clenched her jaw and crossed her arms, not bothering to mask her frustration. If this project were to succeed, it would make sense to connect villages in the largest unincorporated population center with the second largest town at the earliest opportunity. But at the same time, it also had to be the longest, most costly of possible lines to construct. If it was anything but certain, why start there? She wasn’t sure whether to suspect malice or incompetence, but either way she now faced an uphill battle in arguing the project’s merits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus gave an exaggerated frown and looked to Amaurath. Zelda’s attention followed. Amaurath met the frown with one of his own, nodding solemnly. The old sage’s gaze fixed back to his hands resting on his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Oh, that was dirty. So now he was playing Amaurath against her too? Money was one thing, but now it was <i>personal</i>. Until now she had always inspired confidence in the Order, and had Amaurath’s ear in particular. Amaurath! Her own mentor!</span>
<br><br>
<span>The thought occurred to her that Sage Amaurath might not have asked Taetus here to begin with, except for Taetus’ scheming. Of course, Zelda couldn’t say as much, but the pattern fit too closely to be dismissed out of hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She would need to tread carefully, lest all of her <i>lofty, ill-advised projects</i> be curtailed in the name of <i>practicality</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus continued. “It is most unfortunate, Your Grace, but we cannot increase the number of operators without also increasing logistical costs beyond any reasonable expectation of sustainability. And stationing green mages, or even specialized forces along the lines would be counterproductive to say the least. Need I remind you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You <i>need not</i> remind me, Counselor,” Zelda interrupted. She was all-too aware her poise was slipping, and so took a moment to relax with a calm, measured breath. “Forgive me. Only, I did not anticipate such difficulties.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My apologies, Your Grace. I did not intend offense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda steepled her hands in thought. There had to be some way to recover this. “Can we increase taxes to cover the costs, and shift priority towards the least-costly lines to set up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus smile-frowned with a minute but rather pointed shake of his head. He dove into her query without missing a beat. “No, Your Grace. We cannot increase taxes at present. After two years of poor harvests, many farms are struggling to subsist, necessitating reductions in taxes if anything. An increase would likely lead to widespread insurrection. Perhaps if we are blessed with good harvests this year, and yields return to historical averages?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But even if that were not the case, it would not begin to cover the deficit in labor we would need to see towers adequately supplied and cleared at any scale. The project’s feasibility is predicated on paying for itself in time, and with that approach we would very nearly maximize operating costs prior to any possibility of returns. And before you ask: we cannot spare forces from Talus, and both Hylia’s Watch and Last Bastion are operating at minimal capacity already.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Blessedly, Anli arrived with the tea to a pair of gracious nods as he finished. Amaurath sipped at his in silence. Zelda unthinkingly downed hers in one long draught, motioning to have her cup refilled with a smile. Instant relief. The liquid was hot, but not so hot as to scorch her mouth or throat. Anli knew her well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus observed her impassively, though he made no comment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh. Whoops.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well, to damnation with appearances, Zelda thought, downing the second cup and motioning for a third. Anli complied, and hurried off to brew more. Amaurath very carefully did not notice the events, something in his pouches having come to occupy his attention.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Always one problem after another, after another. But so long as she kept solving problems, eventually progress would be made. <i>Eventually.</i> Her blessing was also her curse, it seemed. But she needed to get ahead of this, whatever <i>this</i> was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda focused her attention on Amaurath. Taetus made to interject but she held up a hand, and he fell silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sage Amaurath, I have a proposal,” she said. “What is your estimation of the feasibility of alternative constructions? Rather than wooden towers and encampments, we build fortified enclosures designed to eliminate the need for constant clearing. Two or three operators would live wholly inside the dwellings. Supplies would be restocked and personnel rotated through occasional resupply and relief missions, tasked to provincial Governors.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaurath nodded ponderously and took a few sips of his tea. “Mmm. Interesting. Unorthodox, but interesting. Less labor needed for operation, fewer mouths to feed, less raw logistical demand. It may work, yes. It seems the balance would hinge on construction costs and upkeep. But even then, at least the costs are mostly fixed upfront. Hmm… with the right materials and methods… yes. Plausible, though surely challenging.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Counselor Taetus,” Zelda said, drawing inspiration from Father. “Please record the Crown’s formal request to divert <i>half</i> of the remaining funds currently appropriated for the Blindscrier project towards researching the viability and restrictions of fortified towers operating in isolation. Expenses to be overseen by the Order of Sages. The remainder of the funds to be returned to the general account. I will personally work with the Order to see these problems resolved before we resume work on the Blindscrier project.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish, Your Grace. That is eminently reasonable.” Taetus said, making to take notes. An infuriating grin played at the edges of his mouth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was so thoroughly absurd. The project would continue in all but name, but at least this way—being seen to concede—she would not have to fight as hard to defend the project from Taetus and the other money-grubbing guays of the Council. If she had to, she would find some other pretense to construct the towers one at a time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Moving on.” Zelda smiled, as genuinely as she could manage. “Sage Amaurath, how goes the Greenery project?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was well known that magical affinity was at least partially hereditary, with affinity being more common and more potent among noble lineages. Zelda, being of royal blood, could trace her lineage back to Hylia herself, and thus had every affinity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Technically. Red magic was still difficult for her.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Confoundingly, however, attempts to breed stronger magical affinities or increase their prevalence by joining noble blood always fell short. It was as if the Goddesses themselves were looking, and refused to bestow any more of their divinity than they otherwise would. The Faith maintained that magical affinity was a blessing from the Goddesses themselves, and that those marked with their favor were destined for greatness. Zelda wasn’t sure what to make of that, but she supposed they had good enough reason for the belief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At any rate, it seemed they had overlooked certain types of vegetation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Using green magic, one could channel healing energies into some fruits, tubers, and other crops. The results varied wildly, but some species would grow faster, produce larger fruits, or become more resilient to pests and disease. Zelda’s idea was simple: cultivate these traits intentionally, and increase harvests. She wasn’t sure why it wasn’t done already, though her historical research suggested magical horticulture might be one of many arts lost to time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, yes. Good, good. Most delightful.” Amaurath sipped at his tea. Anli appeared to refill his cup just as it was running low, earning her a grateful smile. “The most recent batch remains between a fourth and third part more productive than ordinary cultivars.” He scratched at his beard. “Though, there have not been noticeable gains from the prior batch. …Nor prior to that, as you are aware.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Damnation</i>. Zelda was sure she had figured that one out. As of yet, the yields were not nearly enough to justify the use of green mages, though she was sure they would get there eventually.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. How unfortunate,” Zelda replied. “Well, there is always next year.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I may interject, Your Grace.” Tateus. Zelda nodded, though perhaps too curtly. At least she remembered to smile this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Might I suggest reducing the scope of this project?” His voice took on a nauseating affectation. Did he honestly think her as easily swayed as the bootlicking politicians competing to see which one could shove their nose furthest—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Temporarily, of course. At least until you are able to make further progress in your research. As you well know, there are many demands on Crown finances. However mundane, it is still necessary to insure caravans and maintain infrastructure. And the magic can—at least at present—be better used for healing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps it was the nightshade affecting her mood, but Zelda couldn’t find it within herself to remain incensed. He did have a point. Still, scaling back would introduce more variability within batches, making it that much harder to know when or even if she had made progress.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Though, she could also play his game.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sage Amaurath?” Zelda inquired, rolling her cup in hand. “What are your thoughts on the matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm? Oh, yes. A tough one,” Amaurath replied, drawing out the words. “The project does have astounding potential, and the older records do hint at precedent. Though even if you are successful, there still remains the problem of magical scarcity. In truth, I cannot say. I leave matters of decision and policy in more capable hands, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inwardly, Zelda sighed. So much for that. Truthfully, the most pertinent factor was that she was short on time to invest in additional research. There was just too much to be done—too much that required her immediate attention as of late. Still, she need not tell Taetus that. Let him believe he scored another win.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. We will put this project on hiatus for now. Please record the Crown’s formal request to return the funds to the general account.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched as Taetus took note while sipping her tea. To her surprise, she found the cup empty and Anli at her side offering her more. When had that happened? She shook her head, passing the cup along. She might have overdone it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Splendid news indeed, Your Grace,” Taetus said mirthlessly. “Though High Captain Thurdan informs us that, while assuredly impressive, Talus has no need for the siege engines at present. He says they are best suited to assaulting static fortifications. And while they may have been of great use historically, the devices cannot be used effectively against the Blin hordes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. When had they moved to discussing siege engines?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaurath nodded as he composed his response, with notably more vigor than before. “The prototype was constructed to specification, yes. It required a bit of trial and error and took a few iterations to get the gearworks right. But as per your sources, a single soldier could wind and operate the device… ah, though with some effort.” He met Zelda’s gaze with a glint in his eye. “I am pleased to report: it worked. Clean across the field!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh?” Zelda heard herself say. It was like she was watching the conversation unfold from a few seconds away, present in body but not in mind, her vision morphing and snapping in waves. Events were jumbling in her awareness; an effect of acute nightshade poisoning. She really did overdo it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She knew however that it was completely harmless, and that the best course of action was only to “watch” without attempting to “interfere.” Interfering would only make it worse. She would handle herself well enough, though perhaps she should find reason end the meeting sooner rather than later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes… quite.” Taetus replied, doing a poor job of hiding his frustration. He scribbled notes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Or perhaps not. Sooner, yes. Sooner would be better.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sage Amaurath, what of the siege engines? Did the smiths find my sketches workable?” Zelda heard herself ask. She affectionately traced a hand along Anli’s arm as the girl turned to leave. Anli’s eyes went wide and her cheeks red in surprise, though the men did not seem to take note.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That… was not appropriate. Zelda shook her head, trying to focus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Remarkable devices, yes. Truly remarkable. And… ah, terrifying to behold. Are you well, Your Grace?” Amaurath looked to Zelda, showing concern.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Splendid! That is splendid news indeed!” Zelda found herself saying, with quite a bit more enthusiasm than the situation called for. She was even waving her hands in elation. How embarrassing. Was that her reaction to Amaurath’s report?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, of course.” Zelda said, the words echoing in her ears. She had to fight to maintain focus. “Just… I was unsure of the completeness of the designs, given the sources, and am glad they bore fruit.” She felt herself blushing, and tried to cover it. “I assure you. I am fine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaurath nodded dutifully, content to accept her answer. Taetus simply smiled. Who knew what that man was thinking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. That is too bad,” Zelda’s voice said as she adopted a mock frown. “Too bad. Too bad. Well. On the upside, fewer expenses to worry about, as I’m sure you’ll be pos-it-ively <i>elated</i> to note, Taetus.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Amaurath took the lull as an opportunity to speak up. “Your Grace, perhaps we should continue at another time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, that is quite enough for now, I think.” Zelda said, rising from her seat. “Thank you for your time, Sage. It was a pleasure, as always.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The men hastened to rise to meet her. Amaurath bowed his head. Taetus stammered. “A pleasure as always, Your Grace!” he called after her, as she hurried up the stairs and away to her bedchamber.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“At arms, soldier,” Impa commanded as she entered the courtyard. A boy in Talus green—the newest recruit for the Royal Guard—snapped to arms with a salute. Good form.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waved to the guards on duty. “Dismissed.” They saluted, clearing the courtyard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa took a moment to assess the boy. Lean and fit. The usual, save for his age. She found that bit most interesting. He was the relative of some lord or another. Years of heroic service. Honorably discharged when he became more trouble than he was worth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At ease. Your skills?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shifted into a comfortable stance. “Ma’am. Tactical operations and reconnaissance. Primarily horseback, archery, and swordsmanship. Minor magical support; green. Baseline affinity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Qualifications?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seven years’ service at Talus. Squadron leader.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And he was twenty-two? Hmm. At face value it was not much to speak of, but to have such varied skill at his age suggested exceptional innate talent. He was driven. Good. She could use that. If he had another affinity, or if his green magic was stronger, he likely would’ve been chosen for the Sheikah. As it was, the world had precious little room for those like him. A pity he was not born in another age.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Words could only say so much. She would need to test his mettle herself before he could be accepted into the guard. A mock fight; she would not go full force.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa paced around his back to a training rack at the opposite side of the small courtyard. She selected a blunted sword and tossed it to him from behind. “Defend yourself!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just as the sword left her hands, she fell into a crouch. A torrent of red magic swirled in the air and coursed through her veins, augmenting her strength and pushing her reflexes well past her natural ability. The world slowed down as her senses sped up. She kicked against the ground, launching herself at her target. Gathering energy crackled in her palms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With surprising alacrity, the boy pivoted in place, snatching the sword from the air by the barest margin. Luck; he was a green mage after all. In the same motion, he used the momentum of his turn to coil on his right leg, leaping free of Impa’s charge. She missed him by mere inches.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa dug into the ground, arresting her momentum. She turned and— the maneuver had left him in position! Clearly, she underestimated him. He was not holding back; neither should she. She readied herself to counter the coming attack with might and magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He dropped his sword in an arc to deny her space. His next move would be to step in and swung through with a diagonal cut from above. To his credit, he had flawless form. But Impa had seen the technique a thousand times in drill. A light burst of energy to push the blade aside, and she would slam into him from below with a rising—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Faster than she could move, faster than she could <i>think</i>, the boy shifted. He <i>lunged</i>, using the impact of her burst to turn the blade mid-air, drawing the blunted edge against her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took her a full second to gather her wits. What had she just witnessed? <i>No one</i> had reflexes that fast. And in that second, the boy had recovered into stance, his sword leveled at her neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I yield,” Impa said, stepping out of range. Heart thumping in her chest, she bowed in acknowledgement of a superior opponent. What was his n—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lady Sheikah!” a voice called from behind. “A message!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa turned to see a courier waiting at the entrance to the courtyard. “A most excellent display,” she said to the boy, half distracted. “Well done.” She motioned for the courier to enter, taking his message in hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes ma’am. Thank you.” The boy said, standing at ease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa broke the seal and scanned the letter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, for the love of—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Urgent news. I must depart,” she said, turning to leave. “Go with the guard. They’ll see you properly outfitted. You’ll receive official orders in the morning.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ma’am.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Are you clear of mind?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Near enough</i>, came Zelda’s reply.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Outside.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Results?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No. Outside.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A tense and formless rage boiled within Impa’s chest, red and angry as the evening sun. She could do nothing about it, which only made it worse. She waited impatiently at Princess Zelda’s balcony.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside she heard giggling laughter and the rustling of clothing. One set of footsteps went to the door with a creak and a clack, while another strode to the balcony. The curtains drew back and Zelda opened the latch, cracking the glass door and peering through while clutching her nightgown.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa gave her a <i>look</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?” Zelda asked, rolling her eyes. “It’s not like Father’s going to chastise me. And besides, no one else cares.” She pushed the door a few inches further. Stepping back inside, she took a seat next to the hearth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa followed her in, closing the door and drawing the curtains back. She then turned on Zelda, one hand on her hip.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised her chin in defiance, eyes narrowing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa raised an eyebrow, lips drawing to a line.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blushed, looking away. She crossed her arms and threw one leg over the other.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa glared her displeasure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A tense silence hung between them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda broke first. “That bad, is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa grunted. “You’ve made quite the mess this time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll make up something,” Zelda said, waving a hand dismissively. “I’ll tell them it’s the stress getting to me. That I’m worried about Father.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s been four months,” Impa replied tersely. Mother Above, if this girl didn’t have the most brilliant mind in the kingdom. How she could simultaneously be so daft, only the Goddesses knew.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda snatched up the pillow next to her and buried her face to muffle a scream. Finished, she wound back and tossed it into the hearth. The fire roared to life, consuming the item and crackling furiously. A wave of heat washed over them. Impa had to admit it was somewhat satisfying to watch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waited for the flames to die down. “Taetus made the case that you were presently unfit for rule,” she said. “There were talks of declaring an interregnum.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scoffed. “Nonsense. That man may be a blight upon the kingdom, but the Council would never do such a thing. Father would—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Your father is as good as dead, Princess.” Impa said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do not interrupt me, Impa!” Zelda bit back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa stepped forward, arms crossed, and stood looming over her charge. Zelda shrunk back, hiding her face in her hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess,” Impa said. “You ordered me to be straight with you, always and in all things. To speak the truth, <i>even when it is inconvenient</i>. To never allow you to overrule me on the basis of authority.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry! I’m sorry, Impa. I know. I’m… I’m sorry,” Zelda said. She had tears in her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa took in a deep breath and held it until she had her frustration under control. It was clear the Princess still wasn’t quite herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A fleeting thought. On a whim, Impa decided to voice it before the moment passed. “Do not <i>apologize</i> to me, Princess,” she said sternly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda chortled her amusement even as she fought back the laughter, wiping her eyes. “Stop that,” she said. “This is serious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Princess. Very serious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda groaned. Impa allowed herself momentary grin as a reward for her complete yet magnanimous victory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A wistful sigh. “Do you think they’ll do it?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>During an interregnum, the Royal Council could lawfully appoint a regent to rule in the monarch’s stead; either the King’s Law or the King’s Justice in time of peace, or the Lord General in time of war. To be sure, there was no precedent for the current situation. The King was suffering from an unknown affliction from which it seemed he might never recover, and Zelda refused to assume the Crown despite Impa’s insistence. Declaring an interregnum would be a bold move, but not unlawful. If it came to pass, Zelda could not be crowned as Queen until another vote from the Council.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Adresin doesn’t have the spine,” Impa said. “ Nyllara might.” She shrugged. “It’s a distinct possibility. One that grows with every passing day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She and Taetus might as well be bedfellows,” Zelda said, making an obscene gesture. “It wouldn’t surprise me if they were.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa refused to acknowledge her remark.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What should I do, Impa?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa gaped at her, dumbstruck. Brilliant, but daft as a—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not yet ready to rule,” Zelda said, exasperated. “We’ve been over this. I always thought I’d have another twenty years <i>at least</i>.” She huffed, lowering her voice to a whisper. “All those times. If Father only knew how right he was. I should have listened.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you did not, and yet you find yourself here still,” Impa said. “You cannot change the past, Princess. You can only look towards the future.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know, I know.” She took in a breath, sitting upright. “Maybe I should abdicate.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She couldn’t be serious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked to her inquisitively.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother, she <i>was</i> serious. Goddess… “No, Princess. For one, you would be giving up on your projects.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cocked her head. “What, have we swapped places now? You know as well as I do that they aren’t going anywhere, despite my best efforts and despite what I try to tell myself. I have no talent for administration, only <i>lofty ideas</i> and <i>naive idealism</i>.” The mocking disdain in her voice showed clearly what she thought of those sentiments.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked away, fidgeting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa slid down to rest on her knees, placing her hands at the arm of Zelda’s chair. She couldn’t tell what the girl was thinking, but she had to convince her. She had to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess, you are the light this kingdom needs,” Impa said softly. “Your father was a strong ruler, but he did not have a tenth of the vision that you do. You need not fear. The Council will support you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stood, stepping away. “I can’t, Impa. I just… I’m not ready. It’s easy to have <i>vision</i>, but that doesn’t mean I have any idea what I’m doing. My whole life I’ve neglected my training, and I don’t have any real experience. If I took the Crown now, I would just lead the kingdom to ruin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You brilliant idiot,” Impa muttered under her breath as she rose to her feet. “Do you even listen to yourself? Since your father took ill, you’ve been having the <i>dreams</i> again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Zelda!” The rage was building again. Impa stalked towards her charge, stopping inches from the girl’s face. Zelda’s eyes went wide. She grabbed at the bracers on Zelda’s wrists, holding them in front of her face. “<i>The River Hylia running backward, waves crashing against the castle. A great shadow moving across the desert and over the ocean. A mountain rising in the east, and earthquakes shattering the land!</i>” Impa shook Zelda’s wrists, pleading with the Holy Mother Above to let the girl see reason.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pulled back, and she released her grip. Had she gone too far?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess,” Impa said in a calmer tone. “The Goddesses have put you in this position. <i>You</i>. These dreams are not mere dreams. You must see that. You are the only one who can save this kingdom. You must take the Crown, and you must lead your people. <i>Nayru’s wisdom will guide you.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda mouthed the words silently to herself, her eyes fixed on her bracers. The bracers which held the very embodiment of that wisdom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Impa,” Zelda said, drawing tall. “Come morning, gather a retinue. We’re going to visit the Zora.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Much later that night, Impa walked down a street and ducked into an alleyway under the cover of darkness. She came to a stop in front of a sturdy wooden door set into an iron frame. It had no handles and no obvious method of entry, save for a finger-sized hole on one side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a hooked finger, she reached inside and felt out a small pool of water. Closing her eyes, she visualized the keyform and the locking mechanism. An ice crystal grew from her fingertip as the form took hold, and she heard a faint click. The door creaked open.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room inside was an eight-by-eight foot square; featureless, musty, and dark. She entered, closing the door behind her and barring it shut with a wooden beam. From a pouch at her side, she produced a brightly glowing stone to see by, setting it into a socket in her hood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In the center of the room was a wooden trapdoor. Swinging it open, she made her way down, careful not to slip against the mossy footholds. Sounds of running water grew louder as she descended.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An archway at the bottom led to a long corridor that stretched out beyond sight. Along one side of its length ran a channel leading to a cistern. Along the other were iron doors arranged at regular intervals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Indistinct voices and sordid moans rose up from the darkness as she approached. Behind the doors were holding cells where she kept the test subjects. Ancient and long-forgotten; no one knew their original purpose.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda had pleaded with her to find a cure for her father’s affliction. As they knew nothing of the cause—save that it was anything but natural—the task had involved substantial trial and error. Needless to say, Zelda preferred to remain oblivious to the details, holding to a facade of ignorance and dealing only in the abstract. She was happy however to suggest new pairs of compounds and possible antidotes when Impa returned to her with the latest set of results.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa raised her mask to cover her nose and shield against the worst of the stench. She walked along the corridor, stopping at the fourth door on the left. Inside, she was greeted by one of the lesser dregs society had to offer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Back already? Fickin’ spume,” the man said, rattling his chains. His head drooped, half of his body having gone limp. He tried to spit, but his parched mouth only produced dry sputters. Dried blood had caked around his right wrist.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Larus.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m gonna get out o’ here,” he said in a rapsing voice. “You jus’ wait. I’m gonna get out o’ here, then I’m gonna fin’ ya, and I’m gonna fick ya. I’ll fick ya real good. Then I’m gonna kill ya, and then I’m gonna fick ya again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is that so?” Impa tisked. “I suppose you’ll have to hurry. You’re almost out of time.” She unsheathed her dagger, deliberately drawing it against the casing. She could smell his fear. Her blood rose and her pulse quickened; her pent-up rage transmuting to anticipation in her belly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They had given it their best, but to no avail. Now, she had to clean up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wha…” Larus’ right eye opened wide.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impa drew near her quarry, chained and helpless.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Larus yelled, kicking in futility. He tried and failed to get his working leg under him. “No! You—you stay away! Stay away from—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He cut off as Impa slid her dagger into his throat with a twist. She pulled, and was rewarded with gushing pulses of warm blood. He violently shook and strained against his bindings as the light faded from his eyes until at last the pulsing abated. Satisfied, Impa let his lifeless body slump against the wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had a long night ahead.</span>
