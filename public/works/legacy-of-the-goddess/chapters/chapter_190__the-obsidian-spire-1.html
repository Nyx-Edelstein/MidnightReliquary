<span>The Shifting Sands proved to be less of a challenge than Ari anticipated. </span>
<br><br>
<span>True to his visions, the wind steadily picked up as he and his team approached the marked location on the map, until it whipped about in a perpetual sandstorm. It wasn’t so bad as to be painful to exposed skin, but their visibility dropped to nearly zero mere minutes in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari knew that it was dangerous to attempt to navigate in such conditions; he had heard plenty of stories of people getting lost out in the woods and attempting to travel in a straight line, yet wandering aimlessly in circles for days until they ran out of water, died of exposure, or were simply eaten by Wulfkin. He had no reason to believe an unnatural, perpetual sandstorm to be any different.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fortunately, however, they had Ryn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn was able to scry ahead without issue and find the mountain pass from Ari’s visions. Using the compass Ari had on hand, they made it through the sands safely enough, taking care to stay together by looping a length of rope between their horses. Following that, it was only a couple hours’ ride up the winding pass before they reached their destination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They rounded the final bend, and ahead loomed the Obsidian Spire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Mother Above</i>,” Koja muttered off to Ari’s side. “You weren’t kidding. That thing is <i>huge</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>From the ground, five layers of sleek black rock rose up in a massive construction of concentric circles that narrowed towards the top. At the peak was an impossibly tall obsidian obelisk that jutted out against the sky in defiance of all reason. It was easily the tallest structure Ari had ever seen. From where he was standing, it even seemed to loom over the mountains in the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll say,” Ryn said, chiming in. “What in the blightlands <i>is</i> this place?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“An ancient structure built—probably by the Goddesses themselves—to seal away an otherworldly evil from beyond the Void,” Grenja said with confidence. “Obviously.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Obviously</i>,” Koja said in a mocking tone. “Try to keep up, Ryn.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pfft,” Ryn waved her off. She turned to Ari, bringing her horse to a halt a few strides ahead. “So. What shall we do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari scanned ahead. There was only one obvious entrance to the Spire: on the approach from the mountain path was a ramp with a slight incline heading down into the structure, and at the end of the ramp were two massive stone doors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>First thing first.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We should check around for other entrances,” Ari said. “Scout the area. Make sure there aren’t any surprises.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Roger,” Ryn said with a salute, turning her horse and trotting ahead. Ari and the others followed closely behind.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A few minutes later they circled back to the front entrance. Other ways in, if there were any, were not apparent. Grenja had the idea to try and scale the walls, but even that proved futile. The smooth stone walls were incredibly hard, and even he barely managed to make a scratch with the tools they had on hand. There was nothing to hook ropes to in order to climb, and even the first level of the structure was a good ten meters taller than the nearest cliffs (which it didn’t help were several tens of meters away).</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn had also scried around the area. She found precisely nothing of interest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Welp,” Koja said. “Guess that settles it. Only one way in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Horses?” Ryn asked, turning to Ari for direction.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I guess we’ll have to tie them up by the doors,” Ari said with a shrug. There wasn’t anywhere else to leave them. “Let’s get to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The party dismounted. Ari threaded a short rope through his horse’s bridle and passed it along. Koja tied them off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja grabbed at the rings of the massive stone doors and pulled. There was a loud <i>creak</i>, but they gave way without too much effort. Resolved, the party headed inside with Grenja taking point. Ari and Koja would keep Luck up on him and the rest of the group at all times. Null could restore their magic as necessary. Ryn brought up the rear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The party entered, ready for anything.</span>
<br><br>
<span>After his eyes adjusted to the dim light, Ari found himself in a two-tiered grand vestibule—or at least, what had once been a grand vestibule. Most surfaces were covered in a thin layer of sand and dirt, with larger piles near the corners, walls, and entrance. Murals on the walls depicting the Holy Mother and her Lightsworn armies had been defaced. Half-melted candles on small braziers littered the walkway and benches to either side, and a blood-stained altar with various sacrificial implements rested in front of an ornate door at the end of the hall above.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An ornate door that had been smashed and bent-in by a force Ari could only imagine possible. The two halves of the metal door curled inward towards the bottom, as if they had been forced open with a battering ram—or even a blasting charge.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>That</i> was likely the location that held the remnants of Mor Kharath’s avatar. Ari knew from Shesan that Mor Kharath did not pose any danger. Given that he also knew Azahndor had visited this location in the past, it stood to reason the damaged door was likely the Exiled King’s doing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>From where they stood, closer to the entrance, were two hallways leading off to the left and the right. The easternmost hall ended a couple meters in at a stone wall covered in blue runes with a circular inset at its center. It appeared to be vaguely door-shaped, but there were no obvious ways of entering or opening it. The western hall was open, and led out into a small corridor that receded into darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Looks like someone else got here first,” Grenja said, pointing ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>No</i>,” Koja said sarcastically. “You think?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, just voicing my thoughts,” Grenja said. “Someone had to say it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Quiet. Focus,” Ari commanded in a hushed tone. They couldn’t afford to take any risks. “Ryn: caltrops and bells. East and north. Eyes on the entrances. Grenja: take point west. Koja on me. Ryn bring up the rear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn wasted no time, doing as instructed. The other two nodded and moved as Ari ordered. Koja held a lantern up high as they went. Ari drew his sword.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Halfway along the western corridor Ari saw a stone wall similar to the blue one to the east; identical in almost all respects, except this one had red runes. A statue of the Mother Goddess stood at the end of the corridor. It appeared to be offering up a blue gem. A gem that was roughly the shape of the circular inset from the eastern wall, and exactly the same shade of blue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That <i>has</i> to be a trap,” Koja said. “How has no one taken that by now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t see any bodies,” Grenja said. “No blood, no bones.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t like it,” Koja said warily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari edged closer and got a good look at the red runes on the wall. They didn’t look like any writing he was familiar with. “Do any of you know what these mean?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nope.” / “Negatory.” / “Not me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null, can you make sense of these?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null’s chromatic form—teal and purple shimmering softly—materialized to Ari’s side. She turned to face the runes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative,” she answered after a moment of study. “They do not correspond to any language, cipher, or code that I am aware of. However, I conjecture they may be magical in nature. Analysis indicates high probability.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Ari said aloud. Magic runes? He unclasped the stone disc at his belt. “Can you activate the tablet for me? Easy does it; don’t waste any more power than absolutely necessary. I just want to confirm your theory.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish,” Null said with a quick pirouette. A single thin stream of iridescent chromatic vapor—teal shifting to purple—flowed from her to the stone. It vibrated weakly in Ari’s hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He held it up next to the runed wall. It vibrated more firmly. He turned to the statue of Avalia at the far side of the hall and took three steps. The vibration weakened, and then grew much stronger before falling still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Old magic,” Grenja said. “Who’d’ve guessed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I still don’t like it,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null, can you ask Xayla about the runes?” Ari asked. “Maybe get her to ask Shesan too, if she doesn’t know anything?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly. However, I have no way of conveying the specific shapes or other relevant details of the runes other than verbal descriptions. I do not expect this exercise to be productive.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Good point. “Well then, just see if Xayla can ask Shesan if she knows anything. Shesan mentioned she’s been here before.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One moment,” Null said. She hummed softly and her hues shifted from teal to purple to rose in measured pulses.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, and can someone copy down those runes?” Ari said. Might as well do something useful while they waited for a response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“On it,” Koja said, fishing out ink and paper from her pack. She knelt in front of the wall and got to work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla says Shesan has no pertinent information regarding the runes,” Null said after a few minutes’s pause.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That figured. Ari looked ahead to the gem, then back to the entrance to the corridor. “Doesn’t look like we have many options,” he said. “The gem or the smashed-up door?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I vote the smashed-up door,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Either’s good with me,” Ryn said from behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m good with whatever you decide,” Grenja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded. “Door first, then. Let’s make sure there aren’t any other threats in here to worry about. Ryn: traps in front of the red wall too. Can’t be too careful. Null: keep your avatar active for the next hour at least. We might need you again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish,” Ryn said, imitating Null with a clumsy pirouette. Ari let out a snort of laughter despite himself, and the others had a good chuckle too. Null twirled in mid-air, as if to show her how it was properly done.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That kind of relationship, huh?” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey. Mind your own business,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>When Ryn was done, the team headed back to the main area and up the half-flight of stairs, then ducked under the broken ornate door and into the cavern within.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A short hall opened into an absolutely colossal room full of sand. Four enormous stone pillars held up a dome overhead. The room was decently lit, with the dome letting through the light of the midday sky—but something about that was <i>very</i> off. For one, Ari was absolutely certain the surface of the dome was <i>inside</i>, and was not in fact open to the sky <i>outside</i>. Where the heck was that light coming from?</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the center of the colossal room was a correspondingly large carapace of what Ari could only describe as a really huge and terribly nasty-looking worm-thing, that could probably eat an oxgoat whole. Just as Shesan said, it was very, very dead, and the carapace was entirely hollow. The middle half was buried in sand, leaving only the head and tail exposed. From his estimates it had to be at least fifteen meters long, and probably three and a half meters wide.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Freaky,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No joke,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait,” Grenja said. “So you’re telling me Azahndor killed <i>that</i>?” He gave a low whistle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, not looking forward to that fight,” Koja opined. “That guy might be more than we bargained for.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari tried not to think too much about that right now. “Null, notice anything unusual?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative. Towards the center of the room lies the remains of an improbably large annelidoid creature. Also, the ceiling is unusually luminous.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn and Koja chuckled. Ari slapped his forehead. “I mean, can you do an analysis of the worm-thing?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null danced and spun around the room in flowing, methodical patterns, gliding over and under the carapace a few times with her form tilting at various angles as if examining it from every perspective. The team watched and waited in anticipation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Visual analysis complete,” Null said after a moment. “All observations are consistent with the hypothesis that these remains were once the avatar of Mor Kharath—by Shesan’s description, a powerful Void entity. Further, the remains do not correspond with any species I am aware of. Unfortunately I have no additional information to offer at this time, and protocol prohibits further speculation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari frowned. “But we know it’s probably related to Old Magic, right? I mean, isn’t that a safe bet?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Correct,” Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So given that, can’t you make any other guesses about the nature of Mor Kharath’s avatar? I mean, it sounds like something you could work with Xayla to research, and maybe even reproduce.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I understand your confusion,” Null said. “Allow me to clarify: I am not ruling out the possibility of further research; however, postulating ‘Old Magic’ or ‘the avatar of a powerful Void entity’ as explanations for the creature’s improbable size and other unusual characteristics offers only marginal utility over the ignorance hypothesis; that is, such postulates do not allow me to refine my models towards greater predictive specificity, nor do they meaningfully alter the results of any prior numerical estimates. In summary: I presently am unable to offer any novel insight, other than to confirm the remains are likely unnatural. If you would like, I can do an active magical analysis of the remains for residual energies, though I do not expect positive results given the time elapsed since the creature’s supposed death.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded slowly, trying to follow along. “Yes, please do,” he said. “Might as well, just to be sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null turned back to the creature and hummed faintly as thin strands of prismatic energy—teal and purple interweaving in geometric patterns—trailed from her to the carapace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Maybe we should take some physical samples too?” Ryn suggested. “Might help. For research, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure, yeah.” Ari said. “Can’t hurt. Null, will that interfere with your analysis?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja grunted and approached the carapace. With some effort, he pried off a few small sections and stuck them in an empty bag. “That good?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shrugged. “Good enough. I mean, we can’t haul the whole thing back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Analysis complete,” Null said after about a minute. “As expected, I do not detect any residual magical energies.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari sighed. So much for that. “So, uh. What about the ceiling?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null glanced upward. She hesitated for the briefest of instants. “It is unusually luminous for an internal structure. To satisfy your query, would you like for me to examine it more closely, or should I provide you with a more detailed summary of my observations?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari furrowed his brow and scratched his chin. He thought that maybe perhaps he was beginning to see the shape of how Null thought about things. “Do you think examining it more closely would help? To understand it better, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So in other words… it looks the same to you as it does to us? I mean, just like light from the sky, but otherwise you don’t know anything more about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null zipped over and leaned in close. Uncomfortably close, as if to study Ari himself. Ari stood his ground, but leaned back an inch or three. He looked into her solid, unblinking, expressionless eyes, and saw himself reflected in them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To use familiar language, I would characterize your statement as ‘more or less accurate,’” Null paused, retreated, and spun once—twice. “To clarify: the light is significantly dimmer than that of the sky. It is however the same color as the sky. Precisely so, in a way that is difficult to describe in your language using terms you understand. Do you find this answer satisfactory?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari knew what that meant. He could ask her to try and explain in more detail, but he’d just hear a bunch of nonsense. “No, I <i>think</i> I get it,” he said. He paused, scratching his head. “Sorry, I’m just trying to understand how you see things. So—would you let me know of your own accord if you did see something interesting? I mean, if it were something that, uh… caused you to refine your models or change your estimates?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, Master,” Null said. “That is standard protocol. I should note however that Xayla has requested on multiple occasions for me to both raise the threshold of importance of and to lower the frequency with which I supply updates. As per her instructions, I will endeavour not to distract you with information you may find extraneous. At the same time I do not wish to dissuade you from asking if you are ever in doubt. If nothing else, you may draw my attention to information, items, or phenomena I have previously neglected to consider in finer detail. This has happened on several occasions during my time with you and Xayla.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, really? How so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The most pertinent example: I am able to use my superior sensory perceptions to note details such as stress response activation, hormonal changes, and involuntary facial muscle contractions. By noting where these observations deviate from predictions of baseline behavior, I am able to provide you with contextual information relating to subtle emotional shifts, attempts at deception, and other such behavioral phenomena. Prior to Xayla’s inquiry, I had not considered this information would be useful to you in any capacity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded. That made sense. “Okay. Thank you, Null. I think I get it. I’ll try to keep all that in mind. And I really appreciate your help.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am happy to provide assistance.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err, Ari?” Grenja said. “I hate to interrupt—I mean, that’s interesting and all, but—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yeah, sorry,” Ari said with an uneasy smile. “Let’s get back to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The team spent several more minutes exploring the room, but found nothing else of note.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Back to the gem, then?” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t think we have much choice,” Ari said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja groaned. “Can we at least poke it with a pole from a safe distance first?”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ari warily approached the statue at the end of the west corridor. Per Koja’s insistence, he extended a long pole (really it was two midsized camping poles tied together) and prodded the stone statue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He prodded the gem, making sure to lift it an inch or two from its resting place. Several times.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” Ryn said. “Not trapped?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I still don’t like it,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari set aside the pole and ventured towards the statue. Carefully, he reached up and poked the gem, then retreated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked back to the group. Grenja gave him a thumbs up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Steeling himself, Ari—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait!” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari turned back just as Koja caught up to him and placed her hand on his shoulder. He felt a brief tingling, indicating she reapplied Luck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just in case,” she said. “You never know. Might have worn off.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded. Better safe than sorry. He waited for her to withdraw to a safe distance. Stealing himself, he turned and took the blue gem from the hands of the statue, ready to bolt for it at the first sign of danger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He inspected the gem, lofting it in one hand as he returned to the group. It was much heavier and denser than it looked, and the light from the lanterns sparkled and reflected in complex patterns on its surface.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That sure is something,” Grenja half-whispered, bending over to take a good look. “May I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded. “Yeah, go ahead.” Grenja ran a finger—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>YEEOUCH!</i>” he cried, jerking back and sticking his finger to his tongue. “What the heck, man?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?!” Ari said, pulling the gem back and stepping away. “What’s wrong?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How can you even touch that thing? Holy Mother Above—it’s <i>ficking hot!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err… no it isn’t?” Ari examined the gem again, rubbing his hand over the surface. It was uniformly cool to the touch, and hadn’t changed in any way—even where Grenja touched it. “Null, notice anything different?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Must be his magical Lightsworn powers,” Koja said confidently.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I guess that would explain why no one else has taken it yet,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, <i>you</i> managed, didn’t you?” Koja said, giving her a nudge. “What do you think, Ryn? Wanna give it another go?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Koja—” Ryn rolled her eyes, placing a hand on her hip. “That’s not even a good joke. Look, if you’re going to tease me about ficking his brains out, at least—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Girls!</i>” Grenja chided. “Come on! We’re better than this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari cleared his throat. “Maybe we should try the blue-runed wall?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh yeah,” Koja said cattily. “I bet you’re just <i>dying</i> to slide your gem into that socket.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja groaned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just stop while you’re ahead,” Ryn said, covering her face. “You’re embarrassing yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja giggled. Ari took point, hurriedly leading the way back down the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ari neared the blue-runed wall, checking once more with the others. To his right, Grenja gave a thumbs up. Koja and Ryn stood a few paces back, each giving him a nod in turn. Null hovered off to the side, doing Null things.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari held the gem up to the inset at the center and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The gem leapt from his hand and snapped into place with an audible <i>click</i>. The blue runes flashed and disappeared as the gem pulsed and spun in a half-turn clockwise. An echoing rumble, and the wall raised upward into the ceiling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stepped back, exchanging glances with Grenja. He looked more closely at the frame. The fit was seamless; had he not just seen the stone panel rise up, he would have never suspected there had been a door here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja whistled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fancy,” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seriously, what even is this place?” Ryn asked rhetorically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, there looked to be a corridor much like the western one, receding into darkness as the far end. Ari drew his sword. Holding his lantern high, he stepped through into the—</span>
<br><br>
<span>A resounding <i>vwoom!</i> echoed from behind. Ari spun. A shimmering golden barrier stood between him and the others.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What the—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I regret to inform you that due to potent magical interference, my assistance will be limited in this area,” Null said from the other side. “I will still be capable of observation and direct telepathic communication, but I will be unable to manifest an avatar or channel my other abilities while you are within. I recommend proceeding with a greater degree of caution.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh… um… hmm…” Grenja articulated, poking at the barrier. “Hey, uh, Ari? It won’t let me through.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s wits caught up to him and he scrambled back, poking the barrier with the tip of his sword. It offered no resistance, and faded away as soon as he stepped back to the other side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned and poked his sword back the other way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stepped through again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari looked back to Grenja, handing the man his sword. “You try?” Grenja extended it and—<i>vwoom!</i>—it bounced and slid off to the side as it made contact.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” he and Grenja said in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari reached through and took back his sword. No resistance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja let out a sigh, waltzing up and pressing past her brother. He made way, and she poked at the barrier. “Yep, same for me,” she said. “Figures. Looks like you’re on your own from here, Ari.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh <i>come on,</i>” Ryn said dejectedly. “I was looking forward to this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari rubbed his face. Of course. Why had he ever thought he could bring a squad of elite Veilwyrd as backup into a place that was obviously intended only for Lightsworn?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, don’t sweat it,” Grenja said with a big grin. “You’re the singular most badass guy in the kingdom, Ari. You got this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Try not to get into too much trouble, yeah?” Koja said. “And come back to base camp right away if you get anything more than a scratch. Lightsworn or no, my healing is still much stronger than yours. I don’t want to have to stitch you up later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Base camp?</i>” Grenja said flatly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja shrugged. “Sounds cool? Gotta call it something.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja gave a noncommittal grunt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Really?</i>” Ryn said. “We’re going to give up, just like that?” She shook her head in disgust. “Look, maybe we can find a way to disable it. Null, can you tell us anything else about the barrier?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative,” Null said. “Current observations preclude all existing models.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Meaning…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do not understand this phenomenon, and I have no relevant information to share at this time,” Null said. “Additionally, the effects of the field are interfering with my perception.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fick,” Ryn muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really? You’re going to give up that easily?” Koja parroted back at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, you have any other ideas?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They all looked to Ari. He shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not just Null, by the way,” Ryn said. “Our magic doesn’t work through the barrier either.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari looked to her quizzically. “How do you know that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because you didn’t hear what I just sent you telepathically.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja snickered.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Can you hear me?</i> Ari tried.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep,” Ryn said. “Heard that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“An update,” Null said. “I must amend my previous statement. I do not believe your companions will be able to traverse the barrier. I believe your ability to do so—and also your ability to use magic despite the interference—is likely related to the changes to your essence as a result of the Lightsworn initiation ritual.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Uh, yup</i>,” Koja said. “That much is obvious, Null. ‘A’ for effort though.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, that <i>is</i> important,” Ryn said. “You just aren’t paying attention.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, what?” Koja asked, giving her a look. “You’re talking about what Null just said, right? You sure we heard the same thing?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Ryn said. “But it isn’t just <i>what</i> she said. What caused her to say that? She saw Ari using magic. Think about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari held up his sword. His still faintly-glowing-blue, imbued sword. “Huh. Why does that still work?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unknown,” Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why does what still work?” Grenja asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My sword?” Ari waved it around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja gawked at him incredulously for a moment before his face went pale. “Oh, fick. Fick!” He turned to Koja. “That barrier must’ve scrambled his brains! You can fix that, right? Please tell me you can fix that!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? No, I’m fine. My—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, you <i>dolt</i>,” Koja said, rolling her eyes. “I can’t heal scrambled brains. And his brains aren’t scrambled. He means—why’s it still imbued?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er…” Grenja scratched his head, turning back to Ari. “Why wouldn’t it be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because I didn’t imbue it?” Ari said. “Ryn did.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, why’s Ryn imbuing <i>your</i> sword?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Isn’t it obvious?” Koja said. “It’s because she’s imbuing his <i>other</i>—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Because I’m better at it,” Ryn interrupted. “More practiced, and I have more magic. My imbues last a lot longer than his. Given that Null can restore all of our magic through Ari, it makes sense practically.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Alright,</i>” Grenja said slowly. “But I still don’t get it,” he said. “We already know Ari can use magic past the barrier. Is it all that big of a deal that he can carry magically imbued items through too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, it’s probably not anything important right now,” Ryn said, brushing aside a strand of hair. “But it does tell us something about Imbue. The magic, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And that is?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s fundamentally different from Telepathy. And probably the other magics too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still not followin’.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn sighed. “Watch.” She stepped forward and pressed against the barrier. It wouldn’t let her pass. She summoned a thin ice crystal, which shattered as soon as it made contact. She unsheathed a short knife at her side—a knife she had imbued—and tried to push it past the barrier. It glanced and slid off the surface.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here,” she said, holding out the dagger hilt-first. “Take it, Ari.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari took it and held it up. It still glowed with a faint blue tinge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” Grenja said. “Well I’ll be damned.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null zoomed up to float inches over Grenja’s head, peering down at him from an angle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey—cut that out!” He swatted at her, but his hand passed right through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Apologies,” Null said. “It was not my intention to upset you. I will continue to observe from a more socially appropriate distance.” She floated about six feet away and continued to peer down at him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, Ari?” Koja said. “You probably want to use your own Luck from here. Just to be safe.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can’t we test that?” Ari said, wrinkling his brow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not really,” Koja said. “Luck usually doesn’t work if you try to exploit it or rely on it, and even then we couldn’t be sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right,” Ari muttered, scratching his head.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The team spent the next few minutes shifting around contents of backpacks until Ari had most of the the more generally useful items that would fit in his pack. They also did some testing around the barrier to confirm their suspicions, and had Null top off their magic afterward.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Foretelling wasn’t affected by the barrier—or rather, Ryn had similar success rates for divining results of coin flips on either side. There was no real way to test Scry, Luck, or Invigorate. Soothe did not work past the barrier; however, Koja was able to heal a small cut on Ari’s finger when he extended his arm back through. Siphon did not appear to be affected either—though it also required Ari to stick a hand through, so no surprise there. No type of Bursting was able to penetrate the barrier, and physical force was right out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>After they noted the results and communicated them back to Xayla—she would undoubtedly be interested to hear them—Ari decided to press on ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Holding his torch high, he proceeded down the dark corridor. A ways down the hall on his right was a short recess with another stone door. Unlike the previous ones, this one’s runes were white, and it had no circular inset at its center.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the far side of the corridor, to the north, appeared to be some kind of lever or switch. Above it was two exposed gears.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I am unable to make any determinations aside from strictly visual observations. I do not see anything out of the ordinary. It appears to be a simple switch and gear mechanism.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari approached it warily, inspecting the mechanism under his lantern’s light. The gears appeared to be ordinary gears in all respects, about eight inches in diameter. Ari gave them an experimental tug. They rested firmly on their spokes, but gave just the tiniest bit. With a bit of lantern oil and a little more force he could probably pry them loose. They were likely necessary for the operation of the mechanism however, so he let them be.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Holding his breath, he pulled the switch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The gears spun and the lever returned to its original position with a ratcheting <i>click click click</i> as soon as he let it go. There was a rumbling sound just behind, in the direction of the stone door. Ari spun to check it, sword at the ready.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The door was now open. Ari peered through to see a dark, winding corridor stretching off into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn was right. What in the blightlands was this place?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Whatever it was, he had no choice but to continue on into the darkness.</span>
<br><br>
