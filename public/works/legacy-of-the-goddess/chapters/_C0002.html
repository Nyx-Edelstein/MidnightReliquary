<span><i>Hylia—Goddess Above! Please, don’t let it end like this!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s world exploded in a flash of prismatic light. All at once, her awareness expanded a thousand-fold, her fear and fatigue faded to nothing, and she felt her magic restored. Raw and pure energy now <i>surged</i> within her, filling her to the brink and <i>yearning</i> to be unleashed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, the assassins advanced.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda reached out, moving as if guided by an unseen hand. She spread her fingers, channeling the energy within as if it were an extension of her own self. Crystalline clarity; a breath, and a thought. Hundreds of razor-sharp spines shot from the ground, rending the assailants asunder. An instant later the crystals shattered, and what remained of their lifeless bodies dropped to the floor in a growing pool of blood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And just like that, it was over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Astoundingly, Zelda felt no drain on her reserves. This rushing power was <i>limitless</i>. And with childlike fascination, she marveled at the sight: her skin now glowed with a golden aura.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The guardsman at her side fell to his knees. “O Hylia!” he cried in reverence. “Holy Mother!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you serious?” Zelda regarded him, trying and failing to maintain her composure. She laughed, brushing tears from her eyes. How absurd! Her prayer was literally answered, and now this? Surely he had more—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Zelda,” a voice spoke from behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Eep!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda jumped and spun, clutching at her chest. Before her, a feminine form floated in the air. Radiant, ethereal, divine. She wore a billowing cloak that seemed to drift on the aether. With a gasp, Zelda too fell to her knees.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Interesting,” the floating figure said. She had no arms that Zelda could see, yet she still managed to convey the <i>very idea</i> of touching her chin in thought.  “It seems I provoked your adrenal stress response. Calibrating. I will endeavor to avoid such in the future.” And now that she was paying attention, Zelda realized that her mouth didn’t move when she spoke either. The words simply <i>echoed</i> in her mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hylia?” Zelda asked tentatively, raising an eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. I now understand the nature of your confusion,” the ethereal entity replied. “Allow me to clarify: I am Fi, Emissary to Her Grace, the Goddess Hylia.” She spun midair in an exaggerated pirouette. “Her Grace has sent me to provide guidance to you on your quest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My quest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative. Your quest. Please, do not be alarmed at the next event.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>"Yes, Your Grace!" the guardsman yelled, rising and taking off at a sprint.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite herself, Zelda started and rose to her feet. <i>What even was happening anymore?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what, pray tell, is my quest?” she asked hesitantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Her Grace wishes me to relay a message. Please, listen closely.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With some uncertainty, Zelda nodded. Fi drew tall, tilting her head towards to the heavens and spreading her absence-of-arms wide. She pulsed, and a new voice echoed in Zelda’s mind. Gentle, motherly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda, my child,” the voice said. “Your people need you. They fight and die as we speak. Rally the armies; they await you in the courtyard. Then go ahead of them to the northwest gate. You will find a soldier there; lend him your aid. You will know of whom I speak. Use my blessing, and bring the fight to the enemy. I have done all I can, and entrust the rest to you. Heed the words of Fi; she will provide you with council. Do you accept my charge?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace!” Zelda cried.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi settled back into what seemed like a more relaxed posture. Zelda looked to her expectantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, I recommend against waiting any longer. The situation sounds exceedingly dire.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wh—but you—gah!” Zelda threw her arms in the air in dismay. No use arguing. “Fine. What do you recommend, Fi?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Calculating.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? We don’t have—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I believe a ballistic trajectory to be the fastest approach. Five-point-oh-three by zero-point-nine-two radians from your current heading, at approximately fourty-eight meters—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Fi, stop!” Zelda said, waving her hands. “I can’t…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She couldn’t <i>what</i>? She spun around, looking up and to her left.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A window.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Experimentally, Zelda drew on her green affinity, gathering up all the magic she could muster and forcing it into an updraft of air. A gale-force wind whipped through her clothes and hair, but she remained firmly planted on the ground. She tried again—this time while jumping and leaning forward—but only managed to go careening off to the side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, that wasn’t going to work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, an update: I believe your aerodynamic properties to be insufficient for flight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Fi! I am well aware.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. She was overthinking this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned back to the window and let loose a gust of wind. It shattered easily, leaving her plenty of wiggle-room. Carefully—her blue magic was <i>much</i> stronger than her green—she summoned up a tide of water beneath her feet at an angle. It carried her a ways into the air, and she plopped back down harmlessly into another surge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It worked! Of course, she was soaked through now. But that didn’t matter; it would fade soon enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, I have updated my calculations to account—” Zelda tried interrupting her with a splash of water. It only phased through, however, and Fi continued unperturbed. “—for variables previously omitted in order to simplify the model. To save on time, I now suggest a more orthodox—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda screamed. Did this <i>emissary</i> ever stop talking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am detecting abnormally high levels of frustration. Would you prefer I remain—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yes,</i> Fi. <i>Yes</i>,” Zelda said, flustered. She took a breath, calming herself. “I’ve got this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed the window, lining up the angle. “Okay,” she said under her breath. “One… two…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A surge of water propelled her up and out, and she held her breath as the window zoomed toward her. She hurtled through the air, clearing it much faster than anticipated. The thrill of it was amazing! But now she was now heading directly for a stone wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Scrambling, she judged her approach and summoned a surge to dampen her momentum, and another to fling her further out. However, she was not expecting the jet of water that shot up her nose. That threw off her concentration, and she went veering off course to tumble headfirst over roof.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Owww.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rose to her feet and wiped the dirt from her face. Well, that was extremely careless of her—but no matter; with Hylia’s blessing, she it seemed she was wholly uninjured. She stretched and flexed. One final surge (more carefully aimed this time) propelled her the rest of the distance, and with a gentle splash she landed neatly within the staging grounds to an assemblage of soldiers awaiting her arrival.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except she was still sopping wet. And they had presumed, quite reasonably, that she would be arriving from the castle, and not dropping in from the sky. How embarrassing. She probably should have thought this through. Gasps and cries of shock rang out through the crowds as she hastily rung the worst of it out of her hair and clothing. What a sight she must have been!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess! Are you alright?” Wymar dashed through the crowds and to her side, eyes wide. He stopped abruptly, gaping in awe as he approached.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, the Lord General! Just who I wanted to see,” Zelda said, with a confidence she wasn’t sure she felt. “So, an update: it seems that Hylia has anointed me as her champion… and has commanded me to rally our forces and bring the fight to the enemy!” She gave him a beaming smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar only stammered incoherently.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know, I know. I’m still coming to grips with it myself.” Zelda rubbed her palms together and bit at her lip. “Say, could you handle giving the troops a rousing speech for me? There’s something else I’m supposed to do first.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda surged through the air overhead, zipping past soldiers in the midst of a hasty and disorganized retreat. More than a few stopped to gawk at her, but she paid them no mind. She had work to do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She came to a stop on the roof of a building as she drew near to the gate. She was wholly unprepared for what she saw: carnage; raw, and unbridled. The stench was unbearable. Bodies lay strewn throughout the streets—Blin and Hylian alike. Nowhere could she look without seeing dismembered corpses and entrails.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sight should have made her sick, but she was so far past that now. Now, she felt only <i>hate</i>. Hate, and loathing for the vile creatures that dared to bring this blight upon her realm. Upon her <i>home</i>. She would not forget this. She could never forget this, and neither would they. They would <i>pay</i>, and dearly for what they had done.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This… this would be the Blight to end all Blights. She would see to that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, a throng of the wretches were gathered in a large circle. They were chanting. Cheering. Raving. Zelda observed them from afar with disgust.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>How dare they celebrate.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A lone soldier caught her eye, standing in their midst and facing down two lumbering giants. The bodies of at least three other soldiers and several Blin lay at his feet nearby. Was this the one she was meant to save?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man ducked under a swing from one of the brutes and rammed his sword into the skull of the other. His sword caught as he tried to pull it free, and he staggered back—but too late. The one left standing tackled him to the ground, and began savagely ripping at his chest with claws and teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“NO!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda flew into a frenzy, launching herself from the roof. Hylia’s divine power resonated with her wrath, <i>demanding</i> to be unleashed. She obliged, hurling dense balls of rolling flame into the throng. Their cheers turned to howling pain as bodies were engulfed. Dozens fell screaming before her; blackened and charred bodies piling up. She did not relent. Zelda surged over the mass, raining down death from above. She landed at the far end to cut off their escape, and drew on every last ounce of magic in her blood to send continuous streams of jagged spikes flying in all directions. She was a goddess unto herself now; one of hail, blood, death, fire, and <i>vengeance</i>. Her whole body shook with strain, and everything that moved, died.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Exhausted from the effort, she fell to her knees. It seemed even with Hylia’s boon, she had limits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was she too late? Who was this man that Hylia sent her specifically to aid? She scanned the mass of bodies for where she last saw him, and… there! His attacker had collapsed on top of him. Zelda ran to him, trying and failing to heave the body aside. She had to resort to magic, but with a carefully aimed gust, the task was done.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man sputtered, coughing up blood. His tunic was torn to shreds and soaked through. She wasted no time, tearing away his tattered clothing and drawing on her magic. Green energies swirled in her hands and she pressed them to his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man met her eyes, reaching out for her. “Hy… Hylia,” he struggled to say, “Why… why have you forsaken… agghh!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…No! No, no, no! Zelda drew back as the man shook violently with pained and broken moans. She watched helplessly as the gashes in his chest ripped themselves back open and dark blood seeped through. This couldn’t be happening! Hylia wouldn’t have… why would she send her here if… if she couldn’t…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress,” Fi’s voice echoed in her mind. Zelda nearly jumped out of her skin in surprise, not expecting to find the specter floating at her side. “I have information you may find useful. Would you like—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For the love of the Mother, Fi! Just tell me how I can save him!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your magic is capable of healing spiritual wounds, such as that inflicted by what you call ‘bloodrage.’ You need only try harder.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gawked at her. “Seriously?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative. I estimate a ninety-nine point seven percent chance he will still require extensive medical care, but in your current state you should have more than sufficient magic to prevent his death.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Mother Above</i>,” Zelda muttered under her breath, turning back to the man. She scrambled to gather up her magic again, only for him to writhe and struggle under her, batting her hands away. His cries of pain were too much for her to bear, but she could not fail the goddess now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen to me, you damned fool!“ she said with tears in her eyes, trying in futility to wrestle him still. “I don’t know… who you are, but Hylia—<i>herself</i>… sent me—here to save you, now—<i>urgh!</i>” It was no use; his mind was too far gone. He would not listen, and she had not the strength to force him down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She gave up in favor of another strategy—one of the lesser-used green magics. Would this work? She didn’t know, but she had to try. Zelda pulled back, resting on her knees in front of the man. She steadied her breathing and closed her eyes. Her nerves were on edge, and her heart pounded in her chest. This would only work if she could find peace within herself. She tried in vain to shut out his cries and the horrible smells, but it was too much—it wouldn’t work that way. She was too present, and the sensations were too strong. She had to focus inward… had to find something…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Her earliest memory of Impa playing a flute to calm her to bed. Her feelings of warmth and joy, nestled in Father’s arms as he read to her. Sage Amaurath’s pride when she shared her first discovery.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She lost herself in the memories, pulling them to the fore of her mind. She used them as a focus for her magic, radiating pulses of soothing energy. The man’s cries abated, and he fell still. Zelda set to work immediately. Motes of green sparked and swirled in her hands as she pressed them to his chest. Seconds passed, and the wounds began to knit together. Just as expected, he began to writhe and moan in anguish as the mended flesh pulled itself apart.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shhhh,” she whispered, alternating between mending and soothing pulses. “It will be okay. Listen to me. It will be okay.” She sung to him, pouring herself into the healing. He fell silent, and she continued her work. The holes and gashes in his chest contracted and expanded in tune with his heartbeat, as lines of green swirled and spiraled between them. Minutes passed, but with every beat the wounds knit closer and closer together, until at last he was whole again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda fell back, sobbing. Her awareness faded, and she was overcome by darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>She came to, finding herself in her own bed. It felt like much time had passed, but she had no idea how long she had been out. It hurt to breathe. It hurt to move. Her head was splitting, and her throat was parched. She tried to sit up, but was pushed firmly back down by the nurse tending to her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Easy. Easy, now,” the woman said gently. Zelda tried to relax. Her side <i>really</i> hurt. She found it difficult to focus. Sights and sounds bled together. The nurse wiped her face with a washcloth and held a flask to her mouth. Zelda drank deeply. The water was cool, and refreshing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Slowly. Easy does it. There’s no rush.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eased back, and fell into a fitful sleep.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>She woke again sometime later. Her headache wasn’t as bad, but her side was still every bit as tender. The nurse from before sat across from her, knitting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How… how long…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“About three days, dearie.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Three days?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse offered her a flask, which she gratefully accepted. Zelda sipped from it, and slowly the fog in her mind began to clear. “There was a battle,” she said, though she couldn’t remember much else. “Do you know what happened?“</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You cracked a few ribs, and you’re suffering from acute magical exhaustion,” the nurse said. “The worst of it’s passed, but your spirit hasn’t fully recovered. You’ll need to take it easy for a while—a month or so by my reckoning—unless you want to risk feedback and degradation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. She knew how bad exhaustion could be. Affinity acted like a fulcrum, allowing one to leverage their magic with greater force. However, with greater force came greater risk to one’s self—hence why she in particular often overdid it when she exerted herself. If she wasn’t careful with her magic now, she risked losing it forever.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But… She shook her head. That wasn’t what she wanted to know. “No, I mean… what happened at the battle? And before that, I was… at the gate?" She examined her hands. They did not glow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know for certain, dear," the nurse said. “I’m not the one to ask. To hear it told, you crashed down from the heavens, reborn as Hylia herself! They say you flew across the battlefield with the army at your back, raining down death and destruction upon the hordes until the goddess left you and you fell from the sky. Quite the fanciful tale, if you ask me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, that wasn’t exactly how it happened. Still, the words stirred her recollection, and she remembered slightly more than before. “Is it over, then?” Zelda asked. “Have we won?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse scoffed. “I suppose that depends on what you mean by ‘won.’ The hordes have fallen back and the city is no longer under siege, if that’s what you’re asking.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She didn’t like the sound of that. “Fi?” Zelda called out, looking around. “Fi, are you there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How are you feeling, dear?” the nurse asked, concern showing on her face. She put down her craft and knelt by Zelda’s side, holding a hand to her cheek. “You should get more rest if you can. It’ll do you good.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I’m fine,” Zelda said, waving her away. “Or I will be, I’m sure. Thank you.” She would rest later. Right now, she needed answers. With care, she eased up, resting against her pillows. “Ah, how terribly rude of me,” she said, smiling. “I never properly thanked you for your service. What was your name again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nilda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Nilda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww—it’s my pleasure to serve, Your Grace,” Nilda said with a smile. “I will be glad to see you on your way back to good health.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda furrowed her brow, putting affect into her voice. “Nilda, do you know where Impa is? Has she been by?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned. “What about Wymar—the Lord General?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nilda smiled, shaking her head. “I think it’s best if you got back to rest, dear. No visitors just yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt a pang of paranoia. What had transpired while she slept? Did Impa make it back safely? And there was no telling what the Council had gotten up to. She never had time to resolve the matter of succession.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nilda?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, dear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Regrettably, I do not have the patience for this at present. You will go now, and send for the Lord General. Do not speak another word to me unless you wish to be thrown out the window by my guard.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nilda gasped, taken aback. She stumbled, then turned from the room and fled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The poor woman. She didn’t deserve that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waited impatiently as several minutes passed. Her legs grew stiff. She tried curling them on the bed, but her side protested too much. At last, a knock sounded at the door and Wymar poked his head through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess?” he asked uncertainly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda beckoned him to enter. “Please, come in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m glad to see you’re awake,” he said. “How are you feeling?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nilda seems to think I’ll be just fine after some rest.” She waved a hand. “Listen, Wymar. I don’t have patience for small talk right now. Just tell me: how bad is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Straight to business, then,“ Wymar said with a grunt. He pulled up a chair from beside the hearth and sat, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Where to start. We broke the siege, but we’re looking at around four-hundred thousand deaths, all said. The eastern lands took the worst of it. We’ve been successful in preventing any incursions further west, but Hateno was completely destroyed and Castletown is in serious disrepair. We’ve only around twenty-thousand soldiers left in the northern contingent, and the countryside is overrun with smaller, leaderless bands.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s heart sank. It was every bit as bad as she had feared. Still, she needed to know. “My memory fails me,” she said. “The last thing I remember is fighting, and then healing a soldier at the northwest gate. What happened after that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar clasped his hands and tilted his head to the side. “At first—with <i>you</i> in command—they broke. It was a complete rout. We swept the field! It looked like a chapter taken straight out of a folktale.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And then Hylia’s boon faded?” Zelda suggested.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded grimly with a distant look in his eye. “I don’t understand it. If she had just held with us a little while longer…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She?” Zelda looked to him, askance. “Wymar, it was <i>me</i> with you the whole time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar narrowed his eyes. “Begging your pardon, Princess, but you were not yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… see,” Zelda said uncertainly. Now <i>that</i> unsettled her. What had happened, in the time she was unconscious?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Her magic—<i>your</i> magic—was a terror to behold," he said. ”You inspired fear in the enemy. But when you fell, many of them recovered. They rallied, and the ensuing fight was… costly. Ultimately, we won the day, but only just.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How many of them remain?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s hard to put an exact number on it,” Wymar said. “Somewhere between one and two-hundred thousand?” He rubbed his chin. “Likely on the lower end, unless there’s a larger group still out there somewhere. Apparently you managed to kill one of the Warlords, and that sent them into disarray.“</span>
<br><br>
<span>"Wait—<i>one</i> of the Warlords?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar muttered a curse. “Yes, a single Warlord. The reports indicate there to be another out there—possibly two.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By the Mother!” Zelda exclaimed. She couldn’t believe it. “How is that so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not a philosopher, nor a historian, Princess,” Wymar said, shaking his head. “I couldn’t say. There’s some good news, though. The southern forces have won out, and they still have about fifty-thousand in fighting shape. They’re working on pushing the remaining organized resistance back to Talus. With luck, they’ll buy us the time we need to recoup and muster more forces. As bad as it is, it could be much worse.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. She sat silently, letting it all settle in her mind. The weight of it all… she was so far out of her depth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She met Wymar’s eyes, and he looked away. She watched curiously as he shifted in his seat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wymar? What aren’t you saying?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>He drew in a sharp breath before crossing his arms. “I’m sorry—I hate to be the one to tell you. I suppose I’ll just say it then: Gaillard is dead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The news didn’t hit as hard as she imagined it should have. It was sad, though not heartbreaking. Still, the finality of it stung. Until now, she had held on to a measure of hope. What she lost now was only that hope. In truth, Father’s death happened five months ago, and she was well past mourning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry to hear that,” Zelda said softly. “How did it happen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There was an attack on his chambers at some point during the assault,” Wymar said. “A rogue Sheikah faction.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Vesyrn?!</i>” Zelda’s pulse sped up and she leaned forward. The sudden movement caused her side to flare up, and she winced from the pain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar stood to attend to her, but she waved him away. “No, I’m okay. Please, go on. Was it Vesyrn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded as he sat back down, mouth drawing to a line. “Yes, it was him. We’re still unsure of the extent of his treachery. The Sheikah are in disarray. Vian is dead. Allanah is missing—suspected dead. The rest—that we’ve been able to locate, at least—have been detained pending investigation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda clutched at her chest. “Impa? What about Impa? Is she with them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar grew stiff. He didn’t answer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said, trembling, fear rising. “Wymar, no. Please, no. Tell me she’s with them. At least tell me she hasn’t been found.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry, Princess. I know how close she was to you. It seems she died attempting to protect your father.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sunk into her bed as the world collapsed around her. From somewhere far away, the words came: “You can take solace in knowing that she died a hero.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Wymar,” Zelda heard her voice say, a million miles distant. “That is enough for now. Please, leave me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Somewhere else, in a world that wasn’t hers, a door closed shut.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda stood before the gathered masses in the castle’s Sanctum, dressed in regal splendor. The High Bishop was giving a speech—something about the importance of faith and unity in these dark and trying times. Zelda couldn’t follow it. Her thoughts kept drifting back to that day. It was scarcely a week past, yet it felt like an eternity. There she stood, not twenty paces hence, cowering before assassins and praying to Hylia for salvation. Of course, all traces of what had transpired were long gone. Scrubbed clean. Even the window was bricked up and covered with a thin facade. A fitting analogy, she supposed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked to her right, to the clustered soldiers in formal dress. And to the man who stood at their fore.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why did it have to be this way?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sure, he was a hero. Sure, he saved thousands of lives. But she wasn’t angry with <i>him</i>. She respected him. The whole realm owed him a debt of gratitude. Zelda would give so much for more to have his valor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was just—did his life <i>really matter</i> all that much in the grand scheme of things? She had all the power of a goddess coursing through her veins. She could have saved Father. She could have saved <i>Impa</i>, had she known she was in danger. She might have even stopped Vesyrn, recovered the fragments of Wisdom, and still had time to lead the armies afterward. Instead, Hylia had sent her after this man. So much time wasted, saving the life of a poor fool who charged headlong into certain death knowing he wouldn’t make it back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps in time the pain and the anger would fade. But now was not that day. If she ever met the Mother again, they would have <i>words</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“From Hylia, Holy Mother Above, we ask her blessing,” the High Bishop had concluded his speech, and the High Priestess was now saying her prayer. “From Nayru, we ask her wisdom to guide us. From Din, we ask her power to defend our realm. And from Farore, we ask her courage to see us through the darkness.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda knelt, and the High Priestess placed a crown upon her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Rise, with the blessings of the Goddesses! All hail, Queen Zelda Numenia Proventia Hyrule!"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hail, Queen Zelda!” voices echoed back in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“All hail, the Queen of Hyrule!” the Priestess exalted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hail, Queen of Hyrule!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stepped forward, receiving a golden scepter from the High Bishop. The two of them stepped back to stand at either side, and Zelda recited the trite speech given to her by the Council.</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span>After the ceremonies, Zelda retreated to her study. She had hoped to find something to distract her from the gravity and import she faced at every turn—even for just a moment—but it was no use. Her studies didn’t hold the same color they once did and her mind kept wandering to other matters. Perhaps when this was all over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had so much to think about. Her kingdom teetered on the brink of ruin, and so many had died. Leaderless bands of Blin marauded across the countryside, and the armies had yet to reclaim Talus. And it baffled her that there were multiple Warlords behind the Blight to begin with, when their kind had never coordinated like this before. What had changed? Who was "the Lynx" that the messenger mentioned? Where did Vesyrn go with her stolen fragments of Wisdom, and who had them now? Who was this "Exiled King" that sent the assassins after her?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda thought back to her visions. The mountain and earthquakes obviously referred to the Blight. The Zora said they would handle the matter regarding the River Hylia running backward, but she never got a chance to follow up on that. She still intended to. And what of the great shadow moving over the desert and across the sea? Had that event already happened, or was it still to come?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She knew she could leave the fighting wholly to the Lord General, if necessary. And likewise, the Council could handle the recovery efforts without her in the way to muck things up. Still, Zelda wondered what her role should be. She always wanted to be a strong ruler, like Father. She was Queen now, and she felt like it was her duty to take a proactive role in seeing her kingdom through this darkness and into the future. Only, there was so much to do, and so many questions left unanswered. Where even to begin?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked around at her empty study, pondering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi? Are you there?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ethereal specter had not come to her again since that day. Zelda wondered if she would ever see her again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Three knocks sounded at the door to the hallway below, echoing softly against the walls. Zelda felt a sense of deja vu, followed by a stab of pain and longing when she looked for Anli and did not see her handmaiden. She had not heard from the girl since leaving for the expedition, what felt like a lifetime ago now. Zelda hoped she was okay.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He’s here, Your Grace,” a guardsman announced.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you. Send him in,” she called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda placed a marker in her book and rose, making her way down the stairs. She poured herself a cup of wine at the table below, and another for her guest. Speaking of…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, Arlinkar,” she said, smiling and offering him a hand. “I’m so glad to finally meet you under better circumstances.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man sauntered up to her uneasily, casting furtive glances in every direction. He walked with a cane, and his chest was heavily bandaged. Even with magic, it would be several days before he was fully healed. She would have to see what she could do to make him more comfortable.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took her hand and bowed his head. “It’s, uh, it’s just ‘Link,’ actually. If you don’t mind. Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, then,” Zelda said, gesturing to the table. “Please, have a seat. We have so much to discuss.”</span>
