<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">(Updated 35th of First Brisk, 547 CE)</div>
<br>
<span>While the monarch is the ultimate authority in all matters, the Council exists to advise the monarch and to ensure that the concerns of the Noble Houses and of the common people are represented. The authority of the monarch is delegated as such:</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Queen’s Law has the duty of maintaining the written law; determining when a crime has been committed, who is responsible, and to what degree; and adjudicating disagreements between private citizens. They have the power to delegate any and all of these responsibilities to magistrates throughout the kingdom, who ultimately answer to the Queen’s Law. They may also administer court in the absence of the monarch. The position is currently held by Chancellor Nyllara Zan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Queen’s Justice has the duty of enforcing the law and upholding public order; prosecuting potential criminals and arguing their guilt before the law; and determining the punishments for breaking the law. They delegate this power to various administrative groups throughout the kingdom, and may also administer court in the absence of the monarch. The position is currently held by Chancellor Adresin Lotan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lord General is the penultimate authority over the military. They administer the outposts, command the armed forces, and oversee logistics. Their role on the council is to request and provision goods and services for military use, and to ensure the monarch and the council members are aware of military concerns. The position is currently held by Wymar Letholdus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The House of Nobles is comprised of one representative from each Noble House, of which there are twenty. Each representative may attend council meetings and represent their house’s interests before the crown, but is not required to attend. Each year, they choose among them a single Head who attends all meetings year-round. The position is currently held by Countess Lensa Oda.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The House of Commons is comprised of twelve influential citizens chosen by the common people to represent them. Every two years, those seeking such a position may petition the Queen’s Law for candidacy. Twelve of the candidates are then chosen by moot, where interested citizens of Castletown gather and cheer for their chosen. Winners are adjudicated by the Queen’s Justice. The Head of the House of Commons is charged with overseeing tax collection and administering financial concerns within the kingdom. This position is currently held by Prime Counselor Taetus.</span>

<span><i><u>1st of Last Brisk, 548 CE:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>And so begins a new year. Let us hope our good fortune holds, and that the Blight is ended swiftly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much to do. Just taking a moment to jot down my thoughts…</span>
<br><br>
<span>During the attack, Arlinkar suffered a host of critical, life-threatening wounds, including organ damage and several shattered bones. I healed the worst of it and prevented him from dying (and also cured his bloodrage—praise be unto the Goddesses), but he still had to spend several days bedridden as the healing magics took effect. It was just the day before my coronation that he was able to walk around unaided with a cane. Due to the frankly insane level of magic I used in healing him in my empowered state, his recovery rate has been spectacular. He’s expected to be in fighting shape in a little over a week. Well—as long as he eats enough to keep up his strength and doesn’t strain himself too much. I want to get him to work as soon as possible, but we need to be careful not to break the healing effect. I don’t know how well he’s holding up. I haven’t asked. He’s hard to read.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wounds I suffered from the battle were comparatively minor (and have already healed), but I suffered particularly severe magical exhaustion. I’m past the worst of it, and while I could theoretically still use magic while recovering, even approaching my limit again may severely dampen my affinity in the long run. Given my track record and poor control, I’d rather not risk it risk it. My recovery is expected to last another three weeks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>After the assassination attempt, I’ve massively increased castle security, preventing anyone not here on official business from entering or leaving except under armed guard. This has been tricky, as the number of petitioners has (predictably) increased dramatically in recent days. I’ve seen to it that the watchtowers are manned at all hours of the day, and that all entrances are under constant surveillance with routine patrols and constant communication. Hopefully this will be enough to deter additional attacks until we can smoke out any additional enemy agents.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everything is on fire, and I have no idea what to do about it. It almost goes without saying, but the loss of Hateno, the ongoing war effort, and the sheer death toll (estimated at 30% of the total population) is a massive blow to infrastructure. Everything south of the floodplains and east of the river has been given up for lost, at least until the Blight comes to an end. If it weren’t the case that each region is mostly self-sufficient, this would be entirely insurmountable. As it stands, we’re going to have a very hard time of it holding things together in the coming months.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The influx of refugees from the eastern lands and the floodplains are putting a heavy strain on Castletown in particular and the northern province in general. Noble Houses have been granted significant tax breaks and issued bonds for their assistance in housing and feeding refugees. They’re still strained and at their limit. There’s scarcely enough food to go around, and it’s heavily rationed. This arrangement is not sustainable, as supplies are limited and food production is minimal, it being the middle of Brisk. Something has to be done before supplies run out, lest the city face revolt and open rebellion. My counselors tell me the timeline on this is currently around 3-4 months.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The crime rate is up dramatically, despite enforcement crackdown—the vast majority of which being economically motivated. Assault and petty theft is the worst of it. The streets are decidedly not safe due to the constant threat of assault and other violent crime. Those who can defend themselves or afford to pay for armed guard are just fine, but everyone else…</span>
<br><br>
<span>There were isolated incidents of rioting and pillaging in the days immediately following the attack, but many of the offenders were rounded up and publicly executed at Wymar’s command. Grim and unfortunate, but his action thus far served as a clear message and effective deterrent. Hopefully that will remain the case when he leaves for the front.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Banditry is also on the rise outside the city. Leaderless bands of Blin are still ravaging the countryside, adding to the ever-present threat of fiend encroachment. As a consequence, caravan traffic has taken a hit and it has become that much more expensive to travel and transport goods. Nominally, forces have been dispatched to counter this, but I fear it won’t be enough. Still, I don’t have any ideas, and until Talus has been reclaimed and the hordes repelled, the main concern right now is the war effort. Larger towns will likely be able to hold out, but smaller villages will continue to sustain losses and the death toll will continue to rise until the bands have been eliminated. Undoubtedly, this will have cascading effects on long-term production and stability.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On the matters of reconstruction and the war effort, I have entirely flubbed on this and left it to the Council and Wymar respectively. They seem to be doing a good enough job without me in the way to muck things up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I know I should probably make some public appearances, but fear of assassins has kept me from doing so. All the more to hope for Link’s speedy recovery. I’m considering a couple public speeches and a few private meetings with the nobility (in the safety of the castle, of course)… but again, I know much more needs to be done on this front.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A fair number among the populace seem to believe I am capable of much more than I actually am, and that I am simply indifferent to their plight. I’m not sure how much I should say about my limitations, and I’d really rather not…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda buried her face in her hands, slouching back at her desk. Even with what little peace and solitude she managed to find as of late, she couldn’t escape the constant work and stress. She had been fighting with herself constantly. Every idea she had, she considered and reconsidered ten times over. She was terrified of doing the wrong thing, or of not doing the right thing, or goddess-forbid interfering with whatever Hylias’s plans might have been and causing even more problems.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She wasn’t even sure if it was safe to write as much in her own diary.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On some level, she knew it was silly. How could she be so vain as to believe herself capable of derailing plans set in motion by <i>the Holy Mother herself</i>? Did Hylia not trust her enough as to appoint her as her personal champion? Logically, Zelda knew that doing anything was better than doing nothing. Yet somehow, that made it even worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She knew she couldn’t keep this up for much longer. Too much was expected of her. Too much was riding on <i>her</i>. She had to act.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She rubbed her face, pulling the next parchment from the seemingly endless pile. Reports of a rogue squadron of mages that had fled during the initial assault on the city. For those such as they—blessed by the Goddesses themselves—to abandon their duty was seen as both treason and heresy. Normally the task of hunting them down fell to the Sheikah. But with the Sheikah in their current state…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda thought back to Wymar’s request—and she had approved it without thinking! How daft was she?! They couldn’t afford to waste the Sheikah on the front lines like that! There was too much to be done!</span>
<br><br>
<span>She hoped it wasn’t too late. She set the parchment aside, resolving to speak with Wymar again at the first opportunity.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Deep breath.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, how she wished she had someone to confide in. Someone she could rely on. Anyone. Fi was proving to be less than useless more often than not. Anli was missing. And Impa…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hoped Link might eventually fill that role in some capacity. He could never take <i>her</i> place… but with someone as competent as him watching her back, at least she could feel safe leaving the castle. Even so, it would be a few more days before he was fully recovered, and he wasn’t exactly in the best place himself right now, either.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was Wymar. He was Zelda’s own family, and she trusted him with her life. He was always open and honest with her, and she had so much respect for him. However, he had just as much to worry about as she did with the war effort, if not moreso. She couldn’t justify dumping more on him now, not unless she had no other options.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She supposed Lensa had always been a positive force in her life, for better or worse. Lensa had been Zelda’s tutor since she was a young girl, and even now acted as a de-facto aide and guide in matters of high socity. <i>The poor woman</i>, Zelda thought. <i>Father never knew what to do with me, and so had no choice but to pawn me off on her.</i> She had always been stern and… well, unforgiving. But Zelda trusted her. Perhaps she would have some insight as to how she should proceed in her new role?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grimaced. Then there was <i>Counselor Taetus</i>. For everything that wretch of a man was, even she had to admit that he was good at his job. There was a reason Father had respected him, after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Perhaps…</span>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda knocked at the door to Link’s quarters. A moment later, the door swung open.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Link said, rubbing his eyes. “Welcome, Your… uh, Zelda. Please, come in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not a bad time, is it? I can come back later.” Zelda cocked her head, offering a conciliatory smile. She had thought for certain he would be up at this hour. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it’s alright,” he said, retreating to take a seat on his bed. She entered behind him and pulled the door shut.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waited patiently, but he was not forthcoming. She was beginning to notice a pattern with this one. She took the liberty of finding her own seat at the small desk to the side of the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She cleared her throat. “So. How are you holding up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m fine,” Link said. Completely inscrutable, as ever.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a breath, tapping her fingers at the side of her leg. He’d have to be trying to make this more awkward. “You know, I understand it’s been rough the past few days,” she said. “So much has happened… so much to process…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…and I can only guess what you’ve been going through…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…what you’re feeling…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stiffened up. What <i>was</i> he feeling?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suppose what I mean to say is, I’m worried about your mental state, Link. It’s not healthy to keep everything bottled up. Maybe you should find someone to talk to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” he said, slouching. “Alright. Thank you. I will.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised an eyebrow. He met her eyes and looked away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You don’t have to lie to me. It’s alright. I’m not expecting anything from you. I’m just worried, is all. I think you should talk with someone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Begging your pardon,” he said, “But I don’t exactly have anyone to talk to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Zelda said, suddenly wanting to vanish. How thoughtless of her. “Yeah, I can relate to that,” she said. “At least, you know… since…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, damnation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen, Link. I’m planning to meet with the High Priestess soon. I can arrange a meeting for you as well, after I’ve had a chance to meet with her and discuss what happened. I know you probably don’t want to hear it, but it might actually help. I’ve always found her to be rather insightful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sighed, falling back on his bed. “I appreciate the offer, Zelda. I really do. It’s just—I mean, I guess it wouldn’t hurt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda clasped her hands together and—oh, he accepted? “Oh. Okay. Great!” she said, feeling a touch relieved.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link made no reply, except to continue staring up at the ceiling.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Alright</i>, then. That was enough awkwardness for one day. Zelda stood, shaking her head. She had more than enough—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think Fi can compel creatures like wolfos and kargaroks?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, what?” Zelda said, taken by surprise. She eyed him quizzically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know, have them attack people? Because that sounds like it would be pretty useful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know,” Zelda said. Come to think of it, that did sound rather useful. “I’ll be sure to ask her later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m leaving now,” Zelda said, with all the grace of a three-legged kodongo.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. Thanks for coming by.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Oh, you don’t say!” Zelda said, doing her best to feign interest as she stabbed at her food. She had no idea what was being discussed at this point, and she couldn’t be bothered to care. As long as she kept up appearances, the cuccos were happy to cluck away. Lensa caught her eye from across the table. Zelda turned her attention, trying not to give too much away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why <i>wouldn’t</i> Lensa take the dinner invitation as another opportunity to refine Zelda’s social graces? She really wasn’t expecting the full complement, nor did she particularly want to be here, but she also couldn’t turn them away once they arrived. How much longer would she have to endure this torment?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The table fell silent, all eyes on her. Mother’s mercy—someone had asked her a question, hadn’t they?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled, wiping at her mouth with a napkin. “I’m so sorry, could you speak up? I didn’t quite catch that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The younger girls giggled amongst themselves. Lensa regarded her coolly. Across the table to Zelda’s left, Efla spoke up. Or was it Mave?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, Your Grace. You needn’t be shy! Especially at your age. It’s only <i>natural</i>.” With a wink, the older woman nudged the younger girl to her right to another round of giggling laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pardon?” Zelda asked, frustration growing. She wasn’t sure how much more of this she could handle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Arlinkar,</i> dear,” Efla-slash-Mave said. “The Hero of Castletown! Nipa said she heard that you two were… <i>you know</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is it true, Your Grace?” / "Is it?” / “Tell us!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All color drained from Zelda’s face. Her mouth refused to work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe that is enough for now,” Lensa said, standing. “Begging your pardon, Your Grace. The girls get carried away sometimes.” She gave the older woman a glare.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww, but we were just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—That’s enough, Nipa,” Efla (Mave?) said, rolling her eyes and jabbing a finger at the younger girl. “Listen to your mother.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, ma’am,” Nipa said, feigning a frown. “Sorry, Mother.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll get them out of your hair, sweetie,” the older woman said smugly. “Efla, do you mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not at all,” definitely-Efla said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa only smiled and bowed her head. “Thank you, Mother.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Come along now,” Mave said. “The queen and your mother have important business to discuss!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sat deathly still, waiting for the procession to file out of the hall. The three girls and the two older women left, leaving her alone with Lensa and Sera—the woman who was to be her new handmaiden.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Lensa asked with a smirk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Zelda said, aghast. “It’s not… I’m not… <i>he’s</i> not…” She set her napkin down over her plate, taking a breath. “No. Just—no.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A shame. He would make a fine consort,” Lensa said with a tisk. “You do know you’ll have to bear children eventually? Or did you learn nothing from the succession crisis?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gah!” Zelda buried her face in her arms. This was <i>not</i> the conversation she wanted to be having right now! The kingdom was on the brink of ruin and all they could think about was who had access to her loins? “Lensa, I appreciate—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Spare me the excuses,” she said. “We all have to do our duty sooner or later. Sera can help. I know you’d prefer that anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s head shot up. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing! She gaped, slack-jawed, looking briefly to the other girl whose face had to be as red as hers. “Lensa! That’s enough! I’ll hear no more of this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine, fine,” she said dismissively, waving a hand. “We’ll table the matter for now. Like everything else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you serious right now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh? My apologies. Did the Princess finally decide to do something?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am your <i>queen</i>!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Are you?!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda fell back, speechless.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I thought not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lensa, please… it’s just… it’s so hard… I never thought I’d have to…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Spare me the tears, Princess. We don’t have time for your childishness.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was right—damnation, but she was. Zelda wiped her eyes and sat up. “I know," she said. “I know. That’s actually why I asked you here in the first place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa sat forward now, her interest piqued. “Oh? Do tell.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a moment to compose herself. “I had meant to ask after your advice,” she said. “I believe it would all go much smoother if I just had… more people around me that I trusted. To advise me on decisions, and to execute my will when the decisions are made.” She felt foolish the moment the words left her mouth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dearie, look at me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s precisely what I’ve been trying to tell you this whole time. Or haven’t you been listening? The Council is <i>exactly that</i>. You need not fear us. You need not try and hide your ineptitude, if such were even possible. We expect you to flail about uselessly, at least at first. That’s <i>why</i> there’s a Council in the first place. Or did you think you were the first royal to sit the throne with no business being there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yet again, Zelda found herself at a loss for words. That made far too much sense. Was the world allowed to make that much sense? She was pretty sure it wasn’t. That had to violate some fundamental law of nature.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To your credit, you recognize your own incompetence, and that matters a great deal. But you want my advice? I’ve already given it. <i>Stability</i> is the primary function of the monarchy, and stability is least at risk when there is a clear and unambiguous line of succession. The rest is just window dressing and philosophical nuance. Will you ever be a competent ruler? Only the Goddesses know. Most aren’t; your father was an exception. But so long as you trust in your council and put your kingdom first, we <i>will</i> prevail. As we always have.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Thank you, Lensa.” Zelda had no idea what else to say. She was decidedly <i>not</i> ready to deal with any of this right now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is my pleasure to serve, Your Grace,” Lensa said, bowing her head. She paused for a moment, looking thoughtful. “And on a more immediate note, I advise you to not allow your subjects to question your authority. You must act with poise, grace, and authority at all times. The Council exists to advise you and assist you in governing the kingdom, but ultimately cannot dispute you or overrule you when you’ve come to a decision.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s eyes narrowed. “But that doesn’t make sense. You just said—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa smiled. “Yes, you’ve always been a sharp one. You can figure it out. Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh. It was clear, once she viewed it from the right angle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It goes back to stability, right? Often, decisiveness matters more than the nuance between two good options. And if I’m being presented with options the Council can’t resolve, it’s usually going to be better to pick among them decisively than to do nothing."</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Got it in one," Lensa said, beaming. “There may be hope for you yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Wymar?” Zelda called down the hall. “A moment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man waved away an aide and strode up to meet her, nodding respectfully. “Your Grace. Is something the matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I just wanted to discuss deployment of the Sheikah with you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar frowned. “Can’t it wait until the meeting? It’s less than an hour away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s actually what I wanted to discuss with you,” Zelda said. “Ahead of time. As a courtesy.” She gestured to an empty room across the hall. “Shall we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly," he said, curtly. “After you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda entered, and Wymar closed the door behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took in a breath. She could do this. “Listen. I don’t want to deploy the Sheikah on the front lines.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar grunted, his lips curling up in annoyance. “With respect, Your Grace. It’s not like I’m going to throw them around like fodder. I only mean to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda drew tall, doing her best to channel Lensa. Father, even. “That is <i>enough</i> Wymar. I’ve heard your case, and I’ve decided against it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar’s expression shifted several times, faster than she could follow. Finally he settled on a firm scowl befitting a general. He stood at arms and saluted, balled fist over his chest. “As you command, Your Grace! Was there anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well. That was easier than she—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress,” Fi’s voice echoed in her mind. “I am detecting an abnormally strong emotional response from Wymar. Despite his stoic demeanor, I believe he is harboring intense anger.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm. Wymar?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Zelda winced. By the Mother, what was she doing? This was the exact opposite of Lensa’s advice. “I didn’t mean to offend you. I just… I’ve been trying so hard to fill the space Father left behind. The last thing I want is to damage our relationship, but I can’t deal with <i>even you</i> questioning my authority." She paused, searching for the right words. “I’m willing to listen to your advice and hear you out, but ultimately I can’t allow you to dispute me or overrule me when I’ve come to a decision.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar relaxed with a chuckle. He crossed his arms. “Heh. I see you’ve been taking advice from Lensa.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And now for the third time today, Zelda felt like she could drop dead from sheer embarrassment. <i>Why, why, why…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s nothing,” he said, waving a hand. “Seriously, don’t worry about it. I trust you have a plan?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re too forgiving, Wymar,” she managed to say. If people kept being so sensible, she was sure to wake up at any moment. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda? We’re family, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She froze, taken off-guard. She considered, then nodded. Slowly. “Yes. Of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then I have your back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… thank you,” Zelda said, choking up a little. She turned to wipe her eyes. That was unexpected; Wymar had never been the sentimental type. “I can’t tell you how much that means to me. I’m glad to know I have someone I can count on.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Always,” he said with a smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda laughed. What was she ever worried about?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar cleared his throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Right, plan. “So, I was thinking. We could send the Sheikah out to the countryside to combat banditry and work against the roving Blin. There’s a rogue squadron of mages out west that needs dealing with as well. I’m not a strategist by any means, but it seems painfully obvious to me that it would be a far more effective use of their skills. Small, evasive, high-value targets? They can actually make a large impact here. And despite your assertions to the contrary, I have trouble believing thirty-eight individuals—however talented—would make a noticeable dent in the hordes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He grunted at that. “You’re underestimating the effect that fielding elite troops has on morale. Soldiers fight more fiercely and with more confidence when the monsters are on <i>their</i> side.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised her palms. “Hey. If you don’t believe it’s workable, I’ll—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He held up a hand. “I’m not saying that. You’re right on one count. It <i>would</i> be more effective, and we can’t spare anyone else for the task right now. It makes sense, and was actually the first thing I considered. But I need not remind you that their loyalty can’t be confirmed right now. Who could we possibly trust to that task? The last thing we need is traitors in our midst.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated. “About that. I was planning to interrogate them personally, actually.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Wymar said, bluntly. “No—I don’t give a damn if you’re the Queen or Hylia herself. I’m not letting you near any of them. You can’t possibly believe you’ll fare better than my senior staff.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a moment to compose her words carefully. “I see your point, but I wouldn’t suggest this if I wasn’t confident. I can’t tell you everything right now, but suffice it to say that there are… a few abilities available to me since Hylia’s empowerment. I’m still learning how to use them though, and it’s best if no one else knows about this right now. At least, until I can speak with High Priestess Vestele. Can I trust you to keep this in confidence?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Of course. Go on—I’m listening.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid that’s all I can say right now. You’ll just have to trust me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar regarded her sternly. Zelda did her best to show all the confidence she wasn’t feeling—tried not to shy away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright," he said at last. “I’ll accept that on faith for now. We’ll have to do this soon, though. I’m leaving in two days for the front.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Absolutely,” Zelda said. “And if the interrogation doesn’t work out like I hope, then we’ll stick with your original plan. How does that sound?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He smiled at that. “Sounds like a plan, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“I’ve made my decision,” Zelda said, addressing the nine members of the Council gathered in the small chamber. “I won’t be leaving for Kakariko. And regarding the Sheikah, we will not be deploying them to the front lines. Rather, we’ll be sending them against the roving Blin bands, and other high priority targets. If all goes according to plan, that is.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t seem wise, Your Grace,” Chancellor Nyllara said. “I can’t imagine—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I’ve spoken beforehand with our Queen on the matter,” Wymar said, interrupting. “And I am confident enough to proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two of them exchanged glances.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah,” Nyllara said, taken aback. “I didn’t realize. Forgive me, Your Grace; I was wrong to speak out of turn.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded to the Chancellor, smiling to herself. “Which brings me to the next item. I have decided to accept the Lynx’s offer.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was met with only stunned silence. Even Wymar seemed surprised. Perhaps she should have eased into that one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>While her kingdom had held a tenuous but relatively peaceful relationship with the Gerudo people over the ages, that relationship had deteriorated in more recent times. Several years ago, raiding parties begun sacking smaller villages in the south, evading patrols by making their pass through the mountains. As far as anyone could tell, the groups were uncoordinated, and had no connection to any governing body within what was once a unified nation. Various attempts were made to make demands of Gerudo leadership to reign in the renegades, but to no avail. Few messengers ever returned. As the raids became more frequent and emboldened, Last Bastion constructed makeshift prison camps to hold the captives. That only held for so long, however. In desperation, Father had changed military policy to engage any Gerudo parties on sight and to take no prisoners. That put a halt to the raids, but also ended what trade and peaceful relations remained.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda could only imagine what their internal politics looked like. She also had the thought that perhaps these “Sunseekers” might even be the group that was working with Vesyrn—according to Fi’s account of Impa’s conversation with Vian. Wouldn’t that be something?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I realize this may sound brash, or even foolish,” Zelda said. “But hear me out. I harbor no illusions that their offer of aid is an act of altruism and kindness. But by the same token, I believe it’s quite likely that this group is acting out of political desperation. And if that is so, then it means we can exploit their position just as surely as they hope to exploit ours. I know who we’re dealing with, and we’ll need to tread carefully. But I am of the opinion it would be most unwise to turn down any legitimate offers of aid given the current state of the kingdom—no matter how far-fetched they may seem at first. At the very least, it will not cost us much to get additional information. A single rider to escort an envoy to Last Bastion, and from there we can continue conversation via scry towers. Depending on how that unfolds, we can make the determination of how or even if we should proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Murmurs and whispers broke out across the chamber. Zelda held her breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was Lensa who finally spoke up. “Sounds sensible enough to me, Your Grace. What message should I send?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes!</i> No one was yelling, and she hadn’t yet melted into a pile of embarrassment and inadequacy. She had to keep herself calm, though; she could celebrate later. She took a moment to deliberate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Address it directly to ‘the Lynx’,” Zelda said. “‘I, Zelda, Queen of Hyrule, thank you for your offer. We will gladly hear you out. Come yourself, or send an envoy to Last Bastion. We will provide you with quarter and lodging while we arrange a meeting. I look forward to further discussion, and hope our peoples may aid one another in these dark and trying times.’ How’s that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Flowery, and somewhat unwieldy. But I can work with it.” Lensa finished scribbling her note before looking up. She winked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Countess,” Zelda said. “Moving on. Counselor Taetus?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus stepped forward, clearing his throat. “Yes, Your Grace?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda met his eyes and let the silence drag on for several moments longer than she should have. He shuffled in place, looking ill at ease. She was enjoying this too much.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Our people are threatened by famine and starvation; it is without a doubt the most urgent issue facing the kingdom, save for the war effort itself. Counselor: in my estimation, you’ve shown both initiative and competency in forestalling the crisis in Castletown, and are undoubtedly the most qualified man for the job. As such, I hereby charge you <i>personally</i> with overseeing the matter of food shortage throughout the whole of the kingdom. You have the full authority of the Crown to use any and all available resources, as it pertains to your charge.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus stood in a shocked stupor. He glanced around the room, to Nyllara, Wymar, and the other counselors. No one said a word.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Forgive me, Your Grace, but I was not expecting this,” he said finally. …And there was that infuriating grin of his. “You honor me beyond words. Thank you. I will see it done.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“As you likely know, there were sixty-five Sheikah at large before the attack,” Wymar said. Zelda walked with him down a corridor of the barracks where they were being held. “Since then, nine have been confirmed dead, eighteen are unaccounted for, and thirty-eight are being detained here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, following along. She had read the reports, but wasn’t sure of the exact numbers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’ve separated them into three groups based on who they reported to. Right now, we’re operating under the assumption that most or all of the ones who reported directly to Vian or Allanah are safe. Thirteen in total. But that’s far from certain—you never know how many levels they might be playing at. That group may well harbor a traitor or two. And seeing as most of the missing agents reported directly to Vesyrn, naturally the ones left are under the greatest suspicion. Seven in total. I doubt they’re all disloyal, but I’d also be surprised if they didn’t leave any rats behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unfortunately, the bulk of them we can’t separate—that’s eighteen remaining. For that group, it’s either unknown or undocumented who they reported to, or they reported directly to someone outside of Sheikah command structure. I’m not sure what to make of them, to be honest. Most of them are likely loyal, but there’s almost certainly a few traitors among them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They came to a halt at the top of a flight of stairs just as he finished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So,” Wymar said, turning to face her. “How do you want to go about this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda wasn’t all that certain, if she were being honest. She hadn’t given it much thought, aside from confirming with Fi that she would be able to offer assistance. “I suppose it would be a good idea to interrogate them one at a time? They should probably be restrained and siphoned of magic prior to interrogation. I’d feel safest with armed—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar held up a hand, shaking his head. “You misunderstand, Your Grace. I’ll handle the security. I just needed to know how you wanted to approach the interrogations. One at a time, then. Makes sense. Anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right, of course,” Zelda said, blushing. “And no, just a few minutes alone with each of them to ask questions should be enough.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar nodded, gesturing down the stairs. “After you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress,</i> came Fi’s voice. <i>I recommend a more nuanced approach to better ensure variable isolation.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually!” Zelda said, “I just thought of something. Would you give me a moment to work out the details?”</span>
<br><br>
