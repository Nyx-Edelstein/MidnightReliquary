<span>Izu stood near the hearth at the central guard tower, whittling at a wooden figurine and waiting for intelligence reports: ready to go at a moment’s notice. He and his team had been at the tower since the impromptu meeting a couple hours prior. Depending on the reports (or lack thereof) they could be heading anywhere, so it was prudent to keep to a central location for now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t the best craftsman, but he wasn’t the worst either. He finished the second of two deep V-cuts, and held the figurine at arm’s length. Not bad. He worked his knife methodically back and forth against the rough edges, smoothing them out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He knew he was getting weird looks, but he chose to ignore them, opting instead to continue his work in silence. Eventually someone asked, though. They always did.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Excuse me, Champion Izu, sir?” a young man in Talus colors said. “What’s that you’re working on?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Remlit,” Izu replied, passing the figure over for the man to inspect it. He took it, looked it over for a few seconds, then passed it back with a nod. “Had one as a family pet, years back,” Izu continued. “My niece loved it—treated it like part of the family.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>What he didn’t say was that he used to call his niece his “little remlit.” He didn’t have to, though. The man seemed to understand, bowing quietly and leaving Izu to his work. No one else bothered him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Senni, his niece, wasn’t his own of course, but he treated her like it all the same. That wonderful, lovely young woman was his ray of sunshine in times as dark as these; his guiding star whenever he felt lost. Izu’s brother, Karvik, had died fifteen years ago, and Senni and her mother Orsella came to live with Izu and his wife, Meril. They all now stayed with Izu’s uncle and cousins back at their family estate in Hillford—the better part of a day’s ride northwest of Kakariko.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu thanked the Goddesses every day for leaving that area of the country largely untouched by the Blight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another hour passed as he put the finishing touches on the piece and then carved his initials into the base. It wasn’t perfect, but it would do. He called for ink and paper and someone brought it to him right away. He penned out a brief note to his wife asking her to give the carving to Senni, then added the paper to his existing envelope.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t glory or heroism or honor or duty that motivated Izu. Not at the heart of it. Those were worthy ideals, sure, but he was a much simpler man than that. He merely wanted to keep his kingdom safe, and to protect the Sennis of the world. That was his calling—a purpose unquestionably worth dying for.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu glanced around the large room where he, his team, and two dozen other soldiers waited, catching bits and pieces of conversation here and there. It was nearing midnight, and finding the Warlord was proving to be more difficult than they had hoped. It had been almost three hours now since the decision had been made to go with Plan A, and still no target.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s assessment was… optimistic. To hear her tell it—what with all the tricks they had up their sleeves and Fi’s assistance besides—Izu and his team would waltz in, do away with the Warlord, and be back at Castletown in time for morning tea. He didn’t share the entirety of her assessment, but he had to acknowledge it was a solid plan. If it worked, it would be the best outcome for the kingdom by far. The Lord General agreed, and so it was decided—four to twenty-eight soldiers of the realm dead, but for the blade that killed them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The picks for the infiltration team were Gazra, Jedal, and Kellin. Red and Green Sheikah, and a Blue Seeker respectively. It was a somewhat odd decision to choose a Seeker for this mission, but not only had Kellin come highly recommended by Laylith (who, other concerns aside, would otherwise be the obvious first choice in terms of raw ability), Izu had personally seen Kellin in action. She might not have had the formal training of a Sheikah, but she was every bit as talented, with the craftiness, cunning, and ferocity to match. Kellin was a no-nonsense woman with a commanding presence, who took insult from no one. Izu respected that. What’s more, a long career in tracking down rogue mages meant she was well suited for a stealth mission. All around, a solid choice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra? There was hands-down no other competition. That man was the living, breathing definition of “battle-hardened warrior.” Tall, bulky, and gruff, with the scars to prove his valor. Gazra had a powerful transformation into the form of a great horned beast—like a mighty oxgoat in Hylian form. Izu had personally seen the man rip out a Moblin’s spine with his bare hands, and that was back <i>before</i> the first siege. Since then, he had been out on the front lines with the Lord General for months. Word had it that he felt betrayed when his loyalty was questioned in the wake of Vesyrn’s apparent defection, and he had spent every moment of the intervening time proving his devotion to everyone in the kingdom. Izu wasn’t sure what to make of that, but if Blin body count could serve as a stand-in measure for loyalty, Gazra was the most loyal man in the kingdom by a factor of three. Regardless of his motivations, Izu was very glad for this monster to be fighting on his side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As for Jedal… well. The choice of who to fill the Green slot on the team was difficult. They had lost many of their best due to circumstance, disloyalty, and death. Good green mages were hard to find, hard to train, and even harder to keep alive. They were demanded everywhere due to their Luck and Healing, and “everywhere” often included the front lines.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal was in the running with two other skilled Greens who had volunteered—all of whom Izu was assured would be good picks. Jedal, in true Green fashion, suggested Izu should pick among them according to a fair dice roll. After all, what better test of a Green mage could there be? Everyone had a good laugh at that, and Izu chose the man on the spot. He would never leave anything to chance—not when the fate of the kingdom rested in the balance, anyway. But even if Izu didn’t put much stock in the non-magical variety of luck, Jedal seemed like exactly the kind of Green mage you wanted on your side, if the recovered manuscripts were to be believed. Someone who felt comfortable leaning into their magic, while still being grounded enough that you could trust them with your life.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal chose that moment to approach Izu and opened his mouth to speak, but was interrupted when the doors were flung open by a messenger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan! The foreign woman—she found the Warlord’s camp!” the messenger boy said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan? Interesting. Izu pondered that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Should we get moving?” Kellin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative,” the boy replied. “They’re still searching for his location within the camp. Current orders are to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’ve found him! They’ve found him!” another messenger boy yelled out, coming up to the guardhouse in a dead sprint. He half-stumbled to a halt and paused to catch his breath. “They’ve found the Warlord! Champion Izu, the Lord General requests your presence in the Lower Court.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, lads and lasses! Let’s do this!” Izu called, grabbing his equipment. The others followed his lead. He donned and fastened his helmet, then raised his longsword high. “For the Queen! For Hyrule!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The whole room and everyone else within earshot took up the cry. Izu took the moment to hand off his carving and envelope to the first messenger, its “For My Family” title facing towards the boy.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Guards made way as Izu led the others into the war room of the Lower Court. Zelda, Shesan, and Wymar were present, as were High Captain Averil of Talus, High Captain Neri of the City Guard, First Lieutenant Tristain of Hylia’s Watch, and a dozen-odd other decorated officers that Izu hadn’t spoken to in years. They were all gathered around a large map of Castletown and its environs, littered with painted figurines, lines, and symbols.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu came to a halt and stood at arms. The Lord General returned the salute. “High Captain Averil: report,” Wymar commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Averil nodded sharply and stepped forward. “General, sir. Champion.” She nodded to Izu, gesturing to the map for his benefit. “We have just under one-hundred thousand soldiers ready to defend the city. Only around sixty percent of our original strength—most fatigued from the march back, unfortunately. But everything is in place, and all contingencies are ready should the Blin attack. On the upside, the Blin numbers are far fewer than we anticipated. Our scouts put it at around twenty thousand, with high confidence. A far cry from the ninety or so thousand that forced the retreat.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu heard a low whistle from Jedal behind him and he looked to Wymar worriedly. While it gave them considerably better odds in the current battle, that couldn’t be good news.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar responded without him needing to ask. “Confoundedly, we aren’t sure where the rest are located. We have reconnaissance out all across the countryside, but no actionable intel thus far. At present we are assuming their bulk is either holding Talus against counterattack, or have spread out to pillage. For now, this is our fight, and it demands our full attention. When we’re done here, we will adapt and respond.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes sir, understood,” Izu confirmed. “And the Warlord?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan cut in, stepping forward and pacing around the map. “The Blin are split up into sixteen camps around the city,” she said. “Each held together by a Lieutenant, and several-sub bosses under them. As fate would have it, the Warlord was in the last camp I checked.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu grunted. At least they found the bastard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar then gestured to High Captain Neri, who stepped up next, pointing with a wooden baton. “Scouts confirmed his precise location here, just moments ago.” She tapped at a large painted X. “As you are no doubt aware, there is a hidden passage between the Larmak district and the Hezpa estate that lets out in an old stone quarry nearby.” She traced out the route. Izu nodded, as did his team. He was indeed familiar with the route; they had made use of it when they left with Zelda on the expedition to Last Bastion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Neri continued. “The Warlord’s camp has between two-hundred to two-hundred fifty Moblins, and around eleven to twelve-hundred Bulblin. Not a single Bokoblin to speak of.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Curiouser and curiouser. Izu scratched his chin. The terms corresponded to words in the Blin’s own language, and served as a rough scale for threat assessment and classification. Bokoblins were smaller than the average Hylian, Bulblins around the same size to slightly bigger, and Moblins ranged in size from people like Gazra and Grenja to terrifyingly gargantuan beasts at the upper end of the scale. The Warlord he’d be fighting was easily twice Izu’s size, if not bigger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Neri went on. “This camp is further divided into twenty-two subcamps, with their numbers roughly equally distributed among them. Scouts have further confirmed the Warlord to be alone with the camp’s Lieutenant, close to the center of the camp.” She drew a winding line with her baton from the stone quarry to the X. “The path with the best cover has you sneaking past five subcamps. Here, here, here, here, and here.” She tapped five circles. Izu scrutinized the map and the route, committing details to memory. Neri stepped back as he did. “That’s all we have for now, Champion,” she said. “We’ll have recon keep an eye on you and relay information as necessary.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded. “Acknowledged.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked up from the map to see Zelda exchanging glances with Wymar and Shesan. Shesan waved a hand and stalked away, then the Lord General gave the Queen a hesitant nod and addressed Izu again. “One last thing,” he said. “There is an <i>unquantified</i> possibility that the Warlord may be in possession of a fragment of Power. If and only if the situation allows for it, you are to search for and retrieve the fragment should you find it. However, you are to prioritize yours and your team’s safety above all else. Conditional on successful neutralization of the Warlord, exfiltration is your top priority. Any questions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu saluted. “No, sir! Parameters understood. Requesting permission to engage.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Granted, Champion, and dismissed,” Wymar said. “Goddess be with you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu turned his head and barked the command: “Team! Fall out!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned to leave with the trio falling in beside and behind him in lockstep. They set out at an easy jog the moment they hit the streets.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“So… the Seekers, eh?” Jedal said as they trotted along through the dark caverns, lighting their way with imbued gemstones.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin didn’t respond.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I hear the Faith makes you take vows of celibacy,” Jedal tried again a moment later. “Is that right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Kellin said tersely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see. I see.” Jedal grinned, nodding. Pause. “So if that’s not the case, what’d you say if we—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Kellin said again. “Drop it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey—fine, fine,” Jedal said, waving a hand. “No harm, no foul.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Minds on the mission,” Izu said as they neared an elevator shaft. They all stepped onto the platform as Jedal hit the switch and leapt up to join them. Gazra reached out a hand and hoisted the man the rest of the way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a slow, clackity ride up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just keepin’ the mood light,” Jedal offered with a shrug. “Gotta remember what we’re fighting for. …So how about you, Gaz? Got anyone back home?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gazra grunted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Man of few words,” Jedal said, nodding. “You know, that’s why I like you, Gaz. Always dead-set. <i>Focused.</i>” He gestured forward in parallel lines with both hands, then turned his attention to Izu. “How ’bout you, Cap?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Izu said with a slight shake of his head. This guy. “Yeah. My wife, Meril.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nice, nice,” Jedal said. “Kakariko, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hillford.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm, yeah. Nice place this time of year.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you even been to Hillford?” Kellin asked skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, well, no,” Jedal said, fumbling, “but it’s still a nice part of the country. Ain’t that right, Cap?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Izu said with a smile, and left it at that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They neared the top of the lift and set out. No one said anything the rest of the way.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The team neared the exit to the quarry, stowing away their lights. It was a cool night, with still air—mostly cloudless. Decent conditions for the mission, though he would have preferred the cover of rainfall. As they reached the open air, Izu heard a woman’s voice in his mind: steely, practiced. “2-A, 3-B. Ten o’clock, thirty paces.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu turned to his team, all of whom signaled they received the same information. He directed Gazra to follow him, Jedal to hold position, and for Kellin to circle around to the ledge above them. Kellin lept and hoisted herself up a boulder, while Izu and Gazra got in position at the corner of the cliff, waiting for the patrol to near.</span>
<br><br>
<span>When the footsteps drew close enough, Izu gave the signal. Gazra bolted wide around the corner to shove his fist through a Moblin’s jaw, while Izu ran another through the heart with his longsword. Their two Blin slumped silently to the ground as a veritable hailstorm of razor-sharp ice felled three Bulblin bringing up the rear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu noted the silvery-black weapons they carried of varying sizes and shapes—twisted and sinister, all angles and jagged edges. Sure enough, the weapons puffed away into smoke a moment later, one after the other. He shook his head and doubled back for Jedal as Gazra began dragging the corpses back out of sight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A good start. Izu checked with the others after regrouping, who signaled they were ready. Together they crouched and moved swiftly across a short path and along the treeline, keeping low. The foliage provided ample cover from the first camp, and they made it past without further incident.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nearing the edge of the treeline, Izu gave the signal to halt. He couldn’t see nor hear anything from the camp ahead. That worried him. A moment later another voice sounded in his mind: “Second camp: no activity. Route clear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Leaving their cover, the team darted around the second camp to take position at the next waypoint, ducking behind a cluster of bushes. A few paces ahead, atop a shoulder-height boulder, stood a sentry who peered out into the darkness with the aid of a crude lantern. To Izu’s right, Jedal brought up his hand, waving it back and forth methodically. Motes of green energy swirled around his fingers, and the sentry’s head began to droop. A few seconds later and the creature slouched, then fell onto its back, snoring loudly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good work!” Izu clapped Jedal on the back. The man gave him a wry grin and a thumbs-up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was going much better than Izu anticipated. Over halfway there! The team continued to shuffle along, staying low and keeping to the shadows wherever possible. They hooked around the third camp and approached the fourth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu’s pulse rose as they neared and he began to make out sights and sounds in the darkness. Fifty or so paces out, he dropped to the ground and the others followed suit. Their worst fear was realized—the entire camp bustled with activity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enemy alert. Discretion advised,” a telepathic voice came.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Fick,</i>” Jedal muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Orders?” Kellin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu grit his teeth and drew his sword as a small band of gibbering Bulblins meandered too close for comfort. “Hold position; stand ready,” he whispered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was not good. Not good at all. They weren’t nearly close enough to make a break for it. If they had to fight here—</span>
<br><br>
<span>A strong gust of wind brushed past, drawing Izu’s attention. Just ahead, one of the approaching Bulblin stumbled into another, who shoved the first and let out a series of yips and squeals. The shoved Bulblin’s eyes flared up with a red glow as it yelled back and drew one of those horrible weapons, then stabbed the other through the neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu watched along with the others; alert, pulse pounding, not moving a single muscle. The killer roared out into the night, and its companions gave it a wide berth. The events provoked a much larger Moblin to roar out in response, who then bolted their way from the subcamp, shouting unintelligibly in their tongue. The victorious Bulblin shyed back as the bigger creature neared, and gave a shrill, subservient whine, only for the Moblin to cleave its head in twain and stomp on the corpse. The Moblin then turned to the others and barked more words in their harsh tongue. Those it spoke to turned and fled towards the camp as the Moblin continued along the outskirts, snarling and grunting as it went, apparently ordering the smaller ones to retreat and stand down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu caught Gazra’s eyes, who exchanged glances with Jedal. “By the Mother,” Gazra said. “I’ve never seen anything like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin gave a bemused huff. “You know what? Screw it. Remind me to buy you a drink if we make it back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal winked. “Aye lass.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took a few more minutes, but eventually the camp settled. Shortly thereafter, they got the message: “Clear to proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Steeling himself, Izu and the others rose and skulked along, then came to and crossed a shallow creek. They continued along it a short ways, then rounded a bend and slid down an incline, clinging close to the cliff face. Further along the creek was the fifth and final camp, while straight ahead was their target; a lone tent in the middle of a rocky steppe. Coming to a halt, Izu peered around the corner to his right—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—and snapped his head back as he spotted a patrol, merely thirty feet away. Not fast enough. He was pretty sure one of them had caught his eye. He heard barking and yipping, followed by movement in their direction.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Damnation,” he muttered. “Patrols. I think one of them saw me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Farore’s golden arsehole,” Jedal said crassly, readying his rapier and main gauche. “Now we’re in for it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re close enough,” Gazra said. “I’ll distract them while—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Izu countermanded. “Kellin, volley on my mark—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Roger!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gazra, Invigorate—chase down runners. Jedal, shockbolt any that get too close.” The men nodded. The sounds of the patrols neared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Steady,</i>” Izu whispered. The whole world seemed to go quiet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mark!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Immediately, Kellin rounded the corner as red energy sparked from Gazra, shooting up and down him from head to toe. He launched himself forward in a blur, just as Kellin let forth three spears of ice in rapid succession. She lept back as Izu and Jedal stepped forward to take position in front of her, weapons ready.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It proved unnecessary.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Damn, woman, you’re good,” Jedal said. Izu nodded in concurrence, pleasantly surprised. At their feet were two medium-sized Moblins lying face-down in a growing pool of blood, with a third on its knees clutching an ice-spear through the chest. It wavered and fell to the ground, jerking violently. A dozen paces away, Gazra launched himself at a fourth and final Moblin, shoving its head into the ground repeatedly. Jedal stepped forward and put his rapier through the back of the spasming Moblin’s head, bringing its life to a merciful end.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A moment later, and the team regrouped. They paused for a short break as Fi restored magic for Izu and Gazra Siphoned it to the rest of the team, topping everyone off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This is it!” Izu said, gesturing ahead with the point of his sword. A makeshift tent stood in the distance in front of a bonfire—roughly hewn wooden stakes draped with animal skins.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One last check with the team. They signaled their readiness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Move!” Izu commanded, and they set out at a brisk jog. Gazra took up the left flank, Jedal kept pace at his right, and Kellin brought up the rear. Sentries in the distance at the edges of the far camps cried out, followed by blaring war horns.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But it didn’t matter. They made it. Here they were, on the precipice of victory. Now all that remained, was—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“GUGWAYAH!” Izu bellowed, making sure to accent and break each syllable harshly as he had heard their kind do. “GUGWAYAH!” he shouted again at the top of his lungs. “MOKOBLIN, GUGWAYAH!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Around them, throngs of Blin closed on their position, the air growing heavy with their stench. Ahead, a mighty behemoth of a Moblin stepped out of the tent—tall and thick as a small tree, all rippling muscle and cords of sinew. And behind <i>him</i> stomped out an <i>even bigger</i> behemoth, the ground trembling in his wake.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu stood firm, leveling his sword at the Warlord as his team fanned out around him. He repeated the phrase again, loudly for all to hear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To his dismay, the Lieutenant turned around and exchanged words with the Warlord, who gave two deep grunts and crossed his arms. The Lieutenant then swung back and snarled at Izu before bellowing a challenge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well, fick. It seemed he would be fighting two duels this day.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother Above, guide my blade,” Izu prayed under his breath. “Let my body be an instrument of your divine fury.” He stood tall and raised his sword to skyward guard, hoping to every god in the heavens above that the mages back at the city would read his mind and wait to use the BMOTS for the second duel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They squared up, and the Lieutenant’s eyes burst aflame with Bloodrage as he bellowed into the night, hefting a massive spiked warhammer made of silvery-black steel that seemed to glow red in the moonlight. Izu caught sight of sparks in the distance as Jedal, Gazra, and Kellin prowled around, keeping the rest at bay.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lieutenant charged. Izu steeled himself, shifting his weight onto his back leg, prepared to lash out and strike—but the beast slowed to a trot and stopped just out of range, weapon wound up behind its back. He inched forward, snarling, daring Izu to take a step.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Now or nothing. Do or die!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu took in a breath and lunged forward in a practiced motion. His magic gave him forewarning as the Lieutenant let loose with a wild swing. Izu slid deftly under it and summoned a foothold.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Leap. Breath. Bank. Float!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Right on cue, energy from Fi shot through him, suffusing every fiber of his being with more power than he could possibly hold on to. Izu summoned the final foothold, then curled his legs and sprung into an arc, carrying him clear over the befuddled Lieutenant’s far shoulder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He swung his sword through, severing his enemy’s trapezius in a cut six inches deep. Izu landed and spun, dropping back into guard. The Moblin cried out in pain as blood gushed from the wound, then dropped to its knees.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wasting no time, Izu closed the distance, lunging forward and driving his longsword into the creature’s chest, silencing its cries. He then shoved the corpse free of his blade with a kick and held his blade aloft. Fresh blood ran down the edge for all to see.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He scanned the horde. Dead silence all around. A thousand Blin, it had to be. A sea of tusks and snouts, yet not so much as a grunt.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>This next one’s for you, Senni.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Feet planted, he swung his sword to the side, challenging the Warlord to single combat. “MOKOBLIN! GUGWAYAH!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu could hear his heart in his ears. His chest pounded, and his lungs heaved. The Blin around him slowly took up the cry. Quietly and scattered at first, then louder and louder until every one of them chanted in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>ሁሁᏆᏌ! ጠዐ-ᛕዐ-βᏓᏆᏁ. ሁሁᏆᏌ! ጠዐ-ᛕዐ-βᏓᏆᏁ.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Pale moonlight shone down from above, framing the chaotic scene in a surreal, haunting light. The Warlord held a Soulsteel greatsword in both hands, pumping it up at the sky as he turned back and forth with a deep and guttural howl that whipped his lackies into a frenzy. The flames of the bonfire in front of the tent seemed to kick up in response, casting a long, dancing shadow from the beast. A shadow that seemed at once too dark and uncannily real.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malign eyes locked onto his, and his adversary strode forward, picking up speed. Izu matched the Mokoblin’s pace—a brisk walk into a slow and steady jog, steadily closing the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With dawning horror, Izu realized how one-sided this matchup really was. His vision began to sharpen and distort as lines of possibility diverged in his mind, branching out faster than he could keep track of. Damnation—the Warlord was also a Blue mage, and likely had a stronger affinity at that. He cut back on his Foretelling before the feedback got out of hand, burning just enough magic so that he would not be caught off-guard by any tricks. He’d have to rely on the BMOTS. Any second now…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Almost comically, the Warlord tripped and stumbled, skidding to a stop and clutching his head. Izu <i>pounced</i>, landing on top of his quarry, driving his sword into its back with all his might. It struck true, and he buried it up to the hilt. The Warlord let out a pained shriek as he yanked the blade free and stabbed, again and again and again, until he was certain the wretched thing was dead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bastard,” he spat, ripping his sword free after putting an end to the Blight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finished, he frantically looked over his slain foe. It had jewelry and ornamentation a-plenty, but nothing that looked like a fragment of gold. Though one arm was curled underneath the corpse…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Blin were no longer silent. Cacophonous noise sounded out all around, and the hair on the back of his neck stood up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu flared his magic, and in his mind’s eye he saw the attack. He lunged to the side just in time to miss a Soulsteel spear jabbed between his shoulders. The strike cleared the air and went deep into the Warlord’s flank. Izu did not give his assailant the opportunity to recover, following through to swing around in an upwards cut that severed the Moblin’s forearm just above the elbow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu stalked forward and kicked the legs out from under it, raising his sword to deliver the killing blow. To end the life of this filthy, stinking, piece of—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Pain.</i> Fire and pain and agony. Izu stumbled back as he caught a massive, clawed fist to the chest. He coughed and wheezed, choking up a mouthful of blood. He staggered backwards, gasping desperately for breath, drowning on his own fluids.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Don’t panic. Don’t…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>So tired. So… tired. He glanced around, dizzy. Utter chaos. Most of the Blin were fleeing, but several of the larger Moblin were closing in. His team formed up around him. Jedal quickly dispatched the Moblin that attacked him, then ran up and placed a glowing hand on his chest, pushing a tide of Healing energy into his body.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Instant relief. Izu’s airway cleared and he could finally breathe. He noted Jedal was clutching the other hand to his chest—bloodied, with the better part of four fingers missing. When had that happened?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Warmth washed over him as the Healing took hold. His skin knit itself—“<i>Aaaaargh!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Pain once again flared up and Izu spat out another mouthful of blood, dropping to his knees.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Bloodrage. Of course it had to be <i>Bloodrage</i> that got him in the end.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were saying something. Voices around him. Voices inside his mind. He tried, but he couldn’t make any of it out. The pain was too much.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Reeling, he struggled to his feet and raised his sword. If he was going to die here, at least he could take a few more of these grubbers with him.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Master, four-o-clock,</i> Fi’s voice sounded in his head. <i>I have created an opening.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Confused, he turned sharply to see the Moblins there fighting amongst themselves. That left them wide open for an attack! All he needed was to—<i>urk.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite himself, he slumped, holding his weight on his sword. He cried out in agony. So much pain. Such burning pain…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal slapped him sharply, and the world came back into focus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There!” the lithe man pointed. “Kellin, take point! Gazra, rear! Move, move!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Jedal knelt down and threw Izu over his shoulders in a soldier’s carry. It hurt—by the goddesses, it hurt—but Izu didn’t dare move more than he had to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, Kellin carved a path through with shards of ice. Behind, Gazra’s mighty transformation tore through the enemy, smashing those Blin who dared to follow into giblets.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu felt faint and struggled to stay conscious. Eventually, darkness took him.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Izu opened bleary eyes to see a nurse standing over him. He winced in pain—all his senses felt too sharp. It was like a hangover, only worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse turned and called to someone out of his view. “He’s awake. Hey, do you hear me? I said, he’s awake!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu grinned. He was alive. Alive, and in the infirmary. Not dead. That was a surprise. He tried to raise himself to his elbows, but damnation did his head hurt. It left him feeling nauseous, so he laid back down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Easy. Easy, dearie,” the nurse said, dabbing his face with a cool washcloth. “You have acute—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Exhaustion, yeah,” Izu finished, wincing and taking a calming breath. He really pushed it back there. “Familiar. Very familiar. I’ll take it easy until I’m healed. Promise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse scowled at him skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“On my honor,” Izu said. He turned his eyes to the window, noting growing shadows. “How long’s it been?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nurse smiled back with a soft shake of her head, then went to fetch him a bottle of water. “A few hours. ’twill be evening soon. You’ve been out most of the day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She popped the cork on the bottle and passed it over. Izu took the offered bottle and drank eagerly. Cool. Refreshing. He finished and handed it back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The others?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” the nurse whispered softly. “They made it. Battle-torn, one of them, but they made it. Everyone. Not a single—” She put a hand to her mouth, tearing up. “Thank you, Champion. Thank the Goddesses for you. You saved the city.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu couldn’t help it. Basking in the warmth of victory, he laughed and—oof. He winced, feeling a sharp pain in his chest. He looked under his shirt to see a mottled web of scars over his left breast.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You broke a few ribs,” the nurse informed him. “Two impacted your lung. Bloodrage, I’m told, though we had plenty of Greens to make sure the Healing took. I’m optimistic about your recovery… but I’ve seen a few like this. You might not ever be as spry as you once were.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded grimly. They all knew from the Queen’s discoveries that Bloodrage could be healed—it just took many times the magic it took to heal lesser wounds. This led to an unfortunate state of affairs where wounded soldiers on the battlefield could <i>sometimes</i> be healed, but often weren’t because it meant several others would not get treatment. In this regard, the Queen’s discovery was a kind of cursed knowledge—giving false hope to many who now knew the affliction was not necessarily fatal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had gotten lucky. Far luckier than any man had any right to be. The mission had gone off nearly flawlessly, and from the sound of it, the Blin had broken. Just like that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The door swung open and none other than Queen Zelda entered the room. “Izu!” she cried, joyfully. “I’m so glad you’re awake! Oh, hello, Nilda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace!” the nurse gasped, taken aback. She shied away. “I’ll just, uh… I’ll…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nilda turned and scurried out the door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu raised an eyebrow. “What was that about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, nothing important,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Awkward silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen, Izu: I just wanted to be the first to congratulate you. I saw the whole thing. By the Goddesses, you were amazing out there! Splendid. Superb. <i>Magnificent!</i> I can’t wait to tell Arlinkar—oh, by the way, Arlinkar and his team are all alive and they’re headed to Kakariko with a second fragment of Courage. Ohh, we have so much to do! I can’t wait to get started—I mean, as soon as you’re healed of course." She paused to frown, then grinned and cocked her head, lifting a finger to her cheek. "…I think I’ll have a statue made in your honor. How does that sound?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu smiled, and only just kept himself from laughing again. “That sounds great, Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
