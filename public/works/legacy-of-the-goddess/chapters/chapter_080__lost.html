<span>A knock at the door woke Xayla from her sleep. She’d dozed off by the hearth—the fire had died down to embers, still warm but no longer crackling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enter,” she called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari. He stepped inside and closed the door behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rubbed her eyes and sat up straight. “Any news?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head with a grunt and took a seat across from her. “We put out bounties. That’s about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her guardsmen had identified two assassins in the crowd who’d attempted to shoot her during the speech. Their attack was followed by two more assailants rushing the stage with bombs—one from the crowd, another from the secured rear exit. Those two hadn’t survived the attack, and the shooters had escaped in the ensuing chaos. No one knew if there were additional actors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla was lucky to be alive, and she knew it. Two of her guardsmen had died protecting her, and another sustained minor injuries. Six civilians had been killed, with at least a dozen more wounded in the crowd. Laylith—the second of her two new Veilwyrd guards—had also collapsed from magical exhaustion after thinking quickly to entomb the second attacker in ice, preventing his bomb from harming anyone else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari,” Xayla said, leaning forward to touch his knee. “I never properly thanked you. You saved me today. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for you. Thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari rubbed his neck, a faint flush coloring his cheeks. “Heh. That’s my job, isn’t it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She smiled at him. He looked away, and she leaned back, studying him thoughtfully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think it could be the same group from before?” she asked, changing the subject. “The ones the messenger mentioned— ‘The Exiled King?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shrugged. “I don’t know who else it could be. Maybe Vesyrn? But he had a chance to kill you before and didn’t take it. Nothing’s really changed since then.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla winced at his casual recounting. “What about the Seekers?” she offered. “Just testing theories. Vestele did say they had ‘considered’ their options—a little ominous, don’t you think?” She paused, then shook her head. “But no, that doesn’t fit. Vestele was there. And why would they use bombs?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded slowly, his gaze drifting into the distance. Xayla waited patiently while he considered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re right,” he said at last. “I think there might be informants in the castle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla blinked. She hadn’t considered that possibility. “What makes you think so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They were too well-coordinated,” Ari said, eyes focused on the dying embers of the fire. “The shooters fired at the same time—right when the other two rushed the stage. That means they either coordinated the timing with a signal, or they planned it beforehand using something in your speech as the trigger. But the crowd was too dense for non-magical communication, and Laylith would have spotted anyone on the rooftops. She didn’t. And since they didn’t use any Blue magic in the attack—just bows and bombs—I’m assuming none of them were Blue mages. So unless there was someone else in the crowd who didn’t participate, that leaves only one possibility: they knew you’d be giving a speech there, and they knew what you were going to say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s eyes widened slightly as the logic clicked into place. He was right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There’s more,” Ari said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shot him a glance. “More?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The bombs,” he said. “I think they came from Talus. We used most of them in the initial assault, but not all. And there aren’t any other compromised stockpiles that I know of—something like that would be caught and reported immediately. The Akhari don’t have the resources to make explosives. Only we do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But if all that’s true, that would mean…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It would mean there’s a faction of Akhari working with the Blin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence fell between them as the realization sank in. Xayla considered the implications. “I suppose that would explain their coordination.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shook his head. “No. That doesn’t explain anything, actually.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla fought against the urge to argue back. She knew by now that he’d explain himself of his own accord. Eventually.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why would they work with the Akhari when they can barely work with each other?” he said after a moment. “There’s still something we’re missing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what other alternatives are there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla pondered aloud. “Perhaps the Lynx would know.” A thought occurred to her. “I’d like you to be there when we communicate with them. You’re insightful—you see things differently than I do. I want to hear your take on whatever they have to say.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari paused, seeming to consider her words. “I… yeah. I’d like that,” he said quietly. “Thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned her attention to the hearth. “In the meantime, any other ideas on what to do about this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded. “I’ve already sent messages to the Lord General and all the High Captains. Cove’s investigating the guard and staff. I’ll get Laylith on it too once she recovers.” He paused, seeming to consider. “Not sure what else to do right now. Maybe assign more Veilwyrd to the task? I know they’re busy elsewhere, but your security matters.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Proactive as ever. “Thank you again, Ari,” Xayla said with a warm smile. “I really appreciate your work. And your skills. You’re amazing, you know? I don’t know what I’d do without you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rubbed his neck again, that faint flush returning. “It’s nothing. I mean, the fragment did most of the work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re welcome, Xayla.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He cocked his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Say it,” she commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No ‘uh’s. Say it just like I did—with a straight face.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He regarded her for a moment, expression unreadable. “You’re welcome, Xayla,” he said, in a mock imitation of her voice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She couldn’t help but laugh. “Okay, wiseass,” she said, rolling her eyes and throwing a pillow in his direction. He laughed too.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey! You told me to!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sat up straighter as a thought occurred to her. “I think we should try to augment the guard. There have to be some soldiers or retired veterans in the city. You and the Veilwyrd could vet them thoroughly—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, that won’t work," he interrupted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla scoffed. “And why not?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because I’ve already looked into it,” Ari said. “Anyone who can hold their own in a fight has already been conscripted. And even if there were people, it’s too risky—it’d be the perfect opportunity for an assassin or informant to get close. I’d bet that’s how the other ones got in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Damn this man. Xayla wasn’t ready to cede the point, but she didn’t want to bet against him being right again. “Fine,” she said. “What about the city guard, then? Surely there are people willing to work extra shifts on patrol. At the very least, it would help with crime and make it easier to find the assassins.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded. “I asked about that too. Prime Counselor Taetus is handling it, apparently. They didn’t seem too keen on me interfering.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Taetus?</i> Xayla frowned. “Guard duty? What does that have to do with the food shortage?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shrugged. “I didn’t ask.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sighed. “I suppose I’ll have to check in with him later.” She stretched and stifled a yawn. “Anyway, it’s getting late. I should get back to bed, but—” She paused, glancing at him. “I’d feel safer if you slept nearby from now on. Would that be alright?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari?” she prompted gently. He sat upright, stiff as a board, his face nearly as red as the embers in the hearth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Wait, that’s not what I meant!” Xayla blurted, flustered. “I’m sorry, Ari. I didn’t mean it like that.” She buried her face in her hands, mortified. How could she have been so careless? Was there anything she could say now that wouldn’t make it worse?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I get it,” Ari said, shoulders slumping. “You’re a Queen, and I’m just your bodyguard.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Xayla blurted out before she could stop herself. “It’s… well… it’s not that simple,” she said, stumbling over her words as she tried to gather her thoughts. “Ari, you’re a <i>wonderful</i> man—truly. Any woman would be lucky to have you. You’re kind, intelligent, and incredibly brave. You’re a treasure to the whole kingdom! I just wish there were more people like you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But?” he asked, his tone tight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla winced, realizing how it must sound.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But I don’t… prefer men,” she admitted quietly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Oh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He suddenly seemed fascinated by anything in the room that wasn’t her. “So that’s why you and Sera—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yeah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Okay. That actually makes a lot of sense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence settled between them, stretching on uncomfortably—even by Arlinkar standards. Xayla struggled to think of anything else to say.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I should go,” Ari said abruptly, rising to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla almost called out to stop him, but exhaustion got the better of her. She folded her arms, resting her head on one hand. “Goodnight!” she called after him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodnight,” Ari called back. He left and closed the door, leaving her to stew in embarrassment and reflect on her clumsy handling of the situation probably every night for the rest of her life.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“He’s stolen all the crysts in town!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And raided our food stores!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—He dragged my father out of the house and flogged him in the streets!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And he’s holding public executions every morning at dawn!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Barbaric!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—The savage!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—If that ficking upstart commoner thinks he can just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Silence!</i>” Xayla yelled, slamming her gavel against the block. “The chamber will come to order! Bailiff, clear the room and send for the Prime Counselor. I will hear from him myself!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla’s jaw tightened as Taetus entered the chamber with an air of entitlement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Explain yourself,” she demanded, giving him no chance to settle. “Now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus halted, glancing around the chamber. Only her guardsmen were present besides the two of them. “You tasked me with resolving the food crisis, did you not?” he said, his tone almost nonchalant. “I’m simply carrying out your orders.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By robbing the Noble Houses? By flogging city lords in public and executing people as a spectacle? You can’t possibly expect me to accept that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He smiled with that <i>infuriating</i> grin of his. “Your Grace—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Spare me your excuses, Taetus! You have no idea how close I am to ordering my guards to take your head!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He straightened, meeting her gaze with a cool defiance. “Would you prefer I explain myself, Your Grace, or shall we continue shouting?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t test me, Taetus,” Xayla snapped.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He remained motionless, hands clasped behind his back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla drew a steadying breath, forcing her anger down. “Go on, then,” she said tightly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” Taetus said evenly. “If you would, allow me to explain before you pass judgment.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s glare did not waver.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The root of our problems is food, yes,” he began, “but most of the trouble comes down to overpopulation. Castletown is packed to nearly five times its intended capacity, and there’s nowhere else to send the refugees. There are simply more people than we can feed, and many aren’t able to contribute—some are even making things harder.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But how do you expect us to put them to work? We have to <i>pay</i> them, and we have to <i>feed</i> them.” He punctuated his words by slamming a fist against the other hand. “The Crown’s coffers alone aren’t enough. And since the nobles seem content to hoard their wealth while the common folk starve and fight over scraps, I have <i>temporarily</i> seized their money and half their food stores to put those resources to better use.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And before you object,” he said, raising a finger, “they have been compensated with bonds and scrip. Presuming the kingdom makes it through this crisis, they will be all the richer for it. In the meantime, I’ve charged the local city lords with managing their districts, and have begun issuing scrip for them to distribute to the populace as they see fit. It is to be awarded for honest work, and can be exchanged at stations I’m setting up throughout the city for basic goods and food—mainly soup and bread. Secondarily, this will allow the common folk to barter among themselves, thus allowing those with surplus to exchange their unneeded goods for food and other necessities. As a result, everyone will have greater access to food, which will give us room to make progress on the other issues.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And naturally, all of this is funded by the confiscated wealth,” he finished. “Every measure I’ve taken is <i>absolutely</i> necessary, Your Grace. I wouldn’t do any of it otherwise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Even the floggings?” Xayla asked, her tone skeptical. There was no way he could justify that—damned be his reasoning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Count Marlas of House Nen defied the Crown’s authority,” he said, his tone unwavering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Taetus, you <i>arrogant shit!</i>” Xayla snapped. “It doesn’t matter what I asked you to do! You <i>cannot</i> antagonize the nobility like this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But that is where you are wrong, Your Grace. <i>Your father</i> would not have hesitated—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>My father</i> would not be executing criminals in the streets just to make a point!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>King Gaillard</i> would not have sat idly by and watched the order in his city fall to thugs and gangs to begin with!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two of them glared at each other as the words settled. Xayla <i>seethed</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There will be no more flogging of nobles,” she said quietly. “And no more public executions. Now get out of my sight, before I reconsider letting you live.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command. Your Grace,” Taetus said with a curt bow. He turned and left the chamber.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla strode through the castle corridors in the evening light on the way back to her study. It had been yet another long and stressful day. She wasn’t sure what she would do when she got there, but any measure of respite would be welcome after the events of the past two days.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait! Your Grace!” someone called out behind her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Or not. She paused, recognizing Cove’s youthful voice. With a sigh, she turned to face him. “Yes? What is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, sorry to bother you,” he said as he caught up. “Nothing urgent. I just—well, I think these are yours.” He held out a small box and opened the lid.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside were her lost bracers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Cove!” Xayla exclaimed, snatching them from the box. There was no mistaking it; she recognized their draw instantly. These were <i>her</i> bracers. She traced her fingers along the ridges of their golden emblems. “How did you come by these?” she looked up. “Has Vesyrn been captured?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Cove shook his head, putting the box away. “I don’t think so. Sorry, but I don’t know anything else except for what I was told. They were handed to me by one of the agents you sent out on patrols—Malg, I think his name was? He said they were found on the body of a Dreadkin that was killed in a raid somewhere about a day’s ride to the north.” He scratched his head. “What a crazy coincidence, huh?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla laughed uneasily. “Yeah. What a crazy coincidence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Cove eyed her suspiciously. She hurried to change the subject. “Do you know if they found anything else by chance?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not that I’m aware of.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With care, Xayla slid the bracers back over her wrists. They fit snug to her skin. It felt right to do so; like some essential part of her had been missing all this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re magical artifacts, aren’t they?” Cove asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla started. “What? No,” she lied. “Just… sentimental family heirlooms. I inherited them from my mother. I don’t have much left from her, so they’re very special to me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s okay,” Cove said with a wink. “Your secret is safe with me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sighed and rubbed her face. “Thank you, Cove.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t mention it—it’s what I’m here for!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was there anything else?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Your Grace. That’s all,” he said cheerfully. “Oh, uh—still no updates on the assassins, if that’s what you’re wondering.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla curtsied before him. “Pass on my thanks to Malg as well, please. He has my gratitude.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish,” the young man said with a bow. He turned and sauntered off, whistling to himself as he went.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla leaned against the carriage window, watching the scenery drift by. It was a mild and breezy day in the middle of Calm. Their route traced a winding ravine to the left, while a dense green forest stretched out to the right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But where were they, exactly? She couldn’t recall…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This doesn’t look right,” a feminine voice at the reins ahead said. She sounded concerned. Xayla couldn’t place it, but the voice was somehow familiar. “I think we’re lost,” the voice said. “We should turn back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nonsense, Rirra,” Father replied gruffly. “I’ve ridden this trail plenty of times. We’ll reach the pass well before sundown. Just try to relax.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Wait. Rirra—that was her mother’s name!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother!” Xayla called. “Father?"</span>
<br><br>
<span>They didn’t seem to hear her. She repeated herself, edging toward the front of the cabin. “Mother? It’s me, Xayla!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She slid the front hatch open. Night had fallen, and the wind whipped past, howling in her ears. She held up a hand to shield her face and peered ahead. There, two figures sat in shadow, outlined by the pale glow of a distant moon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With growing dread, Xayla reached out and tapped the shoulder of the smaller figure on the right. The moment her hand made contact, her mother’s corpse snapped upright and unleashed a soul-piercing wail—her face gaunt and skeletal, empty eyes staring out into the abyss.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla screamed and stumbled backward into the cabin. The hatch slammed shut behind her as the carriage lurched forward, horses shrieking. The floor rocked violently beneath her, sending her sprawling onto something cold and rigid in the seat she’d just vacated. She screamed again, scrambling to her feet and spinning around. Pure terror gripped her as she recognized Father’s hollow, lifeless body. His eyes swiveled in their sockets to meet hers, and his hand rose to point at her as another terrible screech filled the air, rattling her very soul. The cabin shook again, and then she was falling—crying out, clutching the frame with white knuckles as the carriage plunged into the rushing waters below.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Xayla jolted awake, covered in sweat with her heart pounding in her chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was just a nightmare. Only a dream.</span>
<br><br>
