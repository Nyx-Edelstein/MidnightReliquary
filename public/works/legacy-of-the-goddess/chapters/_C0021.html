<span>“I can’t believe her! Argh!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda picked up an empty candelabrum and tossed it across the room. It hit the far wall of her study with a satisfying clunk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She continued to pace while Laylith stood off to the side, keeping her company. After Shesan’s latest stunt, Zelda had decided it was best to retreat and collect her thoughts. To get her emotions under control before she said or did something she might regret.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just who in damnation does she think she is, anyway?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A scared woman who’s a long way from home?” Laylith offered. “Someone who believes she’s trying in vain to save a world that’s not hers, risking her own life to do so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stared at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, she’s abrasive,” Laylith said. “And inconsiderate. And absolutely dismal. But she’s also on our side. It seems to me like she’s just trying to help, in her own peculiar way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t believe you!” Zelda said. “Are you really sticking up for her?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not even,” Laylith said. “It’s important to keep in mind context—that’s all I’m saying. Has she actually done any harm?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gaped at her. “Have you already forgotten what she did to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Today,</i>” Laylith said, rubbing the bridge of her nose. “I meant today.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda growled under her breath and crossed her arms. “No, I suppose not,” she said. “But I don’t appreciate her talking to Taetus without me. How am I supposed to trust her when she goes behind my back like that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was that really done ‘behind your back?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhm, yes?” Zelda said matter-of-factly. “She met with him without me, and that was not what we agreed on. What else would you call it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith shrugged. “It seems like a poor way to go about conducting a conspiracy, is all. If she wanted to be secretive about anything she discussed with the Counselor, she had ample time to cover it up—and yet she was just standing there when we arrived, seemingly waiting on you. Have you considered that maybe she just got there early and was trying to save time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. No way it’s that simple,” Zelda said, gesturing dismissively. “We’re talking about the same woman, right? Who knows what level she’s playing at. I wouldn’t put it past her to cover something up by hiding it in plain sight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is it really ‘hiding in plain sight’ if she—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Oh, come on!” Zelda said indignantly. “Whose side are you on, anyway?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know I’ve sworn my life to you,” Laylith said severely. “And, once again, I am not taking her side. I’m just offering a different perspective and challenging your assumptions—that’s all. It’s part of my job.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda snorted. “Yeah, okay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m serious,” Laylith said. “If it weren’t for my duty, I would not be defending that woman. I would hate for you to think less of me for it, but if that’s what it takes to get you to see reason, then—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Wait, really?” Zelda said. “You’re serious? That’s really a Sheikah thing?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, dearie,” Laylith said. “It’s part of our training. All Sheikah who serve as retainers go through it. Among other things, we’re tasked to provide impartial counsel, and when necessary, ensure our charges are informed and that their decisions are well-considered. Sometimes that means arguing on behalf of people like Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” Zelda said. “Wow. I just assumed… Anyway,” she said, brushing aside the thought. “You don’t think Shesan’s dangerous?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course I think she’s dangerous,” Laylith said. “But you don’t need me to tell you to be more wary of her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed. “I understand what you’re saying. I do.” She paced over and sunk into her comfy reading chair. “I know I’m biased when it comes to her. And Taetus too. Usually I have no problem thinking in the abstract. It’s just… difficult to set aside my emotions. Especially when it… involves me so personally,” she said softly. “But that’s why I’m here talking with you, and not out there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmph. There you go, being all understanding again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can be more difficult if you’d like. Want me to try a Shesan impression?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goddess, no,” Zelda said with a laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked at the older woman fondly. “Thank you, Laylith. I appreciate you. Really. And I don’t mean to take out my frustrations on you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s my pleasure to serve, Your Grace,” Laylith said with a smile and a nod.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘You’re welcome, Zelda,’” Zelda said under her breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You really don’t like that, do you?” Laylith asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I don’t,” Zelda said. “It makes me feel less like a person and reminds me of an ideal I can’t ever hope to live up to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can understand that,” Laylith said, nodding. She stepped over and took a seat nearby.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waited for more, but Laylith said nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So what do you think I should do?” she asked after a moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“About the marriage proposal?” Laylith asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, what do you want to do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know,” Zelda said, flustered. “That’s why I’m asking you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pretend for a moment there are no consequences,” Laylith said. “Just humor me. What would you do if you could get away with it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know!” Zelda repeated. “Kick Shesan in the face and throw Taetus into the deepest, darkest dungeon I can find so that I never have to look at him again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what’s stopping you from doing that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda set her hands on her hips. Laylith regarded her seriously. She was doing that <i>thing</i> again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan’s useful,” Zelda said, playing along. “So is Taetus, I suppose. And he doesn’t deserve that, if I’m being honest.” She shifted in her seat. “<i>She</i> does though. A nice firm kick, right to that infuriatingly pretty face of hers. Break her nose and make it all crooked and screwed up and ugly. It would serve her right for being such an insufferable bitch all the time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith nodded. “So Shesan’s useful, and so is Counselor Taetus. What else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed. “She understands me. That’s part of what makes it so frustrating. She thinks like I do—she just doesn’t have any tact and doesn’t care if she hurts anyone while doing what she thinks is necessary.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So you’re considering her suggestion?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, it wouldn’t be the worst thing to keep Taetus in charge, at least for a while longer. There’s so much else I should be doing rather than holding court and dealing with paperwork and babysitting prissy nobles who take offense if I sneeze the wrong way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith motioned for her to continue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s just… well, you saw Lensa. Even if there’s absolutely no truth to her concerns—which I doubt—there would be serious repercussions to letting him continue to run things. And I can’t think of any better solutions, even if Shesan’s plan has complications. As much as I hate to admit it, she might be right. By the Mother, I’m always saying that, aren’t I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So why don’t you talk to him about it, without Shesan around? Ask his opinion on the matter, and try and understand his perspective. I’d be happy to sit with you if it helps.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, I suppose I should,” Zelda muttered. “I was already considering marking him, too—if nothing else so that I can have Fi can keep an eye on him. Maybe I should also have her compel him to tell me everything while we’re at it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think that’s wise?” Laylith asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What, you think I shouldn’t?” Zelda said. “If he has nothing to hide—then, well, he has nothing to hide.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm,” Laylith said, pondering. “Well, if you think that’s the best way to handle the situation, then you should go for it. I just think you should at least consider how that might affect him first.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do you mean?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith considered for a long moment, tapping her fingers together on her lap. “Well, are you trying to work with the Counselor, or keep him under your thumb? In most circumstances, I imagine being magically forced against one’s will to divulge private information might garner some resentment.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something in that caught her attention. Zelda sat up straight, puzzling at Laylith’s words. Not just her point, but the way she phrased it. In most circumstances? Against one’s will? That was an intentional choice of framing, wasn’t it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Impartial. Abstract. Not colored by emotion and personal feelings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Am I really that dense?” Zelda asked meekly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith smiled at her. “I’d say you’re pretty sharp, dearie.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda considered the question seriously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suppose I don’t have to do that right away,” she said. “I will have you and Fi to make sure he’s not hiding anything important.” She nodded. “Okay, yes. I’ll wait and see how it goes first before I resort to violating his mind with Old Magic as a means to getting out of the room sooner. How does that sound?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith chuckled. “I would say that sounds eminently reasonable.”</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span>“Master: I—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ack!” / “Aaah!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—have an urgent update for you. Zelda wishes for me to inform you that she may request for me to attempt to mark ‘Prime Counselor Taetus’ later this evening, depending on the outcome of her conversation with him. As this will require the entirety of my attention for multiple hours, she recommends you avoid any and all activities that pose substantial risk, or that which may require my services in the interim. Specifically, she urges you to postpone the expedition to the presumed location of Ibboso and his tribe until after the attempt to mark Taetus has been completed, or until she otherwise decides against this course of action. Further, she wishes for you to know that she intends to provide you with updates as the situation evolves.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Got it,” Link said, red faced. “Thanks Fi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, Master.” Fi spun once in the air, then disappeared into the aether.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Awkward,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry. I asked her not to do that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know, Link,” Ryn said dryly. “I was there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh.” Link rubbed the back of his neck. “Wait, didn’t I already tell Zelda that we weren’t going until tomorrow?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, at this point I’m pretty sure she knows exactly what she’s doing.”</span>

<br>
<span>Invigorate. The usage of a weapon with this magic is itself a rare art, usually found only in those of us gifted with the talent upon our initiation to the order. While many limit themselves in its application to petty brawling, there is so much more to be had through [unintelligible Fi-speak]. While most unintuitive and assuredly difficult, this art can indeed be learned…</span>
<br><br>
<span>[The next two pages are too faded for Fi to make out. They look very worn and the spine is creased here. Fi suggests the manual was likely left open for a long time on this page.]</span>
<br><br>
<span>The author’s own fighting form, Flames Dancing Amidst the Trees, relies greatly upon usage of this technique to obtain bursts of strength and speed to surprise the enemy whilst dodging oncoming blows, before performing a snakelike counterattack. This form is suitable for those of lithe builds yet supple in strength. For those trainees of more formidable proportions, the author recommends Striking as The Granite Talus. More detail can be found in the volumes of the same names. The basics remain the same in any case.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One should take care to practice their movements until they become natural, and to keep in mind that adjustments will have to be made from the norm else they will overswing or otherwise compromise themselves. This is why most find it easier to use this magic with their fists and limbs alone. Nevertheless, the aspiring Red Magus should practice this technique until gaining modest proficiency.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The following diagrams outline the suggested alterations to the familiar katas with spear, sword, and stave, though slight adjustments can be made to other weapons as needed...</span>
<br><br>
<span>[The next thirty-seven pages are illustrations of people going through the forms, with sporadic notes from the editor.]</span>
<br><br />
<span><u>Personal note:</u> I never paid this any mind until now, but sure enough my own use of sword and shield with Invigorate is noticeably different than without. I tried some of the katas and found that I already knew them as if I had practiced them for years. Strange. As the manual says, I guess I was “gifted with the talent.” Unfortunately this does not translate to other weapons; I tried it with a makeshift quarterstaff and nearly threw out my back.</span>
<br><hr>
<span>Of Transformation, there is much to say and much use to be found. Nenais the Eagle, Lightsworn of legend, was such a learned practitioner of this magic, that she was able to so transform herself, but only partially, in such a manner as to perceive all around her perfectly with her enhanced sight. Having discovered this wondrous application, she did teach it to her students of the Fire Temple, until it has found its way to myself. Though not all may find this method of partial Transformation useful given their forms, undoubtedly the average warrior will find some application. [unintelligible], and so [lots more gibberish] may be helpful in predicting this. One should be warned however that [even more Fi-speak], and so having a competent Green Magus on hand will undoubtedly be required for safe practice, should forcible reversion be required. The author stresses that the training is not to be rushed. Once a stable Transformation has been established, however, the student is encouraged to be creative, within acceptable bounds. Some applications, which do depend on the user’s form, include…</span>
<br><br>
<span>[Lots and lots of rambling after this about anecdotes of various people, like a guy who became a renowned sommelier using his jackalbadger nose. Then the editor goes on at length about “Nenais the Eagle” being the most amazing person ever and the greatest archer ever known.]</span>
<br><hr>
<span>Perhaps the most difficult Red magic to utilize is that known to us masters as Stasis, or more commonly, the Basilisk’s Gaze. By affixing one’s will and red affinity towards an individual, one can freeze them in time itself. To those who know this magic, the following may prove a useful application.</span>
<br><br>
<span>After the requisite twelve seconds of concentration and uninterrupted magical contact [?] the effect manifests. Master Jirro, my own teacher, in particular was noteworthy for using such in combat. After closing the distance and keeping pace through a succession of exchanges aimed at maintaining opposition, he would freeze his opponent and immediately end the engagement with a decisive blow once the effect ended. Though such “stutter-stepping”, as he called it, he would end every engagement with a single blow which, most clearly, none could hope to counter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As a cautionary note, one should not engage in close quarters with a hostile Red Magus of sufficient skill, for precisely this reason. As a further cautionary note, one should never engage in close quarters with a hostile Red Magus of superior skill for any reason.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The author does not recommend attempting this technique aside from a one on one confrontation. Else you risk death due to, for example, a boulder thrown from behind while you weren’t looking, as was the unfortunate fate of Master Jirro.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another interesting application of this ability is that of momentarily freezing oneself. As the contact requirement is trivially met, one must only maintain concentration. This is useful, but obscenely dangerous to do in live combat. One should absolutely not attempt this unless the need is dire and no other remedy will suffice. We cannot all be so skilled as Mistress Shivi the Unbreakable, to perfectly time our magics to break our enemies’ weapons.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The author cautions the trainee that this magic requires substantial reserves, as magic must be expended proportional to the mystical fortitude of the opposing magus. It is not to be attempted without first acquiring these reserves, and certainly not without the strict supervision of one who has already mastered it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There have been some hints in legend of applying this magic at scale to isolate all within an entire volume, but while admitting the theoretical possibility of such, the author has little faith in its practicality to the average user, or even group of users, and so questions the veracity of these claims. The expenditure would be entirely monstrous in scale, well beyond what any mortal could hope to achieve. Only the combined efforts of the strongest Red Magi in the world could hope to accomplish this feat, and for a small length of time at that.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Personal note:</u> That’s all I can find on Stasis. Leave it to stodgy old masters to describe an insanely useful lost art in great detail, all the while telling you why you should never use it and omitting any actually usable instructions.</span>

    <span>Excerpt from <i>Crystalline Precision: Wielding the Mind</i></span>
</div>
<br>
<span>Foreword by Grandmistress Lyr, the Untouched:</span>
<br><br>
<span>Blue magic is subtle and oft underappreciated. We are not simply messengers and scouts, nor simply the beating heart of our order without which all would fall into confusion and anarchy within a season. No; Lightsworn specializing in Blue have the highest combat potential of all, even if the art to turn our foes’ blood to acid has been lost to the ages. Truly, the Blue mage with sufficient discipline can control her battlefield as well as she can control her own mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Take Oshi the Oshniscient. A silly epithet, I will admit, but let that be a lesson that magical puissance translates into cachet in other arenas. Grandmistress Oshi began her career as a pioneer, only to blaze paths so fierce that few have been able to match aught but her first steps. She invented Coordination, combining Scrying and Telepathy to create the small unit tactics we teach to this day. If that were not enough, she then went further, joining the fray herself while guiding and directing her own allies at the same time. You’ve seen the murals in Old Byrna, surely: Oshi’s eyes blazing blue, her face directed towards the Mother in all her glory, her body dismantling all around her, her mind seeing and knowing all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Take Farin the Fearless. She elevated the technique of Coldstepping to an artform, seemingly leaping through the air, bounding from ephemeral footholds in a manner that confounded and confused even the most capable of adversaries. In my youth, I had the good fortune to personally witness her wrath unleashed upon the battlefield. I watched in awe and transcendent wonder as she alone felled an entire throng of Blin, darting to and fro, shards of ice raining death from above, below, within, and without.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Take Sgmorga the Troll. A despicable Blin to be sure, but a brilliant one, possessed with all the low cunning of her race and gifted with a rare Blue affinity. Let her story be a lesson that the saying “ware the power of words” is not merely metaphorical, and as a reminder that a moment’s inattention on the battlefield can be more fatal than the strongest Invigorated blow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We all, of course, have heard endless tales of Foretelling’s awesome and terrible power. It is the one facet of our magic that even the most arrogant Red mage or cocksure Green knows to respect and fear. Most of you reading this likely plan to center your entire combat style on this art. My own style is largely based around judicious Foretelling, and so I can hardly fault such plans. But at the same time I urge moderation. Common sense is oft mistaken for magic, and magic can never substitute for a moment’s consideration backed by a lifetime of trained instincts. Knowing the future helps not when all it holds is an Invigorated fist hurled faster than you can dodge, or the endless fuzz of Opportunity obscuring your vision.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There are subtle nuances to Foretelling that I would urge you to well consider. While a Green mage might glide through difficulty in blithe ignorance, or a Red bull through all problems with a recklessness known only to their kind, ours is a path of forethought, clarity, and discipline. Even a moment of Foretelling can provide much sustenance for the appetent mind. As an example, I in my youth lacked the confidence to assert myself in social situations. I would hide in the back of any gathering, scared to speak lest I be mocked. But I was a clever girl, you see, and so spent all my reserves looking into the future again and again and again until I stumbled upon one where a quip or a comment was met, not with derision, but with laughter and praise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I outgrew such childishness quickly, praise be unto the Goddesses, but it taught me a valuable lesson about the flexibility of our art. Look for circumstances in your own life, no matter how trivial, where one or two attempts without consequence would benefit you, and use them as opportunities to grow, both as a Blue mage and as a person. Cultivate Wisdom. Practice such that you become one whose instincts, mind, and body are honed to perfection, whereby knowing the future enhances your already capable self, rather than allowing your magic to become a crutch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As the Zora say: Wisest Nayru speaks most oft to those who listen. Become the sword of Hylia’s Wrath, my friend, and let Nayru’s magic flow through you.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Personal note:</u> Grandmistress Lyr sounds so cool. I shared this with Ryn. She loved it.</span>

<br>
<span>Soothe. Now there’s an underdog if I’ve ever seen one. Your Red-heads and Blue-ballers will tell you it isn’t good for anything but schmoozing at parties, lulling people into a false sense of security before shivving them (also usually at parties), or managing morale by calming down soldiers who, for some reason, feel a bit panicky about being thrown into the meat grinder in the face of devouring hordes of darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unfortunately, they’re right in this case. Soothe is boring. It sucks. Yeah yeah you can get better at it. Learn to modulate and target the pulse, blah blah blah, but that’s all effort and training you could have put into something actually useful. Like punching people. And all the psychological prep you need to “achieve inner peace in even the worst conditions?” Blergh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Editor’s note: Herein is inserted an extensive treatise on achieving inner peace under tension, as well as the philosophy and psychology of mental manipulation. The editor apologizes profusely for Master Zobor’s disparagement of the art, and promises prospective initiates that Soothe is indeed a quite varied and useful magic of incalculable value, when wielded appropriately.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Personal note:</u> This guy sounds so much like Grenja it’s not even funny.</span>
<br><hr>
<span>Now it’s time we talk Opportunity! Mother’s sweet mercy, do I love that one. Do you know one time I Opportuned (?) up so hard I killed a Warlord and ended a blight before it started just by walking up and running him off a cliff? It was amazing! Let me tell you what. I loudly challenged him to Gugwayah in front of all his lackeys (that’s Blin for “single combat” for the uninitiated), and he had no choice but to accept. Then I just strolled on over while he kept tripping over his own feet! I shit you not, he just kept dropping his weapons and flailing around in the mud like a wild grubber, until eventually he gave up and tried to run. Without even looking where he was going, he mounted his oxgoat and ran it right off a cliff!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Editor’s note: The veracity of several details in this account are disputed.</span>
<br><hr>
<span>Soothe’s about as lame as it gets, and is all about achieving inner peace and shit. Foretelling makes you work your ass off to make sense of nonsense and all that. Invigorate is powerful, sure, but it also takes a lifetime of work and dedication to be any good. But Opportunity? Opportunity is all about making the world your bitch for just long enough to make a difference. And the best part? No effort required.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Your subconscious—the least appreciated of consciousnesses—burns up the magic you give it to prune off all the futures it doesn’t like. Now you had better listen when I tell you to let little Subby do his job! As soon as you try and take the reins your super-conscious screws it all up and blows all the magic like the fat-fingered oaf you are. Naw, boss, that ain’t it. Just let the mellow roll and be sure to re-up whenever things start feeling harsh, and you’ll have smooth sailing, I guarantee it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Now I told you my great story about Opportuning Mardor the Dread off a cliff. “But Zobor,” you ask, “how could you possibly have used your Opportunity so powerfully? Didn’t you say that using more magic just makes it last longer?” Why yes, yes I did, bright student.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Editor’s note: Omitted is a crude (though masterfully detailed) illustration of Master Zobor tapping his nose with his finger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>You see, those of us who have truly mastered Opportunity can [Fi-speak]. It doesn’t take much, just that little bit. Now don’t get me wrong. It’s unreliable and expensive as hell, and if you get the timing wrong you’re going to have a bad day. But you too can learn this technique if you eat your greens and practice your Greens and…</span>
<br><br>
<span>[The next several pages are missing.]</span>
<br><hr>
<span>Now, here’s my last word on the subject of Opportunity (which again, is the best magic ever). Rule number one: keep an eye out for those ficking fuzzing Blue mages harshing your vibe. See, Foretelling and Opportunity don’t play nice together. “Exponentially increasing divergence” as the stuffies call it. Sure as shit, it gave me the Mother of all headaches the first time I tried to Foretell with it up. But! If you really lean into the Blue and learn how to manage the headaches and limit your magic use to almost nothing, it’s a neat trick to pretty cheaply and reliably see if your Opportunity is still up. More importantly, you can see if the other guy’s Opportunity is still up, break it intentionally, and then turn his brainpan inside out before he has time to reapply it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If that sounds dangerous, it is. Watch out for Blues.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Personal note:</u> It seems like “Opportunity” is what we call “Luck.” It also sounds like there’s more to it that’s been forgotten. And Zobor’s account about Foretelling makes sense. I accidentally did the same thing back at the first bandit camp we ran into without even realizing.</span>
<br><hr>
<span>Now, Healing gets a bad rap as a “support magic” or “only good for cleaning up after the cool kids are done”, and from my entirely justified opinion on Soothe you might come to the incorrect assumption that I don’t hold Heal, another “support” magic, in high regard. You’d be wrong. And also an idiot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I can count on all the fingers of both my hands how many times a well-done Healing has saved my life, and that’s only because of all the times I’ve had those fingers reattached over the years. See, Healing lets you push harder longer and recover from your many and varied mistakes. And as I always say: if you aren’t making mistakes, you aren’t trying hard enough. So don’t let me ever catch you shitting on anyone who focuses on it. If you have any self-respect at all you’ll learn at least a bit of it yourself. At the very least, learn enough of it to un-wereanimal your buddy when she tries to Transform while drunk on a dare.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Editor’s note: Here, I believe Master Zobor refers to the account wherein he challenged Mistress Netra to a game of orcolchi at a party. As the story goes, the situation quickly escalated. Refer to <i>Masters of the Past and How They Avoided Death (Vol. 3)</i> for more detail.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Personal note:</u> Is he saying that Healing can reverse Transformation? Because if so, that sounds really useful.</span>
<br><hr>
<span>Now the idiots in the audience will tell you that Healing isn’t magic-efficient, that you need to dump half your reserves into a guy just to heal a papercut, and that the papercut opens up again an hour later anyway so why bother. They only tell you that, because as well as being dumb they don’t have the magic-sense Hylia gifted a kodongo.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What we call “Healing” is actually two abilities: Restoration and Regeneration. Restoration is what does the really cool shit, like reattaching fingers and regrowing eyeballs and all that. It works by [lots and lots of Fi speak here]. Problem is, Restoration is temporary. It doesn’t [more Fi-speak]. It can also easily get shocked off of you by another hit, or just by pushing too hard. That’s why you have to use just enough Restoration to close the gaping wound or get the eyeball back, and only then do you kick in just enough Regeneration to help the body along to [a full minute of gibberish from Fi here, I’m not even joking].</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sad thing is, idiots these days just dump all their magic into both at once and achieve fuck-all. But let me tell you, the true masters get the proportions and timings just right and they’ll have you scaring Warlords off of cliffs again within the fortnight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Editor’s note: Master Zobor is particularly fond of this story, the veracity of which I must again remind the reader, is heavily disputed.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Personal note:</u> I immediately took this one to Koja. She just looked at me funny and said “Yeah, duh. Anyone who’s actually competent knows that.” Well, Koja, it was news to me.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Fick, fick, fick!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Almost out of breath, Zelda paused to collect herself after dashing from her study to the castle sanctum. After all that mess, she had nearly forgotten about her meeting with Vestele!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Heart still thumping in her chest, she smoothed out her hair and—as calmly as she could manage—strolled past the guards, around the stone building, and to the private courtyard where she and the High Priestess had planned to discuss matters over afternoon tea.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Predictably, Vestele was already waiting for her, sitting alone at a well-supplied table. She wore a nice white sundress and a wide-brimmed hat to shield her face from the midday sun. Zelda lamented that she had not taken the time to change out of her travel clothes. Mother Above, why was she so bad at these things?</span>
<br><br>
<span>At least the weather was nice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So kind of you to finally join me, Your Grace,” Vestele said mirthlessly as Zelda approached. She swirled a cup in her hand. …Wow, had she been drinking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My sincerest apologies,” Zelda said, clasping her hands in front of her with a slight bow. “I hope you haven’t been waiting long.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“About an hour, actually,” Vestele replied. “Though admittedly, I did arrive a few minutes early.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda covered her face. An hour?! By the Mother, she felt like she could just die right here and now. “I am so, so sorry, Vestele,” she said. “I had… something unexpected come up. I really didn’t intend to keep you waiting for so long.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, no, it’s fine,” Vestele said. “You don’t need to apologize to me, Your Grace; I understand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele rubbed at her brow with a finger. Zelda bit at her lip anxiously. This was already not going well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She decided to take a seat and jump right into it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let me start by saying: it was not my intention to involve the Faith in secular matters. I have great respect for our progenitors and their wisdom. Our kingdom and our culture has, for better or worse, withstood the test of time, weathering countless wars, turmoils, and blights. And despite recent revelations, it’s important to remember that this taboo was put in place for a reason. Truly: If I did not believe the situation was as desperate as it is—and if our resources were not already stretched so thin—I would never have asked this of you.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still, you must concede that my decision was not entirely in error,” she continued. “To hear the reports, you have indeed managed to forestall a crisis. And for that, you have my eternal gratitude. What’s more—I’ve had time to think about our time at the temple. I deeply regret what happened with Niesis, and… I’m sorry. I apologize for not listening to your wise counsel. You were right, and I hope not to repeat my mistake in the future if at all possible.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele sighed. “I have no idea what you believe I’ve done, but as I said to you in my letter, my role has been little more than perfunctory. It’s Counselor Taetus who deserves credit, not me. I’ve been little more than a go-between for him and the sages: overseeing the meetings between them and Zora leadership.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>So she had said. Zelda wasn’t sure how much stock she should put in that claim, versus how much was simple humility. One thing she had come to understand more recently—as evidenced by Father’s example—was that often the hallmark of an effective leader was knowing who to delegate to, when to let them work, and when to intervene. Such applied equally to her as it did Vestele. Who else but Vestele could have allowed those meetings to happen?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda decided not to voice as much, instead mentally filing the thought away for later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen, Vestele—I don’t even know where to begin,” Zelda said, shifting tack. She looked off into the distance. “There’s so much to tell you. So much I’ve learned. I met a woman named Shesan out in the desert, who allied herself with the Sunseekers many years ago. She’s not from this world. She showed me a vision of the evil behind all our woes—a great serpent coiled around the world. <i>Demise</i>, is what we call it. She says it’s the same force that defeated Hylia in ages past. The Blight? Ja’bu? It’s all his doing. It’s all been orchestrated by him, and executed by his servant, an exiled Gerudo king named Ganondorf. A man once known to them as the ‘King Among Kings,’ ousted from their nation after years of famine and adversity and following a series of betrayals. The same man who tried to have us both killed. All of it—every bit of it—has been masterminded by this… dark god. Demise. And it won’t stop there. He’s after the Triforce, and we have no idea why.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked back to the priestess. Vestele, for her part, set down her chalice and looked to the heavens. She sighed, shaking her head. “And this woman—Shesan? How do you know you can trust her?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She’s no Fae, if that’s what you’re asking.” Zelda answered. “I know that much for certain. She doesn’t look anything like Niesis—like Hylia. She’s tall, has round ears and strange eyes. I’ve never seen anyone like her. She really isn’t from here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t answer my question,” Vestele said. “Do you have any way of verifying her claims? How do you know this vision wasn’t simply a ruse to gain your confidence?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated. “I have Fi. She can tell when someone is lying and when they’re sincere, and she’s even caught Shesan a time or two. Admittedly, I have little to go on other than her word, but… you have to believe me, Vestele. Everything fits. She… she was the one behind Vesyrn’s betrayal. She’s been working from the shadows for years, trying to keep the fragments out of Ganondorf’s hands without drawing attention. According to her, he already has <i>five</i> fragments of Power, and is actively seeking the rest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry, I just…” Vestele steepled her fingers. “My first thought is, what if this woman is yet another adversary? Perhaps I’m just being paranoid, but nothing you’ve said so far assuages this fear; quite the opposite. I can’t help but be suspicious. Who is she? What stake does some strange woman from another world have in our kingdom?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “I understand. I too was wary of her at first—I still am, in some ways. Admittedly, she has been rather secretive, and I’ve not been able to get much out of her about the source of her motivation. But I do believe our goals are aligned, at least for the time being. We share a common enemy, and a powerful one at that. As much as I’m loath to suggest it, perhaps you should meet with her yourself?” Zelda grimaced. “It’s just, well, you should be warned: she doesn’t have the most charming of personalities. Interacting with her—tolerating her, even—is a chore. And equally important to note: even if she is on our side, she cares much less about us than stopping Demise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele nodded. “Very well. I’ll take your word for now. I suppose I’ll just have to see this woman for myself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t suppose you’ve heard of other accounts of travellers from other worlds?” Zelda asked curiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Vestele said. “Not even once have I heard of such an account, though I do find the prospect most interesting. There are worlds beyond ours? Were they too protected by Hylia? Created by the Golden Three? I have so many questions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t say,” Zelda said honestly. “By all means—feel free to ask, but you shouldn’t get your hopes up. As I said, she isn’t likely to answer such questions. What’s more, to hear her say it, she isn’t particularly fond of ‘our Goddess,’ either.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele grunted, sinking into her seat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised an eyebrow as she studied the older woman. “Aren’t you concerned?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“About?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Demise? All the rest I’ve told you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not really,” Vestele said casually. “By all accounts, our world has been falling apart for ages. In that view, it’s obvious that recent happenings are merely the latest in a chain of events stretching back to antiquity. Even if I am surprised to find so much happening in my own lifetime…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan doesn’t seem to think so,” Zelda countered. “She believes Demise is making such bold moves now precisely because Hylia is no longer in the way to stop him. You remember our previous conversation, right? What I told you from the siege?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Right, that,” Vestele said. She reached for her cup and emptied it with a gulp. “I suppose I’ve yet to reconsider old thoughts in light of new information. Hopefully you’ll forgive an aging woman—before talking with you, I had always assumed the Mother Goddess had been dead for ages. Hmph. I suppose my mind isn’t as sharp as it once was.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded with empathy. “It’s a lot to deal with, and there’s so much else to occupy our attention. I don’t blame you at all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A lull in the conversation. Zelda decided to press on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There’s something that concerns me,” she said. “You know of Morudo Geira, right? You mentioned that to me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shrugged. “Stories. Rumors. Legends. They say the Gerudo sacrificed their own children, throwing them to her maw in exchange for power and prosperity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right…” Zelda muttered. “Yes, that was more or less what I got from Naibi and Shesan. Naibi, by the way, is the actual leader of the Sunseekers. Baroness of House Sunseeker, now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele nodded curtly. “So, your concern?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, Geira?” Zelda said. “Ja’bu? I’m worried there’s more to it. Are there other ancient evils that Ganondorf might reawaken? There’s the Zora and the Gerudo… what about the Gorons?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele considered for a long moment. “That would complete a pattern, yes, and make sense from a certain perspective. Though nothing comes to mind, unfortunately.” She sat up. “There is one who might know: Sage Asdrum the Ancient. He was once a part of the Order—still is technically, though none have heard from him in ages.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A Goron? You think he’s still alive?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who’s to say?” Vestele said. “Gorons on average aren’t nearly as long-lived as Zora, though the eldest among them may be as old as Nineve. Asdrum is—was—at least a couple thousand years old.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, making a mental note to follow up on. “And do you have any way of contacting Sage Asdrum?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sadly, no,” Vestele said. “I’m not even sure why I mentioned it. It’s no good just to know a name.” She let out a short, nervous laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm, no, it might still help,” Zelda said thoughtfully. “I sent an envoy to treat with them—any in their tribes who are still willing to talk with us Hylians. If nothing else, it gives us another avenue of inquiry. If they aren’t moved by my concerns, then perhaps Asdrum or his descendants may be willing to treat with the Order of Sages on official business. They do seem rather beholden to such arrangements.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry—what are you concerned about, exactly?” Vestele asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Just uh… attempting to keep more fragments out of the hands of the enemy, for as long as we can. There’s so very little we know for certain, but we do know they’re after the fragments.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm,” Vestele said. “I suppose that does seem wise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shifted uncomfortably. She was having difficulty reading Vestele. She noticed her food sat mostly untouched.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“More tea?” Zelda offered. “Wine? …Something stronger?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele smirked. “No, thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Idly, Zelda poured herself a cup of tea—trying to ignore the fact that it had long since gone cold. She took a sip, carefully avoiding Vestele’s eye. How best to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother’s Mercy—I can see there’s something on your mind, Zelda,” Vestele said. “Just spit it out. The sooner you speak it the sooner we can move on. We both have many other matters to attend to, yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda winced. She wasn’t particularly eager to bring the next topic up, but she did need to know. Who better to ask than Vestele?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve been thinking about what you told me, about Fae and Sacrifice. Do you know anything more about them? Specifically, about how people used to appease them, and what boons they granted in exchange?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Vestele said flatly. “Aside from more anecdotes and stories, I’ve told you all there is to know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know it may not seem like it,” Zelda tried, “but even anecdotes and stories may still prove useful. Are you sure? Even if it’s just stories—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Why, Zelda?” Vestele said forcefully. “Why this? Why Fae? I know this may come as a shock, but some questions are, in fact, best left unanswered.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated. “Well…” she said, tapping her fingers on the table. “I was meaning to tell you sooner, but Shesan seems to believe that my actions at the temple…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked up. The High Priestess glared at her intently.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your actions at the temple…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…May have set Fae loose on the world again,” Zelda finished sheepishly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele groaned. “And how does Shesan know this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She won’t tell me,” Zelda said. “That’s the thing about her. She’s rather stingy about what she’s willing to divulge—she says she’ll only answer specific questions, and then only if she believes there’s a reason for us to know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shook her head. “What kind of…” she waved a hand. “Nevermind. It’s not important. All the more reason to meet with her myself. The sooner the better; we may need to get the Seekers involved.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right. Exactly,” Zelda said, feeling rather ashamed she hadn’t thought of that herself. She found herself idly tapping again at the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele eyed her. “Whatever you’re thinking, don’t,” she said. “Fae are bad news. Our ancestors were exceedingly thorough, and very motivated. One does not expend the resources of a kingdom creating a secret order to eradicate all mentions of a thing on a whim. Surely you understand that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cleared her throat. “I’m not…” She shifted in her seat. “I’m worried it’s already being used against us,” she said. “Sacrificial magic, I mean. That’s most of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. Zelda sensed an opportunity, and went for it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If Fae are as dangerous as you suggest, then surely the enemy would think to use them against us? I haven’t even told you about my dreams yet. Nothing certain—there never is—but a recurring one shows me a circle of Blin in a grassy field performing a ritual. Maybe that’s connected somehow?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know what to tell you,” Vestle said irritably. “Your guess is as good as mine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I was thinking about capturing some of them, actually,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele stared at her blankly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…I mean, if they are performing sacrificial rituals to Demise… maybe Fi could help us understand it? There’s so much more to her Old Magic than even she’s aware of. We’re only scratching the surface of what’s possible! But most of it is truly dangerous; the most powerful expressions of it involve manipulating spiritual essences. If nothing else, just getting her to experiment on some Blin in captivity might—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No,” Vestele said, gesturing firmly. “Absolutely not. Have you lost your mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re just Blin!” Zelda said. “Do you believe those monsters deserve any clemency?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whatever you’re planning, I will have none of it,” Vestele said. “I’m serious. Leave me out of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vestele…” Zelda said, trying desperately to salvage the situation. “Look, I understand your concerns, but this isn’t even about Fae. I’m just suggesting a path towards exploring more of Fi’s own abilities. Fi! The Emissary of the Holy Mother! And besides, you know so much that I don’t. I’d really rather you work with me on this. Your knowledge—and the Sages too—could prove invaluable.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And all that earlier, about not co-opting the Faith and listening to my counsel? Are those just words to you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No! That’s not… that’s not what I meant!” Zelda said, deflating. “I would never… it’s just… I wouldn’t even be considering this if I didn’t think it was necessary! This <i>thing</i> we face… you know how dire—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Stop! Just stop,” Vestele let out a huff, covering her face. “Fine. Whatever. If it means potentially averting further catastrophe, I’ll do what’s necessary.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mother Above, this was <i>not</i> going as planned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a moment to compose a more thoughtful response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vestele, this isn’t what you think it is,” she said finally. “It doesn’t have to be like this between us. I’m not here to bully you or manipulate you into place. Whatever you’ve come to expect, that’s not me. I’m just trying to figure out what to do next. If you really object that strongly—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, you’re right,” Vestele said, standing. “Desperate times, and all that. I can’t be so selfish as to refuse to sully my own hands.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda resisted the urge to smack herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If that’s all, Your Grace, I have wounded soldiers to bless, grieving windows to console, and orphaned children to attend to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rose to meet her. She bowed graciously. “Thank you for meeting with me today. I am so sorry to have wasted so much of your time. I sincerely thank you for your wise counsel, and…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The High Priestess turned to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>That could have gone better.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A slow creak as the door opened and Taetus stepped into the private quarters that Zelda had appropriated for their meeting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith met him at the door and gestured to the empty seat in front of the table where Zelda sat. Taetus nodded to her and made his way over. Zelda sat confidently and upright as he approached, doing her best not to betray what she actually felt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Anger. Sickness. Loathing. Anxiety—and even a little fear, if she was being honest with herself. Why couldn’t he just be a normal, nice person, without any ulterior motives?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus bowed low as he reached the table. Zelda nodded in acknowledgement, motioning for him to take the empty seat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Before I say anything, Your Grace, I would like your assurance that I won’t be harmed, regardless of anything that may come of this meeting.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why?” Zelda said suspiciously. “Do you have something you don’t want me to know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Assurances first.” Taetus met and held her gaze. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“…And if I were to say no?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus shrugged. “If I anticipated you would say no, Your Grace, then I would find myself in a rather precarious position, would I not? Why, agreeing to meet with you under such circumstances without taking reasonable precautions would be sheer, reckless folly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Reasonable. Precautions,” Zelda said slowly. He was <i>not</i> implying what she thought he was implying. Even he wouldn’t dare…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, <i>hypothetically</i>,” Taetus said, drawing out the word and letting a long silence hang in its wake. “Hypothetically, a man put in such a position would be highly motivated to take extraordinary action to ensure his own safety. Action, such as arranging for mountains of damning evidence to be released to the public, unless said man were unharmed and set free by the end of said meeting. Evidence such as the illegal capture, torture, magical experimentation, and murder of Castletown’s citizens? Or perhaps just sordid and private details pertaining to one’s deviant sexual proclivities? The mind runs wild with ideas.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All the color drained from Zelda’s face as the bottom fell from her stomach. “You… you…” She shook her head in shock and utter disbelief. “…Taetus, you arrogant shit! You have the <i>audacity</i> to come in here and threaten me with—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Oh, never did I ever say I would do such a horrible thing, Your Grace! We’re only speaking in the hypothetical here, remember? Indeed; that sort of situation could only ever arise if, hypothetically, a man in my position truly believed a woman in yours would not be willing to give him the simple assurance that he would not be harmed as a result of what is, essentially, a business meeting.” He gave a short laugh. “But no; surely, Your Grace? Surely you think more of me than that? You are, after all, a kind, loving, and magnanimous Queen who would <i>never</i> threaten the life of her humble, loyal servants. Aren’t you? Or am I wrong on that count?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All the while he spoke, he held her gaze fixedly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was Zelda who broke first.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not going to kill you, Taetus,” she said softly, looking away. “…And I regret our previous exchange. I was angry, and bitter, and desperate to…” She sighed. “You didn’t deserve to be threatened like that. You’ve done a fine job, and despite disagreeing with your methods I can’t argue with your results.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She summoned up the courage to meet his eye again. Was she just imagining it, or did he seem more at ease?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As I said before,” she went on. “Whatever you’ve done—whatever you’re planning—it doesn’t matter. We have bigger issues to contend with now, and like it or not I have no choice but to work with you. Even if you did deserve death, you’re far too useful to let your talents go to waste.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed,” Taetus said curtly. “It’s been an absolute pleasure to serve, Your Grace, and I am so very thrilled that you are satisfied by my work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, I believe Taetus is attempting to mask his anger with sarcasm.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rolled her eyes. “Can we cut the shit?” she said. “Just tell me how you really feel—if nothing else so that we can clear the air and move on. As long as you’re truthful and don’t try to hide anything from me, you have nothing to fear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The counselor eyed her warily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I swear it in view of the Goddesses above,” Zelda said. “But you had better not speak a single word—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I would never think of it,” Taetus said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda crossed her arms. “Alright, then. Out with it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why do you hate me so?” he asked morosely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why do I—” Zelda shifted in her seat restlessly. “Don’t even get me started. You should <i>know</i>. All those years you played at being the concerned, dutiful advisor? Whispering in Father’s ear, reminding him at every turn how much I failed to live up to his expectations and leaving <i>me</i> to endure his judgement and ire? And then the very moment that he’s no longer around—when the responsibility of my kingdom and its future falls to me, <i>you</i> go behind my back. Sowing dissent within the Council. Sabotaging my projects. Undermining my efforts and taking every opportunity to grab more power for yourself! Lining your own pockets, all the while preaching about necessity and the good of the people! What more reason do I need to hate a man so vile and duplicitous as you? You turned <i>Amaurath</i> against me!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is that what you believe I’ve done?” Taetus said simply.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And there was that stupid, infuriating, smarmy grin of his. Zelda grit her teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I’m truly sorry for how—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Don’t even bother,” Zelda snapped.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Let him speak,</i> Laylith’s voice sounded in her mind. <i>He’s earned that much.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shot her a glance. Laylith shook her head minutely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda closed her eyes momentarily and pushed down the anger. She wasn’t in the most forgiving of moods, but she also knew it was important to keep in mind the reason for this meeting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Of course Laylith was right, as usual.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I apologize for interrupting,” Zelda said tersely. “You were saying?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>An uneasy tension hung in the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You misunderstand me, Your Grace,” Taetus said at last. “Never once have I ‘<i>sabotaged</i>’ your projects. If anything, I’ve done everything in my power to see them realized. You have astounding vision, but as ever you try too much too quickly and end up worse off than when you started. Merely imagining some great thing does precisely <i>nothing</i> to solve the myriad problems preventing its realization, and ignoring those problems does not make them go away. Promises of splendor and dreams of a great future buy only so much good will, and even your most ardent of supporters will start to question when the bills come due. Turn Sage Amaurath against you? No, Your Grace, it was <i>he</i> who came to <i>me</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her face, feeling thoroughly embarrassed. She hadn’t known that Amaurath… she had just assumed…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took a breath, composing herself. “By the Mother, but do you always have to be so dramatic? You could have just said.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus cleared his throat. “Apologies. Old habits.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I hear what you’re saying, but why couldn’t you have just told me that? Why couldn’t Amaurath? Why, with all the manipulation and trickery and subterfuge and two-faced dealings? I’m not daft, Taetus. Whatever you’ve come to believe, I am open to reason.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“With respect, Your Grace, His Holiness did try. Ardently. But not even Sage Amaurath had the gall to tell you, in no uncertain terms, that your efforts were bankrupting the kingdom. In fact, it took a great deal of maneuvering on my part just for him to feel comfortable in inviting me to that meeting. If I may speak frankly?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Already well past fatigued, Zelda motioned for him to continue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You inspire in your subjects both love and fear in equal measure. Your vision and your passion are matched only by your impetuousness and short temper. What’s more, you are quick to wield the authority of the Crown like a bludgeon when the gentlest reminder of your power is more than sufficient to keep your subordinates in line. You have every bit of your father’s temerity, yet not one iota of his poise and restraint.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pressed her lips together firmly as she looked to the far wall, doing her best to push past her annoyance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was absolutely not about to give him the satisfaction of being right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is that all?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Taetus said. “I’m done. Apologies, Your Grace, if I’ve overstepped, but it needed to be said.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No, by all means,</i> Zelda thought to herself. <i>Tell me something I don’t know. Tell me just how much I will never live up to his name.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She decided not to dwell. There was so much else to discuss. Best to move on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What do you want, Taetus?” Zelda said with a breath. “Be honest with me. No games. No misdirections. What is it you truly hope to accomplish?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus started with a grin, but only gave a nervous laugh. “Well… ah.” He scratched his chin. “In light of recent news, I believe ‘for the kingdom to survive’ certainly ranks at the top of the list. By a fair margin, at that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And after that? Presuming we survive?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shifted uneasily in his chair and adjusted his suit coat. “Your Grace, you must understand: Countess Oda hears the slightest bump and presumes a thief in the night!” More uneasy laughter. “I assure you, everything I have done has been in accordance with every letter of the law. I have no ill intent. Not towards you, nor towards the kingdom, nor—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I gave you my word that you would not be harmed,” Zelda said, losing patience. “Now, out with it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus sat still, looking to the floor. “I’ve been working with Nyllara Zan,” he said calmly. “Over the past… almost twenty years now, towards shifting the balance of power in the kingdom. The ultimate goal of our efforts being to all but eliminate any practical authority the Crown holds, and to greatly diminish the influence of the Noble Houses in politics. All the while maintaining the current structure of society and government. In our vision, the Crown continues to preside over the kingdom and the nobles still own everything, but in name only.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah,” Zelda said with a nod. “So you <i>are</i> a treasonous snake after all. Good to know I’ve been right about you all this time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A bead of sweat dripped down his face. “Ah—I would hardly call it <i>treason</i> to act wholly within the law to bring about systemic reform.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m joking,” Zelda said with a laugh. “That was a joke.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus looked to her, seeming rather confused.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I get it,” Zelda said. “You want power to reside in the hands of those most capable and most deserving of it, rather than whoever manages to pop out of a noblewoman’s twat first?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I—well… there’s a bit more nuance to it than that,” Taetus said uneasily. “But yes; more or less.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t get me wrong: it sounds reasonable enough,” Zelda said. “I myself have always taken the side of the Experimentalists versus Preservationism in academic debates. I mean, you’re the very embodiment of the argument for why commoners of sufficient merit should be allowed to hold higher offices. But then, one must also respect the argument from tradition. The histories are littered with accounts of rebellions and uprisings—of reforms and failed revolutions. Dozens, if not hundreds—every one of which resulted in a return to form, and sometimes then only at ruinous cost. Again, on the face of it, your view makes sense, and I could hardly fault you of all people for holding it. That is, if not for the historical precedent being so strongly in favor of the status quo.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…You’re not upset with me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goddesses—no,” Zelda said dismissively. “Annoyed, maybe, that it’s happened right under my nose. And I still hate you for all you’ve done to me, but you haven’t yet caused any permanent damage. At least, not that I’m aware of. …<i>Is</i> there more I should be aware of?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Taetus said, shaking his head vigorously. “Absolutely not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And all that about intercepting Lensa’s messages? That wasn’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve no idea what you’re talking about.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>He is sincere, Mistress.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good,” Zelda said. “I’m glad that’s settled.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She frowned. If that wasn’t him, then—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By the way, I too have read the histories, Your Grace,” Taetus offered. “I’d like to think I’m not a foolish man. I wouldn’t be attempting such unless I thought I could do better than our forebears.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother Above—you are ambitious, aren’t you?” Zelda had a good laugh at that. Not at him, so much as at the sheer absurdity of it all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Quite,” Taetus said dryly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To your credit, I suppose no one has tried yet to simply buy the kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled. That quip had earned her a reluctant grin from the Counselor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She felt oddly relieved. By the Goddesses, she still felt a passionate dislike for every hair on this man’s head—but as was usual with these things, coming to understand his motivations made him that much easier to deal with. In the space of a conversation, he had gone from a hated (potential) enemy to just someone she’d rather not deal with unless she had to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All the more reason, she supposed, to heed Laylith’s advice more often.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda noticed that he still looked rather uncomfortable. “Something on your mind?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Many things, Your Grace. I hardly know where to begin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Zelda said. “We have all night.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus raised an eyebrow apprehensively.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah—not like that,” Zelda said hastily. It was her turn to laugh uneasily. “Poor choice of words, that. No; I only mean to inform you: you will be accepting the mark of the Goddess Hylia. Fi will get started when you’re ready. Don’t worry; it won’t hurt and it won’t require anything on your part, other than several hours’ time. You won’t even notice a difference. I’ve arranged for you to sleep here while I quarter nearby. Fi assures me so long as I don’t venture too far, she can continue her work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Fi?” Taetus asked after a moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Emissary of the Goddess Hylia,” Zelda said. “Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ethereal entity manifested before them, hovering a few feet above the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus blinked a few times, then looked between the two of them. “Uhm… hrm,” he said, visibly gathering his bearings. “So the rumors are true, then? You truly are the Champion of Hylia?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In a manner of speaking,” Zelda said smugly. “And in a manner of speaking, you too will become her champion. Subordinate to me, of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And might I ask what the purpose or function of this ‘mark’ is?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked briefly to Laylith. She considered, then decided it was best to tell the truth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The mark will allow Fi to keep an eye on you for me. It will also reduce the cost of certain of her abilities when used on you—in particular Telepathy. Unlike Blue magic, hers will allow us to communicate and coordinate at great distances, and with little cost. Arlinkar was the second to be marked, after me. You will be the third.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… see,” Taetus said, rubbing his hands together idly. “That does sound quite useful. Quite useful indeed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi? Ready to get started?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative, Mistress,” Fi said, her chromatic form shifting colors. “I cannot begin unless Taetus expresses his consent.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda bit her lip. She would have preferred for Fi to have not said that aloud.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So… am I to presume that means I have a choice in this?” Taetus ventured warily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said, thinking quickly. “At least, not if you want to continue working with me, in whatever capacity we decide. It’s this and that, or nothing at all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus gave a resigned nod. “Very well. I suppose I consent to being named a champion of the Mother Goddess, and to bearing her mark. Truly: who in their right mind could refuse such an honor?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uh huh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, does that work?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Mistress,” Fi said with a pirouette. “I will begin at once.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With that, she faded into the aether.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, you were saying?” Zelda said, turning her attention back to Taetus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus shook his head, rubbing his temple. He shifted in his seat, suddenly looking very serious. “Your Grace, I must ask: what are your thoughts on Shesan’s proposal?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed, sinking into her seat. “I was hoping to ask you the same, Counselor.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I may?” Taetus offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. Go ahead,” Zelda said tiredly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you’re serious about this—serious about leaving me in charge of the kingdom while you continue your work against the enemy… then I have a counterproposal for you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda perked up. “I’m listening.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan is right,” he said, holding up a finger. “But only on one count. There are many among the high nobles—House Oda and the like—who will never accept me. Not as one of them, not as having any degree of power over them, and most certainly not as some sort of Consort-Regnant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What I propose is this: find some nobleman you trust, and wed <i>him</i>. Appoint him to a special office, grant him emergency powers—whatever works. Whatever you can safely manage for the time being. Then, privately, direct <i>him</i> to accede to <i>me</i> in all things. It is wholly unnecessary for me personally to be in the public light in that manner. Believe it or not, I would actually prefer it this way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In all things?” Zelda said dubiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem. I mean only to say…” he grinned, “I will work better and be more effective if I am not hindered by the, frankly, unnecessary oversight of one less capable of discharging the same duties you would have me be responsible for.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No?” he asked. “I only thought—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—We’ll see,” Zelda said, feeling not-at-all keen on discussing this particular topic with him. She rubbed her face. “For reasons you have intimated you know all too well, I’m not exactly excited at the prospect of marrying a nobleman.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about Arlinkar?” Taetus pressed, much to Zelda’s chagrin. “His own achievements notwithstanding, I believe his father was a merchant-lord, and his uncle was Captain of the City Guard? Not exactly the most orthodox of arrangements, but technically—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I <i>said</i> we shall see,” Zelda said hotly. She felt her face flush, and tried to hide it by looking away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My apologies, Your Grace. I did not intend offense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, don’t worry about it,” Zelda said, waving a hand. “I’ve had a rough day. Speaking of, I think it’s about time I retire. With luck, I can get some good rest tonight. We still have so very much to do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus rose to meet her and bowed deeply. Zelda wasn’t sure it was exactly the right thing to do, but she extended her hand. He shook it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll let you know when Fi’s done”, she said. “It likely won’t be before morning. I apologize for any inconvenience.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s no inconvenience, Your Grace,” Taetus said. “You humble me beyond words, and once again, I must thank you profusely for this opportunity. However we proceed, I will endeavor to prove to you that your trust in me is well-placed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started. Was he really…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shook her head, deciding to move on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She did her best to ignore Laylith’s smug look of “I told you so” on her way out.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda closed the door of the balcony behind her, sighing wistfully as she heard the satisfying click of the latch. Finally, a moment alone, with fresh air and a setting sun and nothing burning down around her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It had been a trying month, but things were finally looking up, both for Hyrule and for her personally. Taetus, as it turned out, wasn’t that bad after all. Link had secured not one but <i>three</i> fragments of Courage from Ibboso—who it turned out was quite amenable to a nice chat about ancient history, much to the delight of the Sages. The Blin were firmly routed, Wymar and his forces had retaken Talus, the Zora had returned home, and the kingdom was finally safe again and given a moment to breathe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Next came the hard work of cleaning up after the Blight, and of contesting Demise’s broader schemes. Monumental and important tasks to be sure, but those tasks were for tomorrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Starting today, Zelda was on vacation. She was going to sit out here in the light of the blood moon and read a thoroughly silly book about nothing in particular that had been gathering dust on her shelf since before the Blight. While doing so she was going to have some of her <i>special</i> tea, and then later she and Sera were going to take turns doing naughty things to each other with her favorite toys while Link watched.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda opened the cover of her book and-</span>
<br><br>
<span>She blinked, trying to focus as the words shifted and flowed over one another. Try as she might, the squiggles wouldn’t resolve in her mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked up. It was nighttime—wasn’t it just evening a moment ago? But, no, the sun was nowhere to be found in the sky, and the moon had gone red again. And she was in the middle of a grassy field, and there was a circle of blood drawn in the ground on the dirt, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Be you, no fear,” a thick, guttural voice spoke from behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The hair on the back of her neck stood up. Slowly, carefully, Zelda put her book down and stood, closing her eyes. She turned around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s just a dream,” she whispered to herself. “Just a dream. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She opened her eyes. A tall, scrawny Blin stood before her, wearing dusty grey robes. It was the ritualist from her dreams. Her breath caught, but she managed not to scream.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No dream,” the Blin said. It held up its hands. “No afraid. Be you, no fear,” he repeated slowly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you… have you been trying to communicate with me?” Zelda asked. “You’re telling me… not to be afraid? To have no fear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No fear! No fear!” The Blin nodded vigorously with a series of grunts and squeals. “I: Ildram, Sage,” he said. “Ildram, friend. You: Zelda, Queen. Zelda, mightiest of short-noses.” He pointed at himself, then to Zelda in turn. “Zelda: understand?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda giggled. Mightiest of… oh dear. Was she imagining it, or did he look worried?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it, Ildram?” she asked. “What is it you want to tell me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ildram, try again. Ildram, hold Wisdom. Zelda, hold Wisdom. Zelda, Ildram, same.” He made fists with both hands and touched them together. “Ildram speak, Zelda listen. Understand?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Ildram, I understand you!” Zelda said excitedly. “You’re trying to tell me that you and I both hold fragments of Wisdom, and that you can communicate with me through my dreams?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another series of grunts and squeals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This is great news, Ildram! With five fragments—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No! No speak! Zelda, no speak! No time! Ildram, speak. Zelda, listen! Zelda, understand?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, eyes wide.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ildram, sorry. Ildram, many sorry. Want, no war. Want, short-noses safe. Ildram, beg Zelda. Zelda, mightiest of short-noses. Zelda, tell short-noses. Say, go home. Short-noses, go home! Short-noses, no fight! Short-noses, no win!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ildram… I don’t understand,” Zelda said. “We’re winning the war. We’re not—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No!” Ildram bellowed. “No win!” He pointed to the sky above. “Moon of blood, darkness nears. Mokoblin bargains, Old-God hears! Mokoblin, hold Strength. Strength from Great one. Great one, hold greater Strength. Greater Strength from Old-God! Great one, force Mokoblin. Mokoblin, force Ildram. Old-God, force Ildram! Ildram, no want. Ildram, forced. Ildram, learn blood magic. Blood magic from Fish-God! Ildram, forced. Ildram, teach blood magic. Mokoblin, learn blood magic. Blood magic from Ildram! Moon of blood, darkness nears. Mokoblin bargains, Old-God hears!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Moon of blood…” Zelda whispered the words to herself as she looked up, at the blood-red moon in the sky. Dread and foreboding washed over her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ildram… what did the Mokoblin bargain for?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mokoblin bargains, Old-God hears!” Ildram repeated. “Mokoblin, give souls. Old-God, give weapons. Weapons made of souls! Moon of blood, darkness—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda jerked awake out of her chair, her cheek throbbing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There,” Shesan said, drawing back. “She’s awake.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith stood in the corner of the room, alternating concerned looks towards Zelda and glaring daggers at Shesan. Zelda looked around, seeing guards and physicians and even damnable Taetus standing around, all worried. What were they—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace!” a messenger towards the center of the room called to her, brushing past the others. She clutched a scroll in her hand in a death-grip, and had barely-suppressed panic in her eyes. “Your Grace!,” she repeated.“ Urgent news from the front—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Soulsteel,” Zelda said aloud.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room went quiet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How did you know?” the messenger asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My dreams…” Zelda whispered. The memories of her conversation with Ildram were still fresh in her mind. She shook her head. “It’s not important. Tell me, what news from the front?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The messenger collected herself. She stood straighter and focused her eyes on the wall above Zelda’s head as she spoke.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Direct from the Lord General, Your Grace. Message: Blin pressing attack, cannot halt advance. Blin wielding new weapons. Reports of soulsteel: swords that cut through men and armor with ease. Wounded are paralyzed barring extreme Healing; most die, few exceptions. Weapons disappear when Blin die. Bloodrage universal. Morale poor, supplies abandoned. In full retreat. Require direction and immediate assistance. Details enclosed,” here the woman held out the scroll in her hands. “End message.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman slumped and, in a break from decorum that raised several eyebrows, fell to her knees and addressed Zelda directly. “Your Grace… please,” she said. “I saw you at the siege, bathed in Hylia’s light. The end is come and we need the Mother’s protection again! Please, Your Grace! Please, help us!”</span>
<br><br>
