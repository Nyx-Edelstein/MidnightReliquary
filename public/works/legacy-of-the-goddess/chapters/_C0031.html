<span>Scrying with the Triforce fragments wasn’t the same as with Blue magic. With Blue magic there was a whole-body sensation of being displaced—unanchored and falling through the sky as one looked down from the heavens. With the golden power however, one simply needed to meditate with the intention of invoking that power, using the fragments as a focus. It was intuitive and easy, and required no training. Or rather, Zelda never required any training—and she didn’t have any other points of data to compare to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As expected, the ability the fourth fragment bestowed—to Scry at will any location she had recently visited—was substantially similar to the ability a single fragment bestowed: that of being able to Scry the location of “closely bonded individuals.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Neither she nor anyone else knew for certain what constituted a “close bond,” but for her that had only ever meant Impa. Not that she hadn’t tried to forge closer bonds—growing up, it hadn’t worked with Father, Lensa, Sage Amaurath, nor with any of her extended family. “Friends” her age were right out; finding anyone at all that treated her as an actual person was an exercise in futility itself. More recently, it hadn’t worked with Anli, nor Sera. Not even Link after the debacle with Ibboso, even though Zelda cared deeply about his well being and viewed him as a close and respected friend. It certainly hadn’t worked with Laylith either, despite the fact that Zelda had come to trust her with her most intimate thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No, it had only ever been Impa. That only made sense, she supposed. Impa had been everything to her. Impa had been… the older sister she never had. She had been Zelda’s closest friend. Her only <i>true</i> friend.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I miss you so much,” Zelda whispered. “I wish the world were different. I wish you could still be here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She clutched the tattered remnant of Impa’s shawl tight to her chest and took a long, slow breath, then dried her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>When had she last used the telepathic ability that three fragments granted? It was none other than that fateful day, back during the first siege, when she called Impa to the infirmary after being attacked by Vesyrn. And Scrying? Much, much earlier. Years ago, she had gotten Impa into trouble by Scrying into a top secret meeting, and later unintentionally leaking confidential information that she could have only learned from Impa. Impa never said anything about it to her, but Zelda felt miserable all the same. After that incident, she resolved never to betray Impa’s trust like that again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Goddesses, it wasn’t even that useful of an ability! She had never <i>needed</i> to know what was happening in Impa’s immediate vicinity at any point in time. She supposed those abilities might confer a slight tactical advantage or something of that nature, but that was of no use to her, and even if it was, those abilities weren’t anywhere near the level of being able to relive critical moments in time with knowledge of the future or granting brute, supernatural strength and magical prowess.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What was up with that, anyway? It seemed unfair. Four fragments, and the most useful ability she had was occasionally getting confusing, albeit prophetic dreams. She wondered if there was something to the fragments of Wisdom they were missing?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sighed, brushing the thoughts away and returning to the present moment. Earlier in the day, she had toured around the castle and the grounds outside. As she sat now with her mind clear and eyes closed, she walked back through her steps, seeing clearly in her mind’s eye all the places she had been. There was no sensation of movement; she simply decided what she wanted to see, and then images appeared in her mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Two guards stood watch outside the room, as others patrolled the castle corridors. More at the front gate—around a dozen. Some on the walkways of the gardens outside. A groundskeeper tended to the hedges, and a pair of maids carried out baskets of freshly laundered linens to dry. Back inside, through the kitchen, across a hall, and into a storeroom, a couple were engaged in… private affairs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head and blinked, awareness of her bedroom flooding her senses. She focused on the quiet rumbling of the hearth and the sweet smell of incense, clearing her mind and pushing her attention elsewhere.</span>
<br><br>
<span>How far back could she go? She could see into the streets of the city clearly—carts traveling to and fro and people going about their day, though nowhere as busy as she was accustomed to seeing. The windows of many shops and houses were still boarded up. It had been nearly two weeks—how many refugees had yet to return?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She followed the path she and her retinue took on the way in the evening prior, leading back to the stables. There, she watched an argument unfold between two individuals—presumably a customer and a stable boy. Nothing too interesting. She traced her route back further, to the city gates and the fields beyond. Nothing eventful there, either. Gently undulating hills. Tall grass swaying in the wind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her vision grew cloudier and it took more focus the further she went, until trying past a point gave her a headache that forced her to stop. It was about the point they had been this time yesterday, on the way back to Castletown.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded to herself, jotting notes. “Recently visited,” it seemed, meant about a day.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. This ability was certainly more useful than the others. For one, it required no expenditure of magic, and could be done at will without the unpleasant sensations that came with Blue Scrying. For another, it could be used indoors or outdoors, which made it strictly superior to the Blue variant. As far as she knew, it was undetectable. Given that she had visited a location, she could then spy upon those present there regardless of the usual precautions, such as sitting under a parasol or only speaking indoors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Suddenly, Shesan’s paranoia regarding informational security made a little more sense. Did the enemy possess abilities similar to this? She shuddered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Useful, sure. Still, not nearly as useful as getting the chance to rewrite time after dying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh well. Perhaps the abilities granted by the two additional fragments on their way to her would prove more advantageous. Only time would tell.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda knocked on the door to Shesan’s quarters.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enter,” the woman called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda did so, stepping inside and pulling the door closed behind her. “Shesan? A moment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Urgent?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm,” Shesan muttered. She marked and set aside the book in her left hand, laid her quill across the parchment in front of her, crossed her arms and legs, and looked up at Zelda from her desk. </span>
<br><br>
<span><i>That’s okay. Don’t bother greeting me in my own castle or anything.</i> “…Mind if I sit?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan inclined her head and motioned to the chairs in front of her desk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve been thinking,” Zelda said as she took a seat. She used the opportunity to steal a glance at Shesan’s notes. Of course, they were written in a cipher she had never seen before. “I’ve done some experiments involving Scrying and Foretelling recently, using Foretelling as a means to reduce the area and resultant time necessary to Scry in search of an object or person. My notes, if you prefer to read them.” She offered up a notebook, copied from her most recent journal entries.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded along, took the notebook when offered, and scanned through. “And?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You never explained how it was you helped find the Warlord,” Zelda said. “I was wondering if any of this could be used in conjunction with your magic—perhaps as a means to Scry directly for fragments of the Triforce? Or other locations in my dreams.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mm, I see,” Shesan said, reclining in her seat. She paused to glance up at the ceiling, then snapped the book closed and handed it back. “Not a bad idea, but no, it won’t work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Color me surprised,</i> Zelda thought to herself. “And why is that?” she asked. She locked eyes with the woman.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan smirked. “The ‘scrying’ I used then was an ancillary feature of a minor divination, with no relation to your variant of Scrying. In essence, I was able to exploit the fact that the Warlord had a uniquely stronger connection to Ja’bu and to… <i>Demise</i>, than did any of his lackies.” Palpable disdain as she said the name. “By leveraging that connection, I found the direction in which there was least resistance. —Not <i>physical</i> direction mind you, more… metaphysical. But it mapped cleanly enough to physical space given the arrangement of Blin camps around the city.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda furrowed her brow and tapped her chin as she processed the information. “So you’re saying your magic is incompatible with Foretelling, or…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The particular trick I used is already delicate and sensitive enough. Additional layers of ritual and distraction would make it all the more difficult to glean any useful information in this manner.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said, not entirely convinced. She narrowed her eyes. “So you can contact void entities?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In a manner of speaking, yes,” she affirmed, to Zelda’s surprise. “But it’s a two-way connection. Establishing it alerts them to my presence and gives them information about me and my intentions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Which is why you only suggested it as a last resort.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Precisely.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “I see, I see.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She could almost feel the weight of Shesan’s scrutiny. It made it hard to think. She held up a hand and turned her head, gathering her thoughts. “…So, could this ability be used to contact Fae?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have absolutely no intentions of contacting any Fae,” Shesan said flatly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then is it something I could do? Through Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… yes? I think so. In principle—I’m not aware of anything that would stop you. But <i>why</i>, Zelda? Surely you recognize how dangerous they are? Trying to make direct contact with one could put us all at risk.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do recognize the danger, yes,” Zelda said, keeping a lid on her irritation. “But we may not have much of a choice. I’ve been thinking about it, and Ryn—one of Link’s teammates? May have already come under the influence of one following their recent misadventure.” She held up a finger, preempting any objection. “New information, and again, nothing urgent. At least, I don’t think so. It came to me just this morning from Link, via Fi. I was intending to bring it up at the meeting later today.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In that case…” Shesan sighed, massaged her temple, and relaxed into her chair. “Okay. Tell me everything. We’ll see what we can do.” </span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda ordered her guard to stand watch outside after making an excuse to duck into her study. She checked the clock. About forty minutes before the meeting. She hurried upstairs and into her private office, pulling the door shut.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took a seat on the floor, crossing her legs and pressing her back up against the wall. Closing her eyes, she bid her vision to return to the conversation with Shesan earlier, in her private quarters.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scoffed in disbelief. “Really?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room had been emptied and cleaned, and was devoid of any personal effects.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She huffed again under her breath and shook her head. <i>Unbelievable.</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda entered the meeting hall, her Sheikah retainers falling into guard positions by the door. For once, she was not the last to arrive. She took a seat at the head of the table with Laylith at her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Everyone here?” Zelda asked. “Who are we waiting on?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A knock at the doors. They swung open to reveal Malg, followed by Chalia of the Order of Sages. “Apologies, Your Grace,” Chalia said. “I only just received your summons.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda glanced briefly around the room. Shesan met her eyes as she turned from the window. She winked, strode over to the table, and took a seat across from Semmes, between Nyllara Zan and Neri Eseret.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Suspicion and mistrust, as always. Come on, Zelda, <i>think</i>. Why would I ask her here after we just discussed—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—And there it was. A glimmer of understanding, followed by a flash of worry. Yes, you should be worried. Took you long enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No worries, Sage Chalia,” Zelda said. “And thank you for joining us on such short notice. We’re only just getting started.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg, ever in keeping up the charade of refined civility, pulled out a chair for the youngest Sage before taking his own seat next to Wymar Letholdus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright everyone,” Zelda began, stacking her notes. “We’re trying something different today. We have Arlinkar, Izu, and Vesyrn’s teams in contact with us remotely from Hylia’s Watch, via Fi. Fi will maintain a presence there, relaying our words to them, and will telepathically communicate anything they have to say to me directly.” She paused to scan the table. “Also: let’s get updates from everyone before we discuss solutions and next steps. I want to make sure we aren’t missing anything. Sound good? Okay. First order of business… Chancellor Taetus?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nodded and stood, hands folded behind his back. “Your Grace, it is with solemn remorse that I report that we have recently quelled an armed rebellion in the Westlake region. The rebellion arose in response to the enforcement crackdown of our treaties with the Zora regarding restrictions on fishing. Two of the leaders were executed for sedition, and the rest of the organizers were conscripted into military service.” A pause as he hung his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There have been a number of less serious issues of public order throughout the realm; none rising to the level of concern for the Crown. In general, tensions with the Zora remain high, morale among the populace low, and I expect there to be additional incidents in the coming weeks as food becomes more scarce ahead of this year’s harvests.” He cleared his throat. “I wish to state for the record: these issues <i>are</i> being handled and mitigation plans are in place. I have every confidence we will endure. I am only mentioning this now because of the gravity of the situation and the fact that addressing these issues has taken up so much of my time and effort. Truly, I must commend Counselor Semmes on rising to the occasion and assuming responsibilities as acting Head of the House of Commons. Without him, I doubt I would have even a moment’s rest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>In short: I’m too busy holding your kingdom together to be your errand boy too, Your Most Highness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan clapped softly with the rest of the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned as Taetus returned to his seat. “Very understandable, Chancellor. I must thank you again for your unwavering service and commitment to the kingdom. …So I take this to mean you have not made progress with testing Old Magic on Blin?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Regrettably, no, Your Grace,” Taetus answered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Understandable,” Zelda said. “Thank you for your report. Counselor Semmes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” Semmes said, standing. “Chiefly, Castletown faces growing issues stemming from refugees not returning to the city as expected. After the second evacuation in two seasons, the general sentiment is that the city is ‘unsafe for habitation.’” He glanced to Taetus, presumably for moral support. Taetus nodded. “A fair number of those who have returned have already left, or are making plans to leave, citing unlivable conditions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unlivable conditions?” Zelda asked. “How bad can it be? I’ve… been out there recently. This is news to me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe most of that sentiment stems from floods in the Raspel, Bellane, and Lower Court districts following the recent heavy rains. We’ve determined the cause to be malfunctioning sluice gates due to lack of maintenance. Repairs are underway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised an eyebrow. “And whose job is it to oversee maintenance?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus briefly opened his mouth to speak. “Ultimately mine, Your Grace,” Semmes interjected. “I make no excuses, and take full responsibility.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well-orchestrated. She couldn’t argue with either of them without either accepting responsibility herself or seeming unfair and unjust.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded with a sigh. “It is, again, understandable, given the situation. Still, we cannot afford many more such missteps.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, Your Grace,” Semmes said with a bow. “I will redouble my efforts.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Counselor,” Zelda said. “Please proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan ran a finger along her eyebrow as she stared at a random spot on the table. The pomp and circumstance never ceased to grate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Adding to the general unwillingness of the citizenry to remain, there are rumors of children disappearing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry—what?” Zelda blurted out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Semmes balked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My Justicars have thoroughly investigated the matter, Your Grace,” Taetus said. “We are confident: they are nothing more than unsubstantiated rumors. They are persistent rumors, nonetheless. I suspect intentional sabotage.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“From who? Spies?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unlikely,” Taetus said. He paused, raising a balled fist to his chin. “We will continue investigations, but there is as of yet insufficient evidence to warrant accusations, much less make any definitive statement.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unofficially, then,” Zelda said. “Who do you suspect?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus shifted uncomfortably.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, for the love of all that is precious— “Countess Lensa Oda,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gasps. Murmurs. Oh dear. The impropriety. The intrigue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And <i>why</i> should we suspect Lensa?” Zelda asked harshly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because it’s—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—The pattern does fit, Your Grace,” Taetus said with his signature smirk. “Too neatly, I might add. I believe many of the refugees are not returning in large part due to coordinated efforts between House Oda and a smattering of other noble houses who have rallied to her banner. Oda, Nen, Lotan, and Garek have all instituted permissive policies of sharecropping to migrant workers, and have made their food stores available to the general public taking refuge on their lands.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t sound so bad?” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. Frankly, it’s genius,” Taetus answered. “It’s unsustainable in the long term, but for the time being they’re forestalling famine while denying Castletown direct income from trade, taxes, and tariffs, thus weakening our position politically—no doubt intending to force concessions. And at the current rate, we may have no choice but to concede.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Politics?” Zelda said with a huff. “Now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I wish it were not so, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was unfortunately a problem endemic to many peoples. To their credit, the Hylians fared better than average on that count: it had been months since the invasion, and not a single political assassination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head. “I don’t understand—what connection do the rumors have to Lensa? Why do we not suspect the spies?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg spoke up. “Your Grace, we are absolutely certain no spies remain within Castletown, nor within the Royal Province.” Absolutely certain, you say? Shesan rolled her eyes. “We have captured and interrogated another two Yiga, and the accounts of active cell members and their activities all corroborate. Twelve total—ten killed or executed, and two on the run. Last seen fleeing to the mountains in the northwest.” He paused to stroke the stubble on his chin. “Besides. If it were enemy agents, why spread rumors of missing children rather than actually abducting children?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It said volumes about the man that that’s where his thoughts went first.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus inclined his head and raised an eyebrow. “He does have a point, Your Grace. And to my knowledge, no other party has a motive. But I must reiterate: officially, we do not have sufficient evidence for any formal charges, and it is unlikely that we will find any. They are, after all, only rumors.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said, looking pale. She rested her head in her hands, no doubt deep in thought about how to navigate the politics without playing directly into Lensa’s hands or making matters worse. If only someone had foreseen this eventuality and provided her with a clever and costless solution to sidestep the petty drama before it happened. Alas.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Chancellor Nyllara: From a legal standpoint, can anything be done?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am uncertain what you are asking, Your Grace?” Nyllara said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is there any legal basis for the Crown to enjoin the errant Noble Houses from exercising these sharecropping policies, or whatever else they’re doing to keep people away?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, wow. That she had to ask implied there likely wasn’t. They had laws like that here? <i>Interesting.</i> That showed a surprising degree of forethought and cultural sophistication. And weren’t most of their legal traditions inherited from Farwatch and Byrna? Yet more evidence for the collapse theory. Indirect evidence. Still, evidence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is unlikely, Your Grace,” Nyllara answered after a short pause. “The Feudal Sovereignty Act of 293 clearly establishes the right of high nobles in good standing to administer their lands without interference from the Crown or Provincial Governors, excepting matters of public welfare and state security.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Countess knows the law as well as anyone,” Taetus added. “No doubt she has arranged matters precisely to bolster the argument that she and the others are acting on behalf of public welfare, and not against it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nervously tapped the table. “What if House Oda were not in good standing?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Palpable tension.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That is a serious charge,” Nyllara said. “Is this merely a <i>hypothetical</i>, or…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her face. “Let’s table the matter for now and move on. Anything else, Taetus? Semmes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Your Grace.” / “No, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. Thank you Chancellors. Counselor. Sir Malg.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nods around the table. Shesan quelled the urge to say “you’re welcome.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lord General?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” Wymar said with a salute as he stood. “I will keep it brief. The Soulsteel Blin continue to provide formidable resistance, but I am pleased to report that the horde is all but shattered and leaderless. As of this morning, High Captain Averil, in command of the main army, has begun the siege of Talus Outpost, and our auxiliary forces have moved to stem ingress from the Talus, Eastwyrd, and Faron passes. Talus Outpost will be under our control again within a matter of days, and I expect the region to be fully secured within the fortnight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan stood and clapped with the others, lest she stick out like a sore thumb. All cultures were unique, she supposed, even ones that made it a point to celebrate early and often while the end of the world loomed over them. Whatever it took to keep them motivated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar nodded graciously and waited for the room to quiet. “To conclude: I have returned to Castletown to coordinate with High Captain Neri, who will oversee the cleanup effort, and have instructed my staff to provide a report of the final damage toll by the end of Last Flows.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Lord General, for your exemplary command. All of Hyrule is in your debt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another round of applause. Really?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem,” Zelda continued. “Which brings us to the next order of business.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Plan alpha,</i> Shesan communicated telepathically to Vesyrn.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Acknowledged,</i> came the response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you all know, Champion Arlinkar and Champion Izu are, on my orders, traveling to the Lightsworn temples. We have it on good authority that one of the temples lies on the western bank of the River Hylia, south of Hylia’s Watch. Exploring that location is their current mission. Assuming no issues arise… I have obtained direct confirmation that another temple lies at the heart of the Zora’s Domain. Ideally, they would continue on to the next temple after completing their current mission.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>In position.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The scene at Hylia’s Watch, over two-hundred kilometers away, unfolded in Shesan’s mind. Ten shadowy silhouettes (and one golden one) enveloping multifaceted burning embers stood in a loose grouping, arrayed in a semicircle around the void construct. She flared her Shadowsight to pierce the veil between the Void and the physical realm, and details cohered around the locus of her vision. Vesyrn stood propped against the wall with his arms folded, just behind the girl Ryn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No connection—not an active one, anyway. Which made sense. Otherwise, the construct likely would have detected it by now.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>However…</i> Zelda paused to glance at Shesan. It was an odd sensation, hearing Zelda’s words in person and echoing a moment later in her mind. <i>My recent dreams may be cause for concern. In one, I saw Link and the others in a boat, rowing into misty waters. As they entered the fog, hands from below the surface sprung up to grab them and drag them under.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Murmurs and chattering at Hylia’s watch. Shesan’s awareness snapped back to the meeting hall. “When was this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Two days ago.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded. The likely meaning was straightforward enough—though one hardly needed prophetic dreams to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Though I suppose I don’t need my dreams to tell me that sending them into the heart of corrupted Zora territory with Ja’bu alert to their presence would be folly,” Zelda said, taking the words right out of her mouth. She turned to address the others present. “I spoke recently with Golvara—a prominent and influential figure in Zora culture—and suggested to him the possibility of a joint diversionary strike to open a window for infiltration. He believed it might be feasible, but costly. ‘Bloodshed and death by the thousands’ were his words. General Wymar, what are your thoughts?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan split her attention, keeping a thread of concentration on Ryn for any signs of activity. <i>Alpha four,</i> she transmitted.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Acknowledged.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The general pinched the bridge of his nose as he shook his head. “Your Grace—into the heart of the Domain? Suicide. Nevermind the terrain—fighting Zora in the open waters? They’d be able to withstand an assault of ten… twenty times their numbers, easily. We’d be throwing men into the grinder. Under normal circumstances, I would never sign off on such an order.” A long, drawn-out breath. “If it’s absolutely necessary in defense of the realm, a <i>diversionary</i> strike may be possible. But let me be clear: we stand zero chance of achieving any long-term strategic objectives. From the assault, anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And exfiltration?” Shesan prodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar wordlessly shook his head as he extended an open palm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly as she sank into her seat. “Thank you for your honest counsel. We’d be betting a great deal, yes. But for all we know, the key to defeating Ja’bu may be at the temple. Or more ancient weapons like the transfabrulator, or additional fragments, or lost knowledge from thousands of years ago. Who knows what they’ll find?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We still have other options,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We do,” Zelda agreed. “And for the sake of being thorough, this is one of them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan gave a noncommittal shrug. If Zelda decided to press the issue, she could be more forceful in her objection. Given time, the girl usually came around to reason. Usually.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any other dreams lately?” Shesan asked. She raised a hand as the thought came to her— “And for the record, let it be noted your dream foretelling the doom of Arlinkar and his team came <i>after</i> the meeting with Golvara.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda clenched her jaw. “I was getting to that. As a matter of fact, I did have another dream last night. In it, all the water in Hyrule dried up and people died en-masse from a drought.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why didn’t these damnable dreams come with an instruction manual? That could mean almost anything.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm. Do we know what that one means, Your Grace?” Chalia.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Sage. As is often the case with my dreams, their relevance is usually only understood in hindsight. There have been a few exceptions, but most of the portentous ones are like this. I do believe many of my dreams involving water have, unsurprisingly, referred to potential conflicts with the Zora or consequences of Ja’bu’s influence in some capacity. Perhaps this one does too? …I was actually hoping to ask if you had any ideas.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, hmm, well then,” Sage Chalia said, shifting back in her seat and crossing her legs. “In that case…” She thought for a long moment, then shook her head. “Sorry, I’m really not the one to ask. Perhaps it’s warning us of—uh… an actual drought?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hah. Wouldn’t that be ironic?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How often do you have droughts here?” Shesan asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Rarely, though—” / “They’re not—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Apologies, Your Grace,” Chalia said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, go ahead,” Zelda said with a welcoming gesture.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia nodded. “It depends on the severity, I suppose. It happens every few years that we go weeks or—on the order of decades—most of Calm without rain. But Storms always brings—well, storms.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Always?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. Without exception in recorded history.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hm. Intriguing. A disturbance significant enough to disrupt a complex climate system stable over millennia…? Unlikely at this stage, but not wholly outside the realm of possibility.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Weren’t there droughts in the mesas?” Laylith. “I believe that was the main reason the Sunseekers sought to deal with us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, Naibi did say that,” Zelda said. “That’s… troubling. It was due to Geira’s curse or something, right? What if the droughts continue to move further north?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shook her head. “From what I gather, that’s most likely the natural climate of the region reasserting itself. It was Geira who made the area more hospitable, as part of her bargain with the Gerudo. When Ganondorf slew her avatar, those protections went with her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said, tapping her chin. A long pause. She met Shesan’s eyes. Shesan gave a subtle nod. “What about Fae, then?” Zelda asked. “They could cause a drought, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia sat forward, alert. “Why are we worried about Fae, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well…”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Finally.</i> If she hadn’t been looking for it at that exact moment, she would have missed it. A brief disturbance in the flickering ember that represented Ryn’s essence. Shesan flared her Shadowsight again, following the flow of Void Power to the source.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A flash of white light as she made contact and shifted into a pocket dimension on the conceptual plane.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A lone figure floated upon the firmament in a featureless landscape. Feminine, with long silver hair and fair skin that shone with a soft light. A mass of tangled vines covered its naked body, but only just.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What are your intentions here, Fae?” Shesan demanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Fae turned to face her. “You… are not of this world.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am not,” Shesan said. “And so you know I am not bound by its rules. I ask again: <i>what are your intentions</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Where do you come from, I wonder? Arlindal? Foeshroud?” The Fae grinned a mischievous grin. “…The Twilight?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The corner of Shesan’s mouth twitched. “Last chance. What—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am <i>Lucia,</i>” the Fae said, its voice rumbling through the sky as dark storm clouds pooled around them. Lightning and thunder and winds and rain whipped about, sending Shesan reeling with vertigo. She blanked her mind, willing the sensations to stop, but she could not—the Fae was too strong.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You should know better than to trifle with powers greater than you, little witch,” Lucia said. “Or don’t you know? Shadows flee before the <i>light!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The storm clouds broke, revealing the blinding light of a golden sun. Its scorching rays scoured her skin. Shesan shielded her eyes and took refuge in Lucia’s shadow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“See there?” Lucia said, with all the smugness of a capricious demigod. “I mean you no harm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That light is not yours, Fae,” Shesan said. “And I do not fear you.” She lashed out with a torrent of Void Power, wrapping coils of chromatic energy around the Fae’s wrists, solidified into metallic chains. The light of the sun faded and the storm clouds around them dispersed, leaving them back in a featureless dull-grey landscape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Fae laughed haughtily. “You think this can hold me for long?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not long, no,” Shesan said. “But long enough for me to bargain with you on equal footing.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Your Grace… even with Kellin there, I’m afraid it’s just too dangerous,” Sage Chalia said. “I’m certain the High Priestess will say the same. I’m sorry, but I must insist. As a Sage of the Order, I assert jurisdiction on this matter and request that the artifact be turned over to the Seekers immediately.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda closed her eyes and took a calming breath. Challenging the Faith directly would cause unending problems, but by the same token, Vestele couldn’t risk challenging the authority of the Crown either. They may well be forced to turn over the pendant, but no one could keep Zelda from being there when they inspected it. She’d have to play this carefully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Damnation. This was not going as planned. <i>Shesan, you had better have a good excuse, or so help me…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, Sage,” Zelda said. “We’ll make arrangements. But this discussion is not over.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sage Chalia opened her mouth to object, but stopped short, settling for a respectful nod.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan? …Shesan?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry,” Shesan said with a rapid blink of her eyes. “I was lost in thought. What’s the question?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda narrowed her eyes. It wasn’t like her to daydream in the middle of a meeting. Telepathy, perhaps? “Your report?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right. Uh. Can we adjourn for a moment, Your Grace? I need a moment to collect my bearings.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gawked, turning to Laylith and doing a double take. Laylith shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is… something the matter?” Counselor Semmes asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan stood and paced away, then stepped back to the table. “Actually, on second thought, I’m good to continue.” She wrapped her hands around the back of her chair and stared down at the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Okay then…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“As we all know,” Shesan said, “Vesyrn, Allanah, and Ahiran have made it back to Hylia’s Watch in possession of two fragments of Wisdom. Unfortunately, the rest of the team did not survive the encounter with the Byrna monks. On the upside: if they were to leave tomorrow morning, they could be here in four days. Vesyrn’s next mission has yet to be determined.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A slight interruption, if I may,” Taetus said, holding up a finger. Shesan made a yielding gesture. Taetus pursed his lips. “How to put this. Vesyrn’s public image is… problematic. Everyone, everywhere believes him to be a traitor.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A royal pardon then,” Zelda suggested. “Conditional on a public confession and apology. How’s that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus waggled his hand. “Depends on the specifics, Your Grace. We could make it work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well—whatever you suggest,” Zelda said. Vesyrn was too valuable not to make use of. She turned back to Shesan. “I assume Vesyrn is okay with this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan raised an eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah. Whoops.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress,</i> Fi’s voice echoed in her mind, <i>Vesyrn is willing to comply. He states his allegiance has always been to the kingdom.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Fi informs me that he is willing to do so, and further that he professes his allegiance has always been to the kingdom,” Zelda repeated. Not to the <i>Crown</i>, she noted. “That settles that.” She smiled. “Shesan? Please continue.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan blinked her eyes and shook her head minutely. “Naibi has had little luck dealing with the Gorons. Few will speak to her, and those that have are adamant that, seeing as she is an emissary of the Hylian Queen, they have no business with her until the Blood Oath is fulfilled.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Far less fruitful than Zelda had been hoping for. “Unfortunate. Should we recall her, then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am given to believe she intends to continue searching,” Shesan said. “Asdrum has to be somewhere.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. Shesan went on. “We’ve made some progress with the Lost Woods exploration. One of the researchers in my employ found that wetted face coverings prevented onset of the delirium, at least initially. They were able to map out a small section of the forest, but unfortunately one of them disappeared and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. The other two have resigned their posts and refuse to go back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Again, unfortunate.” Zelda cocked her head. “Wetted face coverings? Why would that help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have… theories,” Shesan said. Infuriating, as always. “I’ll draft up more plans and get back to you. We’ll need more researchers, though. I’m having difficulty finding replacements.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “I’ll see what we can do.” Come to think of it, where had Shesan gotten those researchers, anyway? And she had not been informed of any projects to explore the Lost Woods. Not explicitly, anyway. What else was Shesan up to? “…Any other projects we should know about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I was getting to that.” Shesan said with a cocksure grin. Zelda did her best to return an amiable smile. “As per our previous discussion, I’ve been working on a solution to get our agents to Farwatch. To that end, I commissioned a seaworthy vessel the moment I got word back from Vesyrn after sending him to investigate the area.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…A boat?” Why didn’t she think of that?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded. “Not just a boat. Steel plated, with removable inserts to simplify imbuing the armor, thus providing protection from magical attacks as well. It can comfortably house a hundred people and a year’s worth of food, though I anticipate we’ll only need a couple months at most. When the time comes, we can use it to navigate the Hylia River, through the Ruins of Byrna and around the coast. The only obstacles being—well, Lizalfos, corrupted Zora, and the warrior monks we pissed off in Byrna.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her face. Right, that. “Wymar? What do you think?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lord General shrugged. “I see no reason why we can’t find a hundred good men.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” Zelda said. “When can we expect completion of this boat?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yesterday,” Shesan said, smug. “We’ll need enough mages to imbue the plating before setting off, but besides that, construction is complete. The total price: one-hundred fifty thousand rupees. Or thereabouts. Still haggling over the finer details.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Semmes sputtered. Taetus set his head in his hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. She did not just—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda furrowed her brow and raised a finger. “Did you…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Relax, Zelda,” Shesan said. “I paid for it out of my own pocket.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gaped at her, as did half of the rest of the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “What? I told you I’ve been busy.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Shesan sat alone at the window of the meeting hall. Zelda approached her after calling for a recess, first making sure Sage Chalia was not in earshot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan, a word?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gave her an expectant look.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She bit down on her frustration. Or tried to, anyway. “<i>Chalia?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded. “As I said, I’d handle the Seekers.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>“By inviting a Sage to the meeting?!”</i> She made sure to keep her voice low.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan grinned. “Chalia is the easiest to influence. And when they inspect the pendant, they’ll find nothing. Vestele will appreciate your forthrightness and cooperation, and the situation will resolve itself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head in confusion. “I don’t understand. What about Lucia?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan leaned in and whispered quietly, speaking with <i>two</i> voices. “I look forward to working with you again, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After a short stroll to clear her mind, Zelda sat back at the table with the others, feeling equal parts excitement and dread. She folded her hands and pressed them flat against the table to mask her nervous jitters. Her mind was full of questions, but she had to see this meeting through before she could interrogate Lucia in private.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Deep breath. She cleared her throat, then turned her head slightly as she felt a reassuring pat on the shoulder from Laylith.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smirked and tried to keep from laughing out loud. Of course they thought her nerves were from the responsibility of managing an imploding kingdom. Hah. It felt like she had been doing that for ages.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Though, despite her best efforts to slip into a rousing, royal speech, her mind remained blank.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, everyone…” she said, as she searched for anything of substance to say rather than banal platitudes. “Overall: Stay the course. We’re stretched thin, and we have few options but to continue on and weather the storm. We need to keep in perspective that we are living through historical times, and we are doing the best we can with what we have.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Best to get someone else talking.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned to Taetus and paused as she pondered a passing thought. “Chancellor… yours is without a doubt one of the best minds our kingdom has to offer. It seems a waste to me then, for you to devote so much of your time to important, but mundane work. Vitally important work, of course, but I can’t help but wonder if we’re making the best use of your talents?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was she imagining it, or was he blushing?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem. You flatter me, Your Grace,” Taetus said. “Important work, yes—vitally important, absolutely. …What is it you are suggesting?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She tapped her chin. “Well, thus far the only thing keeping me from granting you more authority has been fear of backlash from the high nobles. If we’ve already crossed that threshold, I don’t see why we shouldn’t go all in.” She paused to let the words sink in. Taetus glanced furtively around the table, no doubt gauging the others’ reactions.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seeing as we’re continually on the verge of crisis and will be for the foreseeable future, I see no reason why you can’t make temporary, special appointments to delegate your responsibilities. Perhaps from Wymar’s staff as they are freed up, or from the other noble houses you’ve…”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>He froze up as she stopped just short of saying “got eating out of your hand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…maintained good relations with,” Zelda finished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nodded, slowly. “I am honored, Your Grace, and humbled by the Crown’s continued confidence in my leadership. But this is a… tight rope we walk. Never mind me exercising yet more authority on your behalf: playing favorites to this degree sends an unmistakable message to House Oda and the others. It will embolden the countess, and draw others to her cause.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Yes. And I’d like you to take personal charge over that matter as well. I don’t like this business with the child abduction rumors. And if I know Lensa at all—if indeed she is behind this—she won’t stop there. I want you to see if you can drag her out. Set a trap if you must. See if we can catch her in the act. What do you think?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus sat impassively for a short moment, before giving another slow nod. “As you say, Your Grace. It will be done.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned her attention to Wymar. “Lord General, your thoughts? Is this acceptable?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Absolutely, Your Grace,” Wymar said. “I have always known Chancellor Taetus to be a man of honor and diligence. It would be my pleasure to work with the Queen’s Justice to preserve the law and order of the realm in these trying times.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Excellent,” Zelda said. “Then it’s settled. Chancellor Taetus, you have my blessing. Now, on to other matters.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>One item down… how many more to go? Zelda checked her notes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah. Also, Wymar: I’d like you to go ahead with recruitment for the boat. Begin training soldiers on operating the vessel. The full complement, plus a few reserves, just in case.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly, Your Grace.” Wymar gestured to Neri, who nodded in turn and began taking notes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda glanced towards Shesan and her heart skipped a beat. Careful. Breathe. It’s still Shesan in there. Probably. Maybe. She shook her head, trying to put the thoughts from her mind. “Shesan, does the ship have cannons?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan raised a skeptical eyebrow. “No. Do we have reason to expect conflict with enemy vessels?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shrugged. “Who knows? If nothing else, it would be an intimidating display of power. Nothing like the thundering sound of a dozen cannons to strike fear into the hearts of our enemies.” She smiled. “Oh, and repeating crossbows. Can we mount some of those on the deck? Also, I have some designs for siege engines that use cranks and precision gearworks to reliably and accurately lob projectiles at range—boulders, cannon shells, bombs, or just burning bundles of pitch. Could we incorporate one or two of those, too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “Sure. I’ll see what I can do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perfect.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what of the diversionary strike plan?” Wymar asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head. “If you can spare the resources, I would appreciate an analysis of our options—preferably in collaboration with Zora military leadership. Otherwise, it’s not currently a priority.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>What else? Malg was doing an outstanding job rooting out the spies. Nothing actionable there. The Gorons and the Blood Oath? Hmm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’d like to reassign Allanah—once she has returned and had a chance to rest—to follow up on locating the Chieftain’s Hammer for the Gorons. Can we do that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I may, Your Grace?” High Captain Neri. </span>
<br><br>
<span>She didn’t like the sound of that. She could already guess what the woman was about to say. “Go ahead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Neri paged through her notes. “There are twenty-five active Sheikah—twenty-seven if we count Vesyrn and Allanah. Down from <i>thirty-eight</i> when last we updated the roster following the first siege.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, wow. She hadn’t realized how costly the Blight had been.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of those,” Neri continued, “three are assigned to Champion Arlinkar, two to Champion Izu, three as your personal guard…” She flipped a page. “Sir Malg is of course on special assignment. Four are tasked to compliment forces guarding the southern spans, five—just about every Blue Sheikah that can be spared—is on reconnaissance, tracking Blin movements across the kingdom… leaving six on the front lines, sieging Talus as we speak. In short… I don’t see that we have the resources to spare to task a team to her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said, massaging her temple. “Remind me again—what was Allanah’s affinity?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Blue/Green, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Alright. So we’ll send Cove and half a dozen veteran soldiers—as many with higher than baseline affinities as we can spare. Is that doable?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace. I’ll see to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Captain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda glanced briefly towards Sage Chalia. The thought crossed her mind to ask about recruiting another Seeker or three, but pushing her luck with Vestele right now was the last thing she needed. She returned to her notes. What else?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. No matter how she looked at it, she kept coming to the same conclusion. She <i>really</i> needed those other fragments to clarify her dreams.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace?” Chalia. “What of the pendant?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed. “I suppose we’ll have it returned with Vesyrn’s team,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what of Ryn’s exposure?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She set down her notes and eyed the sage. Chalia seemed to shrink under her gaze.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked back to Shesan. What was it she said? “Easiest to influence?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If Ryn is compromised, the entire team is compromised, and frankly we cannot afford to second guess ourselves at this juncture,” Zelda said firmly. “We’ve already had Fi examine both the item and Ryn, and she detected nothing out of the ordinary. If it were otherwise I would be more concerned, but as is, I see no reason for alarm. The pendant will be turned over to the Seekers for further inspection, but holding up Ryn or the rest of the team out of, frankly, unfounded paranoia, is out of the question.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chalia pursed her lips and gave a single nod. “As you say, Your Grace. I will inform the High Priestess.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please do, thank you,” Zelda said, feeling slightly relieved. “Oh, and I have decided that Shesan and I will be leaving by boat to rendezvous with Vesyrn as soon as possible. Acquiring the fragments is now my top priority. Any representatives of the Order of Sages or of the Seekers are welcome to join us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I will relay this to Her Holiness.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded in acknowledgement. “Laylith, can you handle making preparations for us to leave? As soon as we are able.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright then,” Zelda said. “I think that covers everything. Anyone have anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence all around, and a few minute shakes of the head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Meeting adjourned, then. Thank you all, and best of luck to our Champions. May the blessing of the Goddesses be with them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s eyes went straight to Shesan as the others stood to depart. She had <i>so many questions.</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Thus concludes the meeting,” Fi said, relaxing into a normal posture—normal for her, anyway—and speaking with her own voice. “Zelda wishes you all luck and the blessings of the Goddesses. I must now depart, as she is requesting my presence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And with that, she dispersed into the aether.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link blinked, then turned to Izu with a frown. “Did that sound rushed to you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu crossed his arms. “Yeah, not sure what’s up with that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. Probably nothing to worry about.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Welp, best get a move on!” Koja said cheerfully, resting her elbows on their shoulders as she poked between them. “That temple's not gonna explore itself!”</span>
<br><br>
