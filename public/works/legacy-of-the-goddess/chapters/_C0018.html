<span>The Gauntlet of Winds—as Link affectionately referred to the absurdly arduous ordeal—was not nearly as long as he remembered. Unencumbered by gale-force winds blowing in his face, the trek through the length of now stationary obstacles was short and uneventful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was glad to have that trial behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Making his way through the open doorway, he found himself in the West Mural Room. There was a nearly identical East Mural Room nearby, at the far end of a short hall. Link had been here before, but tired and weary as he was at the time, he had not stopped to properly admire the artwork. After a surprisingly good night’s rest, he figured he might as well take a moment to do so before pressing on with his quest to unlock the secrets of this place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The walls of both mural rooms were lined with statues of the Goddesses, figurines, fountains, and other varied tokens of religious imagery. Link felt somewhat guilty for not carting at least a few of the items back to be examined by the historians and scholars of the world—and Zelda particularly. But realistically, they couldn’t be expected to carry the entire complex back with them, could they? They had not planned to haul any amount of cargo on the return trip, and it was going to be difficult enough to manage several books and the fragments of the worm-thing’s carapace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With luck, there would be ample time for that later when countless lives were not at stake. With luck, they could figure out how to make more Lightsworn, and then the scholars could come here themselves and catalogue every speck of dust while he went on to do more important things.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link took a look around the room with fresh eyes. He really wished Zelda could see this. The sheer detail that went into these murals was <i>mesmerizing</i>. He was certainly no artist, and attempting to sketch a facsimile that did any of it justice would be an exercise in futility. Every face and every figure had to have been painstakingly crafted over the course of days by a master painter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The mural on the northern wall was his favorite. It depicted the Goddess Hylia blessing a single kneeling warrior with a vast army gathered at his back. Tall and majestic, Hylia shone with an otherworldly radiance befitting none other than the Mother of Creation. The kneeling warrior wielded a gleaming sword with a blue hilt—a sword that glowed with a holy light, surpassed only by the radiance of the Mother Goddess herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no way that was anything but the Sword of Evil’s Bane! Its inclusion in the mural here proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was real and not just a story. Link couldn’t wait to throw this back in Shesan’s face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But enough dawdling; he could worry about that later. Right now there was work to do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Halfway down the short hall towards the eastern room was a green-runed door that barred the way to the next part of the complex. Link supplied a green gem, and the runes on the door pulsed. The gem spun and the door slid upward… to reveal another green-runed door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thankfully Link had taken the time to “solve” the puzzle in the sandpit room. He supplied a second green gemstone and the second door receded. Beyond the door was a flight of stairs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Only three levels to go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Judging by the view from the outside, the worst of it was behind him; the structure narrowed considerably towards the higher tiers. Link estimated he had traversed well over half the complex by now. What more could it throw at him?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He ascended the stairs. A towering statue of Hylia stood at the center of the room, and there was another mural on the far wall. In the mural, two warriors stood back-to-back, facing away towards either side of a branching path. One wore robes and their hands glowed with magic. The other wore armor and brandished a sword. Barring the way of both were stylized figures of three monstrous foes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked to his left and to his right. To either side of the room were massive runed doors. Each glowed with a faint white light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A sense of dread rose up from within.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Two warriors; two paths. Three foes to either side. This was the final challenge, wasn’t it? He was to choose a path, then face off with a series of powerful monsters to prove his worth as a Lightsworn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was he ready?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link couldn’t help but imagine the corpse of Geira’s avatar behind the massive ornate door, except less dead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Surely the threats ahead wouldn’t be <i>that</i> dire. How bad could they be? Nothing else in this place had proved to be all that dangerous…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He thought back to the three Stalfos that had ambushed him earlier. He had burned the entirety of his reserves in that fight, and even then suffered a nasty cut that required immediate attention. Had that played out differently—had he chosen a different approach to the second wind tunnel and had just a little less magic to rely on…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced down at his forearm and flexed his hand. The sutured and mended wound still ached and itched slightly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Three foes. Each of them more, or less dire than three Stalfos?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Probably more. That gave him pause.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was also the Stalnox to judge by. That was a harrowing fight. Could he expect much worse than it? Alone he stood no chance against the monstrosity, but the raw power of the transfabrulator proved decisive—once Link figured out how to use it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Surely the creators of this place had taken that into account? There was no way he would be able to just use a magic gizmo supplied to him earlier on in order to brute-force his way through the trials ahead. Anyone could do that. If that was the case, what would be the point of having the trials in the first place?</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Or maybe that <i>was</i> the point? One of the murals in the previous room featured a warrior in a green tunic holding the transfabrulator, surrounded by the mysterious blocks it produced. A series of images and runes around the mural formed the basis of Fi’s understanding of the device. This was a training ground after all—probably. It would make sense if the trials ahead were just an exercise to further train prospective Lightsworn in use of the ancient weapon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But if that were the case, there was also the mural with the Master Sword to consider, displayed just as prominently in the opposite room. Link’s longsword was among the finest quality in the kingdom, but it was certainly not a mythical blade capable of banishing evil to the depths of the Void. Would the <i>Sword of Evil’s Bane</i> be required to proceed?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Surely not. Surely…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was probably overthinking it. Then again, he had to admit—he wasn’t even sure there was anything else to be found here. He had already found the transfabrulator, and Geira’s avatar was dead. Sure, the ancient Lightsworn structure was a trove of forgotten knowledge and all—but was there anything <i>actually useful</i> beyond these trials? Anything that would aid them in the fight against Ganondorf? Against Demise?</span>
<br><br>
<span>It seemed unlikely. It was possible, yes, but did it make sense to bet his life on it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link found his resolve wavering. He had only persisted this far because…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced up at the statue of Hylia at the center of the room. Something stirred at the back of his mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was this fate? Was this destiny?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He closed his eyes, clenching his fragment of the Triforce of Courage in his hand. It felt silly, but—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—No. He had to have faith. Faith had gotten him this far, hadn’t it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He approached the statue and knelt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dear Hylia,” he whispered. “Holy Mother. Goddess Above. I know you’re not even around anymore. Everyone tells me you died long ago. Even if that’s true, I still have to wonder—what’s all of this for? Why am I here now? It’s too much to be a coincidence… everything that’s happened… you had to have planned it…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked around the empty room as he fumbled for words. He was expecting to feel the same welling of intensity that he had felt so many times before. He was hoping to feel the same conviction that had driven him to stand before the Warlord half a lifetime ago. But as he spoke the words now, they felt cold and empty.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Who was he kidding? Before now, he would have sworn to anyone that he felt Hylia’s guiding hand urging him on. But now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked up again at that motionless, dead statue in this long-forgotten place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked over to his right, at the looming door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I only ever believed because I had to,” he confessed. “I have to be your champion… Because otherwise, I’m just a man.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It hurt to admit, but it was true. He could really die here, and he couldn’t even say for sure that it was worth the risk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But he couldn’t turn back either, could he? Not now. What would he tell the others? What would he tell <i>Zelda</i>?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had to keep going. He had no choice. There wasn’t anyone else who could. For all he knew, there could be a whole cache of ancient Lightsworn artifacts at the top level of the structure, and if he gave up now, then he bore sole responsibility for everything they could have helped avert.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He felt sick. Why did it all have to be so absurd? Was a sign too much to ask for?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just in case you are still listening,” he muttered. “In case you do have a hand in this still… I could really use some help right about now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi appeared at his side. “I would be happy to help, Master. What is it you need assistance with?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link blinked. “Fi, I thought you couldn’t manifest an avatar here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her colors shifted. “Apologies; the interference field does not appear to be active in this location. I was uncertain as to whether I should bring this detail to your attention immediately, but ultimately decided to delay, as I did not judge it to be immediately relevant, and further expected it would distract you from your introspection. Was my judgement in error?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link snorted, then burst out laughing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Master, I am confused; I made no attempt at humor with my previous statement. My models suggest—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, Fi, it’s fine,” Link said, wiping his eyes. “It’s just…” He waved a hand. “It’s not important. You can restore my magic and stamina now, yeah? I mean, if I need you to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Master. Of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grinned. Why had he ever doubted?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span><b>ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙꡩ꡴ꡑꡌꡜ꡷꡴ꡧꡟꡌ:</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>A small handheld device that ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ&rarr;Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ&rarr;ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The device is shaped like a half-circle and fits comfortably in the hand with the flat side facing outward. The body of the device is a smooth featureless metal. The face of the device is inscribed with glowing green runes. Near the thumb is a switch with six states; one for each of the six perfect solids. Below this is a switch with two states for “ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ” and “ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗ.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><b>ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ:</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>When pressure is applied in Ⱑꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ, the device will create an incorporeal image of the indicated solid. The location of this image is controlled by pointing the device and altering pressure to indicate desired distance; tighter for further and looser for nearby. ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ&rarr;Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ then happens following a sharp change in pressure; a Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ with the shape of the indicated solid is created at the location of the image, provided the space is free of obstruction. In the event the space is obstructed, the device will gently but firmly shake to indicate failure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ has a volume of one cubic meter, a functional mass of two-hundred-fifty kilograms, and is functionally indestructible. The Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ will disperse after approximately thirty seconds. The Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ will disperse immediately if the face of the device is touched or if Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ|ꡔꡟꡘꡗꡌꡗꡃꡔꡗ. ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ maximum range: twelve meters. ꡔꡟꡘꡗꡌꡗꡃꡔꡗ maximum range: twenty-four meters.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The device is capable of creating up to three Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ simultaneously. Note: each additional Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ reduces the operating capacity by one unit energy per second. The device normally takes fifteen seconds to fully recharge and thirty seconds to discharge with a single Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b>ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗ:</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ⱑꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗ requires ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ. Note: ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ&rarr;Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ&rArr;ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The device is pointed at ꡔꡟꡘꡗꡌꡗꡃꡔꡗⰡꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ. Pressure is then applied to create ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ between the ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and the device. Note: ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ|Ⱑ requires physical contact with the device to create ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ. If ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ is created, the ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and the device will pulse in unison to indicate success.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ is created, ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ&rarr;ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ happens following a sharp change in pressure. The ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ will be uniformly accelerated to a maximum of fifty meters per second towards the target, indicated by pointing the device. This reduces the operating capacity of the device by up to ten units energy. Note: the speed and corresponding discharge may be roughly controlled by applying less pressure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>For safety, ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ&rarr;ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ will not happen if it would cause the device to be destroyed. In this event, the device will firmly shake to indicate failure.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>If it weren’t for the walls and fake sky-ceiling, Link would have sworn he had just stepped through a portal to the outside world. Around him was a lush, verdant grassland. There were trees and rocks and several large boulders all throughout the room—though at first glance, nothing particularly noteworthy or interesting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If there were any giant monsters here, he didn’t see any.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He set down his pack and bent down to inspect the grass. It looked just like ordinary grass. It smelled like grass. It felt like grass. There was dirt underneath and flowers all around and everything. He plucked a handful from the ground and tossed it into the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. No wind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No bugs either.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was there some kind of puzzle he needed to solve first? Wary, Link crept over to the nearest boulder and tapped it with the transfabrulator.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah! Now that he was a bit closer, he could see it. There was a larger pile of rocks near the center of the room. Something atop them glinted. That was probably it. He jogged over and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Runes all along the rocks lit up with an eerie green glow. The ground rumbled and Link nearly lost his footing. The pile <i>moved</i>, boulders shifting over one another as they rose up into the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link could barely believe what he saw. Before him stood a <i>Stone Talus</i>—a mythical creature of living rock!</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Thump! Thump! Thump!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It teetered on its undersized “legs” as it spun about and bellowed with an unnatural, guttural growl. This thing was absolutely <i>massive</i>. Link dared not get close—any part of it could effortlessly crush him to pulp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Stone Talus reared back. All too late, Link realized it held a boulder in its left hand.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="position: relative;">
    <div id="marker" style="position: absolute; top: 100px;"></div>
</div>
<div id="death-scene">
    <span>His stomach sunk to his feet. He turned and bolted for it, praying to the Goddesses he would make it in time. He dove behind the nearest—<i>AAAUUGH!</i></span>
    <br><br>
    <span><i>The pain! So much pain…</i></span>
    <br><br>
    <span>Link pushed past it, trying desperately to claw himself out from under the boulder. It was no use—it was too heavy. He tried to turn, but he couldn’t even feel anything below his waist. His hands were wet and sticky. Was that blood? That was <i>his</i> blood. There was so much blood…</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>No…</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>No!</span>
    <br><br>
    <span><i>Thump! Thump! Thump!</i> The ground quaked as the Stone Talus drew near, each tremor sending a fresh wave of pain down his spine.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>This was it for him. This was really it. This was how it would end. He was going to die here. He felt hot, and cold, and dizzy, and numb. He didn’t have long before… before…</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>“Fi… tell Zelda… tell her I…”</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>The darkness took him.</span>
    <div id="scene-end">
        <br><br>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="triforce-ex-machina" style="display: none;">
<span>His stomach sunk to his feet. He turned and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—halted in his tracks as a now-familiar sensation washed over him, like trying to hold on to a fleeting dream after waking up from a deep sleep.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He only had one chance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It happened in slow motion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link snatched the transfabrulator from his belt and spun, creating a block off to the side. Several tons of certain death filled his vision, the mass growing larger with every passing thought. He pointed and squeezed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The boulder exploded into a cloud of dust and debris. Link winced as an uncomfortably heavy chunk glanced off his shoulder and several smaller fragments struck his exposed skin. He coughed and sputtered, covering his face with his arms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dust settled—at least enough to see.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Thump! Thump! Thump!</i> The ground quaked as the Stone Talus drew near.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Between it and Link, the green-runed cube sat intact and undamaged. Without a moment’s hesitation, he pointed at the creature and fired again.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><b>CRACK!</b> —GRRRROOOOOOOOWWW!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A blast of air sent Link stumbling back. He struggled to stay on his feet. Ahead, the Stone Talus writhed in agony amid a cloud of shimmering dust. Glowing spiderweb cracks radiated from a missing chunk at its right shoulder—its entire arm had been obliterated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stared at the transfabrulator in awe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once more, the cube rested mere feet from the creature.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t about to give it another chance. Link aimed for the exposed, glowing area and—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><b>BOOM!</b></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A second pressure wave knocked him to the ground and sent him sliding along the grass. He scrambled to recover, but all that was left of the Stone Talus was shimmering dust and a pile of rubble.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link sat with his back up against a wall as he recovered from the encounter. He was shaken, but uninjured—save for some scratches and a bruise on his shoulder. Nothing his own healing couldn’t fix.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…But he had almost died. <i>Again.</i> If it weren’t for the fragment…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He still had two more challenges to go, and he wasn’t even sure if the fragment would protect him a second time. He didn’t want to test it. There was no turning back, either. The door he entered from was still closed. The only way out lay ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link rubbed his face, resting his head in his hands. For what felt like the millionth time, he found himself in doubt. It was always so clear to him, until it wasn’t.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goddess Above,” he whispered. “I need courage. Now, more than ever.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Failing to receive any kind of answer, he dragged himself to his feet and continued on through the open doorway.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Where the first room was the image of lush grasslands, the second was a sweltering desert. There was still no wind, but sand dunes—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link barely had a chance to register the event; an enormous aracha burst from the ground, skittering over the sand with frightening speed and kicking up a trail of dust in its wake. It rushed him, closing the distance in an instant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Acting on instinct, Link drew on his red affinity. Every muscle, pore, and fiber of his body burned, flaring to life in a searing fusion of magic and adrenaline. Link tore forward and met with his enemy, <i>slamming</i> his shield into its mass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The oversized aracha was fast, but momentum was still very much on Link’s side. The creature tumbled over itself, swiping blindly with the larger of its two claws as it scrambled for purchase. Link closed and batted the claw away, stepping in to strike before the thing could recover.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He struck true, cutting deep into the aracha’s chitinous armor. Link yanked his sword free, and the creature let out a sicking <i>screetch</i> as a small chunk of its carapace broke loose. Orange blood seeped from the wound. It staggered backward, frantically lashing out with its venomous tail.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Deftly, Link dodged and closed, driving his sword into the creature’s brains and burying it up to the hilt. The enormous aracha twitched once, then went limp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link twisted his sword free with a kick, then fell back, easing up on his magic. He scanned the room for additional threats.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Save for his own heart pounding in his ears, the room was quiet and still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…<i>Mother Above</i>, that was intense!</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paced, catching his breath as he dealt with the emotional whiplash. To go so quickly from resignation and dread, to <i>this</i>?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He fell to the ground, laughing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This place. These challenges…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked over to the corpse of the monstrous aracha. How was that supposed to be the same kind of challenge as the Stone Talus?</span>
<br><br>
<span>—But then again, maybe his victory wasn’t as complete as it seemed. What if that thing had stung him? He had no antidote on hand—even assuming it was normal aracha venom and not an insanely deadly version instead. A drop of it in his blood likely would have meant death in this place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s smile faded as he considered how close the barb came to his skin. Caught up in the fight, he hadn’t even given it a thought as he dodged in between its strikes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head, putting the thought from his mind. Best not to dwell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked ahead to the next room. Only one challenge remained.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What could he expect? Most of it was behind him now. Was there anything he could use from these fights to prepare himself for the last one? There had to be a thread of commonality between them. Why would you put trainees blindly through life-threatening ordeals such as these, if there wasn’t a deeper purpose behind it? He could probably figure it out, if he just slowed down and took the time to think about it properly. He was usually pretty good at that kind of thing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, go ahead,” he said, shuffling through his pack to dig out his rations. “Time to rest up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish, Master,” Fi said, her chromatic form zipping in chaotic circles above his head. Link chewed on his food and contemplated, completely ignoring her dancing as she whirled about. He was used to it by now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There were two paths, and this path was for warriors. How did he differ from the average warrior? —Or not the average warrior, but the prospective Lightsworn for which these trials were intended. Link had his strengths—and it always made sense to play to your strengths. With a sword and shield in his hands, he was as confident and capable as any, and years of practice had made him a particularly skilled archer. His intuitive use of Invigorate was <i>literally</i> a blessing from the Goddesses, and his use of Luck in conjunction with that was an absurdly powerful combination. He even possessed a fragment of the Triforce of Courage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His ability to use Invigorate with a sword alone let him make short work of the giant aracha, but even that failed to set him apart from what he imagined a Lightsworn-trainee of yore to be capable of. There was no way he was special in that regard—and besides, no amount of martial prowess mattered when it came to the Stone Talus. How could any warrior be expected to fight a monolithic titan of living rock head-on?</span>
<br><br>
<span>They couldn’t, obviously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Of course, there was the transfabrulator—but he couldn’t exactly rely on it, either. Its power was phenomenal, but limited. He could launch a single block only three times before the device had to recharge, and during that period it was nothing more than a useless chunk of metal. The Stone Talus was obviously weak to it somehow—more so than one would expect anything to be “weak” to massive blocks flying around at the speed of an arrow. But even then, Link’s clumsy use of the device in that fight was only just enough to allow him a victory. He got lucky. Only an idiot relied on luck—and if he wasn’t careful, very soon his luck could run out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He really wished he had more time to practice with the transfabrulator. There were probably more effective ways of using the ancient weapon that he hadn’t thought of yet—like defending himself from a boulder being lobbed at his head. He certainly wouldn’t have thought to try that had his life not depended on it, and if he wasn’t so good at thinking on his feet…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Hmm. Something itched there. Link followed the strand of thought, teasing it apart.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ignoring for a moment his brush with death in the first fight, both fights were thoroughly decisive. But whether it was a rock-monster lobbing a boulder from afar to smash him to bits, or the probably-lethal venom from a giant aracha’s stinger, in both fights there was an imminent danger that could have ended him in a heartbeat if he made the wrong move.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If he knew what to expect ahead of time, neither of those fights would have worried him in the slightest. But he didn’t—and that was not just because of his own lack of knowledge. No, this trial in particular seemed designed that way. If the Lightsworn who had lived and trained here previously knew what to expect from this trial, what were the murals outside for?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was on to something—he could feel it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a stretch, but… Voidspawn were not conventional enemies. Whatever <i>these things</i> were—they were not conventional enemies either. Maybe the challenges weren’t intended as a test of strength or ability at all? Maybe instead, what they actually tested was the capacity to recognize danger, and to adapt to it and overcome it in the moment? You could train for a lifetime to fight a known enemy, but that training wouldn’t get you very far against otherworldly creatures from the depths of the Void.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Putting aside the horror of actually being in the middle of that kind of test, Link could see the sense of it. This was a trial for <i>Lightsworn</i>—Hylia’s chosen, tasked with defending the realm from evils that lurked beyond. Why would you waste time with someone who was incapable of dealing with unfamiliar threats? On someone who relied too heavily on their own abilities, trusting in their magic, brute force, or martial prowess alone to carry them through?</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother—that was almost him, wasn’t it? Link smacked himself. It wasn’t <i>courage</i> that he lacked, but <i>wisdom</i>. He came in here expecting to fight, and it had almost cost him his life. Instead, he should have approached it with a tactical mindset.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Stone Talus had a weakness—a predictable one, but a weakness nonetheless. Hitting it with the blocks from the transfabrulator caused it to shatter into a cloud of dust and glass. Did the giant aracha have a weakness too?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link headed over to examine the thing with fresh eyes. It was fast and light. It could burrow into the sand. Its chitinous armor was also pretty tough—few things could stop a magically-enhanced strike with an imbued sword. It probably wouldn’t have survived a direct hit from the transfabrulator, but given its speed and reflexes, Link wouldn’t have been surprised if it managed to dodge a block fired from a moderate distance. He hadn’t consciously thought about that at the time, but there was a reason his instincts drove him to close with his sword and shield. He never questioned his intuition.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gave the aracha a good shove with his foot. If it had a weakness other than “dying when you shoved a sword through its brains,” he wasn’t sure what it was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Maybe he was overthinking it. He did tend to do that sometimes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Returning to his food, he circled back to the first question. What could he do to prepare for the last fight? If he was right about the nature of these trials, he wasn’t sure if there was anything he could do, other than to stay alert, anticipating both deadly threats and possible openings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was rather good at thinking on his feet. It had gotten him out of more than a few troubles over the years.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Would it be enough?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He didn’t like leaving things to chance, and he <i>really</i> didn’t like coming in here like this, not knowing at all what to expect. But ultimately, he had no choice—both figuratively, and literally. The way back was blocked. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t turn back. He had to keep going.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It always came back to that, didn’t it? Did he ever have a choice? It seemed like everything he ever did was either thrust upon him, or was the result of his own convictions urging him to action in the moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He couldn’t very well choose to give up on his ideals, could he?</span>
<br><br>
<span>No; that was just what it meant to be true to yourself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link found himself nodding. That sentiment resonated with him deeply.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had made a choice. One choice—a single choice—long, long ago.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had chosen to be the hero.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And when he looked at it like that, everything else was really just the world testing his resolve.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Do you have what it takes to be the hero, Link?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He rose to his feet, looking on to the open passage ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goddess Above,” he whispered, feeling once more the conviction burning within. “I <i>will</i> be your champion.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link neared the passage. As before, he could see nothing of the next room; a barrier of shimmering white light blocked his view. Ready as ever, he stepped through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He strained to see in the dim light of the room beyond. It wasn’t exactly <i>dark</i>, but it was much dimmer than the previous two rooms, and it took his eyes a moment to adjust. It looked to be a large cavern full of loose dirt, more or less flat in all directions. Though it was a lot smaller, it reminded him an awful lot of the room downstairs—the room that held the remains of Morudo Geira’s avatar.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He didn’t like that. He didn’t like that at all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was nowhere to hide, and his enemy was likely to come up from below. Link took his sword in one hand and the transfabrulator in the other. At the first sign of movement, he’d…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The hair on his skin stood up. What was that sound?</span>
<br><br>
<span>If he wasn’t looking for it, he might have missed it. On the far side of the room, two mounds of dirt shifted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wasted no time, manifesting a cube and climbing on top. The mounds shifted again as he moved, faster this time, picking up speed as they went. One snaked around to his left while the other went to the center of the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were moving in for a pincer attack. Not good. Link’s heart thrummed in his chest. He tensed, expecting an attack, but the movement ceased.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were maintaining distance. Lying in wait.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seconds crawled by in what felt like an eternity. He was all too aware of the passing of time. Every second spent waiting was one second closer to the transfabrulator running out of energy and leaving him exposed. But what could he do? His enemies were burrowed safely underground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…How did they know where he was?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thinking quickly, he took an arrow from his quiver and tossed it several feet away. No sooner than it landed, the freakishly grotesque head of some alien monstrosity erupted from the mound at the center of the room. A pair of mandibles parted with a loud <i>shriek</i> and its three eyes swiveled to fixate on him. Energy crackled between the two claw-like antennae on its head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link only just managed to keep his nerves in check. He summoned a sphere with the transfabrulator, but before he could take aim, the creature launched a ball of lightning his way. Link did the only sensible thing he could, jumping down to hide behind the cube. Not a moment too soon, as the ball hit and exploded in a shower of sparks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link spun. Caught up in the moment, he had all but forgotten to keep eyes on the other mound. He barely had time to throw himself out of the way as the second creature breached the surface and flew through the space he previously occupied. He didn’t get a good look at it, but it was at least as wide as he was, and twice as long. It skidded along the surface of the ground as it landed, then burrowed back underground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scrambled back to the cube and peered around the corner. The first creature was still above the surface, its head wobbling about. Good. He took aim and let the sphere fly.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Crunch! Thud!</i> The sphere slammed into the dirt and threw up a plume as the alien monstrosity’s head exploded into wormgoop.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One down, one to—<i>aaugh!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The second creature came at him again, and this time he wasn’t fast enough to get out of the way. It clipped him in passing, knocking him to the ground and tearing a long gash in his side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link winced in pain as he staggered to his feet. Its razor-sharp mandibles had cut clean through his armor, but thankfully the wound underneath wasn’t deep. To his right, the cube fuzzed and vanished in a shower of green light. Link strapped the transfabrulator to his belt and pulled his shield to guard. The mound of dirt ahead sped away from him, then stopped and turned back, building up speed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had to end this now. He waited until just the right moment and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link drew sharply on his red affinity. The world came to a near halt. He broke into a dead sprint, kicking up dirt in his wake. The worm-thing’s grotesque head broke through the surface, and its body followed up in an arc. Its alien eyes fixed on him and it opened its maw wide.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the last second, Link slid to the ground, then sprang up with all his might, driving his shield into the creature from below. It <i>shrieked</i> as it landed, crashing into the dirt and thrashing wildly a few meters away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was it! He might not get another chance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a fierce cry, he tore forward and leapt through the air, bringing his sword to bear. His blade sunk deep into his foe. It writhed and bucked underneath him, but he held on tight, stabbing it again and again, over and over, merciless and unrelenting in his assault. The worm-creature jerked and twitched violently, but its thrashing grew weaker with every attack until at last it fell still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Panting, Link pulled his sword free and plunged it into the thing’s head once more for good measure, then fell away, completely exhausted.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After taking time to restore, patch himself up as best he could, and scarf down the last of his rations, Link made it up the stairs to the fourth floor. It was dark here, so he needed his lantern.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was really hoping there wasn’t much more he had to do before he could head back to base camp. He could really use a nap.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The fourth floor, as best he could tell, consisted of a single medium-sized room with an altar at its center. There were sconces along the walls, though they held no torches. A stone tablet sat in front of the altar, with a familiar script etched across its surface. The way ahead was open.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi? What’s it say?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It says: ‘Congratulations, initiate, on successfully completing your trials. Please place the transfabrulator upon the altar so that it may be used to test the next candidate, then proceed ahead to receive your blessing.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link did a double take. “What? No—why would I do that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Master, the architects of this facility likely did not take into account the eventualities which lead to the present situation. As the transfabrulator confers exceptional tactical utility, I must insist that you ignore the instructions and proceed ahead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yep,</i>” Link said with a chuckle. “My thoughts exactly, Fi.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>He ventured on through the open passage, down an empty spiralling hallway and up a final set of stairs that let out into the open air. He shielded his eyes as they adjusted to the light. Though it felt like days since he started the final trial, it was still morning. it had only been three hours at most since he set out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He found himself on an open platform under the obsidian obelisk. It rose up above, apparently unsupported by any part of the structure. A large basin stood at the center of the platform, filled with shimmering, sky blue water. There was nothing else in sight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was this the “blessing”?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He approached and dipped a finger into the pool. It was cool and refreshing. Link unclasped his empty waterskin and dunked it into the basin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Huh? He lifted it in and out of the water. It wouldn’t fill. Not only was the waterskin empty, but it was still bone dry.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What the heck? So much for that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He bent forward and cupped his hands, taking in a mouthful. It was ice cold, but in a nice way. It had to be the best, most refreshing water he’d ever tasted. As he swallowed, he felt a relaxing chill spread through his body. He felt lighter, as if he were previously tethered down and was now free.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His head swam and his vision blurred.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grunted. “Uhhhh—<i>hrk.</i> Maybe that wasn’t the best idea.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world washed away in a burst of blinding light.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link awoke, submerged in water. He swam up and climbed atop the surface of a lake of pure, radiant light. Above, a rift in the sky opened to an endless golden expanse. Around him, the lake flowed outward from a single island at its center, cascading over the edges of a great structure in five tiers of luminous waterfalls.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A lone woman stood on the island, clad in a simple robe of the purest white.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The murals did not do her justice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She beckoned him forward, and Link approached.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Holy Mother</i>,” he whispered as he neared. “Is it really you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I must commend you on making it this far, my child,” the Goddess Hylia spoke. Link stared wide-eyed, listening intently. He dared not interrupt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Although your trials have only begun, you show great promise. It is the solemn duty of all who walk this path to protect the realm, and to seek out and vanquish evil wherever it is found. The powers you are to wield must only ever serve this purpose. Prove yourself worthy of them, and you will have earned my favor.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s breath caught in his throat. Something about this wasn’t right. If Hylia was still here, then…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He knelt before her. “Holy Mother—please, you must listen! The world needs you! The realm is beset by a great evil already—there isn’t time! A man named Ganondorf… he serves… the dark god Demise…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You doubtless have many questions for me,” Hylia said, speaking over him as if he weren’t there. “Would that I could answer them. Rest assured that I am with you still, guiding your steps from beyond time. Have faith, and you will be rewarded. For now, you must continue your quest. I charge you with this task: release the shade of Ibboso from his eternal prison, and retrieve the fragment of Courage his tribe defends.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She reached out and touched him, and the world fell away. The light of the lake faded, and tendrils of shadow latched onto him, threatening to pull him below the surface.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No… no!” Link cried, fighting against the tendrils. He futility grasped at her hand as he sunk deeper and deeper into the darkness. “Please! Not yet! Please…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Be brave, my child,” Hylia said sadly, her fingers brushing over his. “Go forth, and defend the realm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The darkness swallowed him up.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link opened his eyes to find himself in the middle of a pitched battle. He grabbed his—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Where was his sword?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Where was <i>he</i>?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Disembodied, he took in the battlefield around him. Gerudo armies charged and clashed, chaotic half-formations meeting with each other, shifting and parting like piles of sand in a twisting wind. A cavalry charge swept through where he was standing, but the horses passed through as if they were made of mist.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just ahead, two combatants were locked in a heated struggle. Link’s attention was drawn to the larger of the two—a Gerudo king in resplendent armor, wielding a greatsword with a fragment of gold embedded in its hilt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The landscape <i>changed</i>, the mess of bodies and the chaos of battle fading away to reveal an abandoned graveyard. Shadowy silhouettes shambled back and forth around a decrepit mausoleum. The ghostly form of the same Gerudo king sat atop it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His eyes fell on Link. He stood and pointed his sword, letting out a wail that sent shivers down his spine. The restless dead around him echoed it, their voices mingling together in an unholy cacophony of anguish and torment.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link felt a rushing sensation, and his vision swam once more. He shook his head as his mind cleared. He floated down from the air to land gently on the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked up to see the faces of three rather surprised Sheikah.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja dropped her playing cards.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, hi guys,” he said lamely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Welcome back,” Ryn said fondly. “Been busy, I take it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link?” Grenja said warily. “Why are you glowing?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I—what?” He looked down at his hands. Sure enough… though just as he noticed it, the glow faded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, that’s probably related to the vision I just had,” he said. “I completed the last challenge by defeating three—well, technically four—giant, nasty monsters, one after the other. I then drank some magical water that I think unlocked my potential or something? I’m not sure yet. Then I was transported to the Sacred Realm, and I saw Hylia. Well, not Hylia <i>exactly</i>, but close enough. Anyway, she told me to be brave and to continue on my journey and to protect the realm, and charged me to go free the souls of the damned from their eternal prison. Not sure what to do about that yet, but I think I found another fragment of the Triforce.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The trio stared at him in stunned silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, okay,” Koja said, standing up and straightening herself out. “I was getting tired of this place anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, where exactly are we going?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. “I’m not sure, but I got a vague feeling it was… thataway?” He pointed somewhere off to the east.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww yeah, new mission!” Grenja shouted, pumping his hand in the air. “Time to kill us some ghosts!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err, not sure if we’re supposed to <i>kill</i> them exactly—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You dolt,” Koja said. “You can’t kill ghosts.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, come on! Since when are there ghosts?!” Ryn demanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link smiled to himself. He glad to be back in warm company. “Don’t worry, we’ll talk it over later,” he said. He stretched and let out a big yawn. “Right now, I need a good, long nap.”</span>
