<span>The Gauntlet of Winds—as Ari affectionately referred to the absurdly arduous ordeal—was not nearly as long as he remembered. Unencumbered by gale-force winds blowing in his face, the trek through the length of now stationary obstacles was short and uneventful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was glad to have that trial behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Making his way through the open doorway, he found himself in the West Mural Room. There was a nearly identical East Mural Room nearby, at the far end of a short hall. Ari had been here before, but tired and weary as he was at the time, he had not stopped to properly admire the artwork. After a surprisingly good night’s rest, he figured he might as well take a moment to do so before pressing on with his quest to unlock the secrets of this place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The walls of both mural rooms were lined with statues of the Goddesses, figurines, fountains, and other varied tokens of religious imagery. Ari felt somewhat guilty for not carting at least a few of the items back to be examined by the historians and scholars of the world—and Xayla particularly. But realistically, they couldn’t be expected to carry the entire complex back with them, could they? They had not planned to haul any amount of cargo on the return trip, and it was going to be difficult enough to manage several books and the fragments of the worm-thing’s carapace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With luck, there would be ample time for that later when countless lives were not at stake. With luck, they could figure out how to make more Lightsworn, and then the scholars could come here themselves and catalogue every speck of dust while he went on to do more important things.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari took a look around the room with fresh eyes. He really wished Xayla could see this. The sheer detail that went into these murals was <i>mesmerizing</i>. He was certainly no artist, and attempting to sketch a facsimile that did any of it justice would be an exercise in futility. Every face and every figure had to have been painstakingly crafted over the course of days by a master painter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The mural on the northern wall was his favorite. It depicted the Goddess Avalia blessing a single kneeling warrior with a vast army gathered at his back. Tall and majestic, Avalia shone with an otherworldly radiance befitting none other than the Mother of Creation. The kneeling warrior wielded a gleaming sword with a blue hilt—a sword that glowed with a holy light, surpassed only by the radiance of the Mother Goddess herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no way that was anything but the Blade of Reckoning! Its inclusion in the mural here proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was real and not just a story. Ari couldn’t wait to throw this back in Shesan’s face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But enough dawdling; he could worry about that later. Right now there was work to do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Halfway down the short hall towards the eastern room was a green-runed door that barred the way to the next part of the complex. Ari supplied a green gem, and the runes on the door pulsed. The gem spun and the door slid upward… to reveal another green-runed door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thankfully Ari had taken the time to “solve” the puzzle in the sandpit room. He supplied a second green gemstone and the second door receded. Beyond the door was a flight of stairs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Only three levels to go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Judging by the view from the outside, the worst of it was behind him; the structure narrowed considerably towards the higher tiers. Ari estimated he had traversed well over half the complex by now. What more could it throw at him?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He ascended the stairs. A towering statue of Avalia stood at the center of the room, and there was another mural on the far wall. In the mural, two warriors stood back-to-back, facing away towards either side of a branching path. One wore robes and their hands glowed with magic. The other wore armor and brandished a sword. Barring the way of both were stylized figures of three monstrous foes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari looked to his left and to his right. To either side of the room were massive runed doors. Each glowed with a faint white light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A sense of dread rose up from within.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Two warriors; two paths. Three foes to either side. This was the final challenge, wasn’t it? He was to choose a path, then face off with a series of powerful monsters to prove his worth as a Lightsworn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was he ready?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari couldn’t help but imagine the corpse of Mor Kharath’s avatar behind the massive ornate door, except less dead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Surely the threats ahead wouldn’t be <i>that</i> dire. How bad could they be? Nothing else in this place had proved to be all that dangerous…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He thought back to the three Bonewights that had ambushed him earlier. He had burned the entirety of his reserves in that fight, and even then suffered a nasty cut that required immediate attention. Had that played out differently—had he chosen a different approach to the second wind tunnel and had just a little less magic to rely on…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced down at his forearm and flexed his hand. The sutured and mended wound still ached and itched slightly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Three foes. Each of them more, or less dire than three Bonewights?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Probably more. That gave him pause.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was also the Dreadwight to judge by. That was a harrowing fight. Could he expect much worse than it? Alone he stood no chance against the monstrosity, but the raw power of the transfabrulator proved decisive—once Ari figured out how to use it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Surely the creators of this place had taken that into account? There was no way he would be able to just use a magic gizmo supplied to him earlier on in order to brute-force his way through the trials ahead. Anyone could do that. If that was the case, what would be the point of having the trials in the first place?</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Or maybe that <i>was</i> the point? One of the murals in the previous room featured a warrior in a green tunic holding the transfabrulator, surrounded by the mysterious blocks it produced. A series of images and runes around the mural formed the basis of Null’s understanding of the device. This was a training ground after all—probably. It would make sense if the trials ahead were just an exercise to further train prospective Lightsworn in use of the ancient weapon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But if that were the case, there was also the mural with the Voidbreaker to consider, displayed just as prominently in the opposite room. Ari’s longsword was among the finest quality in the kingdom, but it was certainly not a mythical blade capable of banishing evil to the depths of the Void. Would the <i>Sword of the Sovereigns</i> be required to proceed?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Surely not. Surely…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was probably overthinking it. Then again, he had to admit—he wasn’t even sure there was anything else to be found here. He had already found the transfabrulator, and Mor Kharath’s avatar was dead. Sure, the ancient Lightsworn structure was a trove of forgotten knowledge and all—but was there anything <i>actually useful</i> beyond these trials? Anything that would aid them in the fight against Azahndor? Against Malice?</span>
<br><br>
<span>It seemed unlikely. It was possible, yes, but did it make sense to bet his life on it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari found his resolve wavering. He had only persisted this far because…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced up at the statue of Avalia at the center of the room. Something stirred at the back of his mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was this fate? Was this destiny?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He closed his eyes, clenching his fragment of the Sanctern of Spirit in his hand. It felt silly, but—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—No. He had to have faith. Faith had gotten him this far, hadn’t it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He approached the statue and knelt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dear Avalia,” he whispered. “Holy Mother. Goddess Above. I know you’re not even around anymore. Everyone tells me you died long ago. Even if that’s true, I still have to wonder—what’s all of this for? Why am I here now? It’s too much to be a coincidence… everything that’s happened… you had to have planned it…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari looked around the empty room as he fumbled for words. He was expecting to feel the same welling of intensity that he had felt so many times before. He was hoping to feel the same conviction that had driven him to stand before the Warlord half a lifetime ago. But as he spoke the words now, they felt cold and empty.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Who was he kidding? Before now, he would have sworn to anyone that he felt Avalia’s guiding hand urging him on. But now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked up again at that motionless, dead statue in this long-forgotten place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked over to his right, at the looming door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I only ever believed because I had to,” he confessed. “I have to be your champion… Because otherwise, I’m just a man.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It hurt to admit, but it was true. He could really die here, and he couldn’t even say for sure that it was worth the risk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But he couldn’t turn back either, could he? Not now. What would he tell the others? What would he tell <i>Xayla</i>?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had to keep going. He had no choice. There wasn’t anyone else who could. For all he knew, there could be a whole cache of ancient Lightsworn artifacts at the top level of the structure, and if he gave up now, then he bore sole responsibility for everything they could have helped avert.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He felt sick. Why did it all have to be so absurd? Was a sign too much to ask for?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just in case you are still listening,” he muttered. “In case you do have a hand in this still… I could really use some help right about now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null appeared at his side. “I would be happy to help. What is it you need assistance with?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari blinked. “Null, I thought you couldn’t manifest an avatar here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her colors shifted through teal and purple in rippling patterns. “Apologies; the interference field does not appear to be active in this location. I was uncertain as to whether I should bring this detail to your attention immediately, but ultimately decided to delay, as I did not judge it to be immediately relevant, and further expected it would distract you from your introspection. Was my judgement in error?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari snorted, then burst out laughing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am confused; I made no attempt at humor with my previous statement. My models suggest—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, Null, it’s fine,” Ari said, wiping his eyes. “It’s just…” He waved a hand. “It’s not important. You can restore my magic and stamina now, yeah? I mean, if I need you to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. Of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari grinned. Why had he ever doubted?</span>
<br><br>

<span><b>ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙꡩ꡴ꡑꡌꡜ꡷꡴ꡧꡟꡌ:</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>A small handheld device that ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ&rarr;Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ&rarr;ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The device is shaped like a half-circle and fits comfortably in the hand with the flat side facing outward. The body of the device is a smooth featureless metal. The face of the device is inscribed with glowing green runes. Near the thumb is a switch with six states; one for each of the six perfect solids. Below this is a switch with two states for “ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ” and “ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗ.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><b>ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ:</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>When pressure is applied in Ⱑꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ, the device will create an incorporeal image of the indicated solid. The location of this image is controlled by pointing the device and altering pressure to indicate desired distance; tighter for further and looser for nearby. ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ&rarr;Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ then happens following a sharp change in pressure; a Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ with the shape of the indicated solid is created at the location of the image, provided the space is free of obstruction. In the event the space is obstructed, the device will gently but firmly shake to indicate failure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ has a volume of one cubic meter, a functional mass of two-hundred-fifty kilograms, and is functionally indestructible. The Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ will disperse after approximately thirty seconds. The Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ will disperse immediately if the face of the device is touched or if Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ|ꡔꡟꡘꡗꡌꡗꡃꡔꡗ. ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧ maximum range: twelve meters. ꡔꡟꡘꡗꡌꡗꡃꡔꡗ maximum range: twenty-four meters.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The device is capable of creating up to three Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ simultaneously. Note: each additional Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ reduces the operating capacity by one unit energy per second. The device normally takes fifteen seconds to fully recharge and thirty seconds to discharge with a single Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b>ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗ:</b></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ⱑꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗ requires ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ. Note: ꡢꡌꡟꡱꡗꡔꡧꡙ&rarr;Ⱑꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ&rArr;ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The device is pointed at ꡔꡟꡘꡗꡌꡗꡃꡔꡗⰡꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ. Pressure is then applied to create ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ between the ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and the device. Note: ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ|Ⱑ requires physical contact with the device to create ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ. If ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ is created, the ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ and the device will pulse in unison to indicate success.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once ꡢ꡴꡶ꡌ꡶ꡃꡚ is created, ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ&rarr;ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ happens following a sharp change in pressure. The ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔ will be uniformly accelerated to a maximum of fifty meters per second towards the target, indicated by pointing the device. This reduces the operating capacity of the device by up to ten units energy. Note: the speed and corresponding discharge may be roughly controlled by applying less pressure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>For safety, ꡧꡌ꡴ꡃꡙ꡷ꡟꡔ꡴ꡧꡗꡙ&rarr;ꡙꡖꡃꡗꡌꡜꡃ꡶ꡔꡙ will not happen if it would cause the device to be destroyed. In this event, the device will firmly shake to indicate failure.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>If it weren’t for the walls and fake sky-ceiling, Ari would have sworn he had just stepped through a portal to the outside world. Around him was a lush, verdant grassland. There were trees and rocks and several large boulders all throughout the room—though at first glance, nothing particularly noteworthy or interesting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If there were any giant monsters here, he didn’t see any.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He set down his pack and bent down to inspect the grass. It looked just like ordinary grass. It smelled like grass. It felt like grass. There was dirt underneath and flowers all around and everything. He plucked a handful from the ground and tossed it into the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. No wind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No bugs either.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was there some kind of puzzle he needed to solve first? Wary, Ari crept over to the nearest boulder and tapped it with the transfabrulator.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah! Now that he was a bit closer, he could see it. There was a larger pile of rocks near the center of the room. Something atop them glinted. That was probably it. He jogged over and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Runes all along the rocks lit up with an eerie green glow. The ground rumbled and Ari nearly lost his footing. The pile <i>moved</i>, boulders shifting over one another as they rose up into the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari could barely believe what he saw. Before him stood a <i>Cragwight</i>—a mythical creature of living rock!</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Thump! Thump! Thump!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It teetered on its undersized “legs” as it spun about and bellowed with an unnatural, guttural growl. This thing was absolutely <i>massive</i>. Ari dared not get close—any part of it could effortlessly crush him to pulp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Cragwight reared back. All too late, Ari realized it held a boulder in its left hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His stomach sunk to his feet. He turned and bolted for it, praying to the Goddesses he would make it in time. He dove behind the nearest—<i>AAAUUGH!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>The pain! So much pain…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari pushed past it, trying desperately to claw himself out from under the boulder. It was no use—it was too heavy. He tried to turn, but he couldn’t even feel anything below his waist. His hands were wet and sticky. Was that blood? That was <i>his</i> blood. There was so much blood…</span>
<br><br>
<span>No…</span>
<br><br>
<span>No!</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Thump! Thump! Thump!</i> The ground quaked as the Cragwight drew near, each tremor sending a fresh wave of pain down his spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was it for him. This was really it. This was how it would end. He was going to die here. He felt hot, and cold, and dizzy, and numb. He didn’t have long before… before…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null… tell Xayla… tell her I…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The darkness took him.</span>
<br><br>
