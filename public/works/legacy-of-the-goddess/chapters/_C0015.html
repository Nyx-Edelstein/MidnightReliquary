<span><i>Thwack!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Her strike against the target dummy made a thoroughly pleasing sound that reverberated off of the cliff walls. A wonderful addition to her practice routine, Zelda thought. Why swing her staff through thin air when she could practice actually hitting something?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She slid back into stance, pulled her staff up to guard, and got into position to begin her kata. Ready. Left, step—<i>strike!</i> Back, turn—<i>strike!</i> Back—<i>thrust!</i> Left, step—<i>strike</i>, step—<i>strike</i>, step—<i>thwack!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, that was so satisfying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda continued her routine. She was not going to worry about Link. She was going to relax and hit things. <i>thwack!</i> Link would be fine. She had asked Koja to look after him. <i>thwack!</i> Koja could handle her brother just fine. It would be no problem for her to make sure Link looked after himself. <i>thwack!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She wasn’t going to worry about the communications delay either. <i>thwack, thwack!</i> Sure, she’d sent half the Sheikah with Link and could no longer maintain the scry-line to Last Bastion. But it was only a two-days’ ride, and they had plenty of able-bodied messengers up to the task. <i>thwack!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>And she was <i>absolutely not</i> going to worry about when the expected communications would get back to her. <i>thwack!</i> If anything, that just meant more time before she had to meet with Shesan again. <i>thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda? Everything okay?” Laylith called from behind. Zelda turned to see her walking up to the makeshift training grounds.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Peachy,” Zelda said with a smile. Her hands were throbbing from hitting the dummy too hard, but she didn’t mind. She turned and propped herself up against her staff, taking a moment to catch her breath and wipe the sweat from her brow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith cocked her head, turning to the dummy then back to Zelda. “What are you doing out here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Practicing!” Zelda said exuberantly. She shuffled over to her canteen and took a sip of water. “I’ve got to keep at it if I ever want to be more than useless in a scuffle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Laylith said. “And why is the dummy wearing a red wig and makeup?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shrugged. “I thought it needed to look more realistic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith snickered. “<i>Uh huh</i>. Sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled and set down her canteen, then shuffled over to a more comfortable distance. “What’s up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, nothing in particular,” Laylith said. “Just thought I’d check and see what you were up to. Have any plans for the day?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have no idea,” Zelda said frankly. “Sit around and whack things while waiting for word from Last Bastion? Not like there’s much else to do out here. I had thought to compile and review my research notes—I have been meaning to do that for a while.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You could do that, yes.” Laylith said. “But how about something fun instead?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Like what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How about an expedition?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a short laugh. “Hah. Good one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith eyed her. “Well?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, you’re serious?” Zelda said, somewhat confused. “Where would we go? And isn’t that dangerous?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith shrugged. “We’ll go out and see what we see. You’ll be safe enough with Cove and me watching your back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er, does Cove have to come?” Zelda said. She bit at her lip.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suppose he can be somewhat of a chatterbox.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yep,</i>” Zelda said with a chuckle. “Sweet guy and all, but more likely than not to dampen the mood.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Laylith said ponderously. “In that case, I suppose it will have to be just us two.” She smiled and gave Zelda a conspiratorial wink.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. I already double checked with Izu,” Laylith said. “As long as we don’t venture too far he doesn’t have a problem with it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay…” Zelda said reservedly. She took out a clean cloth, dampened it with her canteen, and wiped herself down. “What did you have in mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why, that’s entirely up to you, Your Grace. Where to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shot her a look.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith chuckled. “Go on! Lead the way.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Holding her torch high, Zelda ducked under a growth of low-hanging stalactites, watching her step as she went. Laylith trailed close behind, followed by their Gerudo guide.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zarie? Sarii? Sahri? Zelda still wasn’t sure how to pronounce her name. They had found Sahri in short measure after asking around town for a guide, and she was happy and eager to show them around for a few rupees. Supposedly these caves had—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stopped in her tracks as she rounded the corner and took in the sight. Rows and rows of jagged phosphorescent crystals lined the walls of the cave, spiraling deep into the darkness ahead. They glowed faintly, and to her eyes even seemed to pulse at odd intervals. She wasn’t sure if it was just an effect of the contrast of darkness and light on her eyes, but it was absolutely breathtaking nonetheless.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Beautiful, yes?” Sahri said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wonderful,” Zelda said, mesmerized and wholly unable to tear her eyes away. She handed her torch to Laylith and slipped off her pack, rummaging through it to find a canvas and a charcoal pen. Under the torchlight, she sketched the scene.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“When ready, let me know,” Sahri said in broken Hylian. “I will wait just here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Sahri,” Laylith said. “Just a few more minutes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda glanced back at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Take your time,” Laylith whispered, leaning down and patting her on the shoulder. “No rush.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda worked diligently, etching lines of contrast she would fill in with color later. There was so much detail to capture—she was afraid she wouldn’t do it justice. Maybe…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, Laylith?” Zelda said, turning over her shoulder. “I’m going to take a sample real quick.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure,” Laylith said. “I’ll be right here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda slid on a glove, then picked up her staff-slash-walking-stick and scurried over, ducking low. She passed the first few rows, surveying the crystals carefully as she searched for the right one. They varied in size, from roughly the size of her forearm to as small as a finger. She would have loved to take one of the larger ones, but they were far too thick and heavy to dislodge. Zelda tried to pick out a smaller one, but it snapped and shattered as she tried to pry it loose. And they were all clustered so tightly…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah, <i>there</i>. Zelda spotted one roughly the size of a small dagger with a cluster of much smaller crystals around it. Using her staff, she chipped away the smaller ones until just per prize remained.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Hissssss!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ack!” Zelda scurried back. A brightly colored moldorm darted in circles around the broken crystals, edging closer and driving Zelda away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it?!” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A moldorm!” Zelda said. “It’s—ahh! It’s angry! I think, uh—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—So?” Layith said. “Do something about it!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thinking quickly, Zelda whacked it with her staff.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>HISSSSSSS!!!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, that might not have been the brightest move. She succeeded in knocking it away from the crystal, but it shot a cloud of spores straight into her face. Zelda stumbled back, coughing violently. Her lungs burned, and she could already feel her chest tensing up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda! Are you okay?” Laylith darted to her side. “No, no no. Sweetie, what’s wrong?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ꡍⰡꡟꡇꡌ ꡤꡲꡇꡲꡀꡦ!” Sahri yelled from behind. “What are you thinking?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda found it increasingly difficult to move with each passing second. Her limbs felt like they were full of burning lead. She knelt, trying to keep herself steady. “I’m… urgh—”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Don’t panic,</i> she thought to herself. <i>You can handle this.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She drew sharply on her green affinity, pulling up her magic from deep within. Zelda worked to breathe in and out, trying desperately not to cough even as her lungs burned from the inside. Motes of green energy swirled around her body, and slowly her muscles eased up. Just a moment later and she could move freely again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite herself she let out a hacking cough. She felt dizzy and found it hard to focus. She couldn’t make out anything Laylith was saying, and her chest was tensing up again. The spores were still in her lungs. She had to act quickly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pack,” she sputtered between coughs. “Green vial. In my pack. Left side, inner pocket. Quick.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waited as long as she could before drawing on her magic again. Thankfully Laylith located the antidote without issue. She unplugged the stopper and Zelda took in a deep breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Whoa.</i> Spinning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eased onto her back and tried to calm herself. What a rush! Her lungs cleared up, and her limbs tingled. She took the vial from Laylith and breathed in deeply again. Nausea overtook her and she turned to vomit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda! Say something!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine. I’m fine,” Zelda said, wiping her mouth. She turned back to Laylith, looking so concerned for her. Zelda couldn’t help but laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…You’re okay? You’re sure? You’re going to be alright?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Ha!</i> Yeah, I’m fine,” Zelda said, feeling giddy. She broke out into a fit of hysterical laughter. “Heheh. Hahaha—<i>ahahahahah!</i>” Poor Sahri was standing off to the side, looking completely befuddled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Honey, you’re worrying me,” Laylith said in her serious voice. “Is this a side effect of the antidote?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, no,” Zelda said between breaths, waving her off. She fell onto her back and caught her breath. “I’m fine, really. Moldorm spores—a mild paralytic. It’s scary, but not lethal. At least, not usually in healthy adults. Almost never with healing and antidote on hand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She glanced back over to Laylith. The older woman only stared at her incredulously. “You <i>knew</i> there would be moldorms here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda answered honestly. “But I guessed. They’re fairly common in this area and prefer caves just like this one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith continued to gawk at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “What? Did you think I would go out on an expedition unprepared?” Zelda laughed again. Oh, but she felt <i>alive</i>! She hadn’t done anything like this in what felt like ages.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well,” Laylith said. “I think that’s enough excitement for one day. Don’t you agree?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure,” Zelda said, propping herself up. “Soon as I get that crystal. —And some spore samples if I can. Never know when they might come in handy.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link trotted along on his horse, guiding two others by a rope as Ryn rode off to the side. The pair set out to water the horses at a nearby oasis, and also refill their canteens while they had the opportunity. Meanwhile, Grenja and Koja stayed behind to set up camp and secure the area. It would be another seven or eight hours’ ride before they reached their destination, but there were only three hours left in the day. Might as well rest up and get an early start the next morning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link had been in favor of setting up right next to the oasis, but Koja was insistent that she didn’t want to risk dealing with more bandits if they could help it. Neither Grenja nor Ryn had strong opinions, so Link decided not to press the issue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were doing exceptionally well, considering their “guide” had left them at the first opportunity with little more than a crudely drawn map marked with a few points of interest. The map served them well enough, and they had only run into two more bandit camps along the way. What’s more, Zelda had the clever idea of using Fi’s stamina restoration on the horses to make up time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Apparently it was rather expensive to use on anyone who didn’t bear Hylia’s mark—horses included. Still, Zelda was okay with him using it sparingly to shave off time. It worked well, knocking about a day and a half off of the trip, though it left the horses far hungrier and thirstier than usual.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Almost there?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scanned the mountains to his right, estimated the distance, then checked the map. “About two or three kilometers that way?” He pointed roughly in the correct direction. “Over that ridge, I think.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn’s head jerked back and she casually scried ahead. On a horse. On uneven terrain. Link shook his head—he didn’t know how she did it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, I see it,” she said after a moment. “Looks clear.” She rode ahead, and Link followed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link appreciated working with Ryn. With her it was always simple and straightforward. No unnecessary banter. No antics. At least when she wasn’t around Koja. She seemed to turn into an entirely different person when the pair were together.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They cleared the ridge and the oasis came into view. A reverse-island of crystal clear water and lush greenery surrounded by cracked, barren clay. Link led his horses up to the bank and dismounted. They lapped up the water eagerly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned back to check with Ryn. She was standing a few feet away with her back turned, bent over and rummaging through her pack. Link couldn’t help but let his eyes linger. The way her hips swayed as she—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Too late, he realized she was watching out of the corner of her eye. Link turned abruptly back to the horses.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey,” Ryn called back to him. “If you’re done admiring the view, care to help out?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep. Sorry,” Link said, feeling as if his face was about to catch fire. Ryn had her hands full fishing the canteens out of her pack, so he took her horse by the reins and led it back to the bank with the others.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry,” Ryn said with a playful laugh, following close behind. “I’m used to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link tried to put the gaffe from his mind. He recalled from his vision that the Obsidian Spire was surrounded by a…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn brushed past and stopped two paces in front of him. She set down the canteens, then bent over slowly, swaying her hips from side to side as she lazily filled one in the ankle-deep water. Even if he wanted to look away, there was no way he could.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh… Ryn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She peered back over her shoulder. “No? Just saying, we’re out here all alone. By ourselves. Not expected back anytime soon. Nobody around for <i>miles</i>. No one has to know.” She winked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s heart drummed in his chest. Was she really—no. No. “Ryn, we’re—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—on a mission,” she finished for him. “Got it, boss.” She grinned and tucked her hair behind her ear as she turned and squatted down, capping one canteen and reaching for a second. “It’s just, that’s never stopped you before,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh. What?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Recon, remember?” She tapped just under her eye. “You wouldn’t believe half the things I see out there.” She made a very lewd gesture with her hand and the canteen.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sputtered and turned away, forgetting he was still holding her horse’s reins. It caught sharply as he turned, causing the horse to whine and rear back. “Woah, woah! Easy now,” he said, trying to calm it and keep the others from getting spooked. It didn’t help that he was on edge himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn cackled and stepped over to help. “Hey, relax,” she said in a soft, sweet voice. She gently patted the horse’s muzzle, but kept her eyes fixed on his. “Hey there. See? It’s okay. I’m just teasing you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s not funny,” Link said, trying to keep his own nerves in check.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Never said it was,” Ryn said with a slight shrug. “It just so happens I enjoy turning you into a gibbering mess. I’ve got to find some way to stay sane out here. Fill up my own bottle for later, if you know what I mean.” <i>Wink</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whuh,” Link said, trying and failing to picture anything other than what she had just vividly painted for him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn giggled and rubbed her hands together gleefully as she stepped away and returned to filling the canteens. “So, how do you do it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Um. Do what?” Link said, his mind still refusing to function.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned back to him, raising an eyebrow. “Everyone has <i>needs</i>, Link. How do you take care of yours?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I—<i>what</i>? I really don’t think this is appro—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, the ’ol bushwhacking duty. Got it. Feel free to ask if you ever need a helping hand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Ryn!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fiiine,” she said, giggling. “Can’t blame a girl for trying.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>His thoughts finally caught up to him—at least enough to form a more coherent response. “Look, I like you and all,” he said, “but shouldn’t we—I don’t know—get to know each other first? Maybe when we get back from all this, we can get together sometime?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nope, too late,” Ryn said flatly. “Feeling’s passed. Not interested anymore.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh.” Really? He would never understand women. “Alright then.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn groaned. “That was a <i>joke</i>! Come on, Link. Lighten up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A joke? How was that supposed to be funny? What else was he supposed to do other than take her at her word? “So does that mean…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stood, eyeing him. “You’re serious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Maybe?” he ventured. He wasn’t exactly looking for a partner, but Ryn did tick a few boxes. “I mean, if you are. I’m willing to give it a shot at least.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…I’m not looking for a relationship, Link.” Ryn turned away, suddenly looking much colder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh. I just thought… I mean, yeah, okay. I understand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, you’re a great guy—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, really. I understand,” Link repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You <i>understand</i>,” Ryn said skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Link said. “I get it. Relationships—they’re a lot of work, right? Lots of maintenance. And expectations, so many expectations. Too many questions, never enough space. You don’t need that in your life right now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Right. Exactly!” Ryn said, brushing a strand of hair aside. “I mean, no. No, I don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, me neither.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Last thing on my mind right now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, same.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good!” Ryn said with finality. “I’m glad we understand each other.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Me too,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not even considering it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not even a little.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Definitely not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not. At. All.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm.” Ryn sauntered a couple steps closer. “Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took another step, sliding up against him. “Say no?” she said, reaching up and trailing a finger over his lips. “Just once. Just one time, actually say the word ‘no’ and I’ll back off. ’Kay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked deep into her eyes, and nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda sat down with a cup of tea to review her research notes and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace? He’s here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Finally!</i> The messenger from Last Bastion had arrived. Zelda set down her tea and strode out of her tent to meet him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Where…? Ah! She spotted Olvas just ahead—the same messenger that brought them the news of the Zora crisis. Zelda noted he had a thick parcel in hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good news, I hope?” she called out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wonderful news, Your Grace!” Olvas said. He nodded to the soldier he was conversing with and made his way over. “<i>A Warlord!</i> We’ve slain another Warlord!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s wonderful news indeed!” Zelda said, elated to hear of the progress being made. “What news from the front?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, the Blin front has all but collapsed,” Olvas said, handing the parcel to her. “They’re pushing to retake Talus—a week ahead of the last estimates, I believe. Current estimates put it at eight to twelve days if the rout continues.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can hardly believe it!” Zelda said. “We’re really doing this? We’re really pushing back the Blight?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It seems so, Your Grace,” Olvas said, beaming. He gestured to the parcel. “It’s all in the report of course. And I’m more than happy to answer any questions you may have, at your leisure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, of course,” Zelda said. “Thank you, Olvas. Please, take some time to rest. I’m sure you’ve had a long day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s my pleasure to serve, Your Grace.” Olvas bowed, then departed.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda sipped her tea as she took inventory of the parcel. A several-page war report, as promised by Olvas. A letter stamped with the Sheikah sigil. An official scroll from the Council, tied in blue ribbon. A letter from Vestele, and a message from Lensa.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She started with the war report. It didn’t have much more high-level information than what Olvas had already provided—mostly dry details on logistics and troop movements as per usual. She was certain Link would be ecstatic to look over it when he returned. Speaking of…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi? Could you let Link know what Olvas told me? About the Warlord? I’m certain he’ll be excited to hear it. And let him know the reports are waiting for him when he returns.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes, Mistress. I will do so.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>That was <i>so awesome</i>! How had they not taken advantage of Fi’s abilities sooner? Zelda made a mental note to follow up later, and returned to the letters.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Two full squads dispatched to meet with Vesyrn and Allanah. Good, good. …She would have to tell Shesan of course. And the scroll—yep! Exactly as expected: it was a signed and sealed writ transferring land rights to the twenty-second barony of the Royal Province to House Sunseeker.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Only, House Sunseeker did not yet exist. No problem; Zelda could fix that in short order. It seemed she owed Naibi a visit soon too.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What did Vestele have to say?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br><i>
<span>Your Grace,</span>
<br><br>
<span>As per your charge, I have done what I can to prevent hostilities from escalating. You should know this has not been easy. Shortly after the initial wave of refugees, a group of disgruntled fishermen raided and attacked the Zora in retaliation for themselves being attacked by turned Zora. I wish I could say our guests were understanding—it should come as no surprise to you that they were anything but.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Prime Counselor Taetus pushed immediately to establish a framework for dispute resolution, and at his suggestion, the Council passed laws requiring aggressing Hylian parties to pay reparations or face harsh penalties. In return the Zora have agreed to minimize encroachment into populated areas, and to not interfere with the fishing industry in general. Further, they are required to police themselves and alert Hylian governance of any groups of suspected turned Zora. They agreed to this only after we agreed not to interfere whatsoever in their affairs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I would characterize the situation as tense, but stable. At least for the time being. I hope we have done enough to deter future attacks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>More on the Prime Counselor; you should know that I have relied substantially on him in these matters. Truthfully my role has been little more than perfunctory, acting as a glorified liaison between him and the Council and Sages Rutilo and Vulas.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If I may speak frankly, I have no idea why you have chosen me for this task. Even so, I have acted faithfully and to the best of my ability in service to the Crown. Zelda—I do not know what game you are playing at, but in the future, I request in the strongest possible terms that you not involve the Faith in matters of governance and diplomacy. I would like to speak with you personally at the earliest convenience.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yours Truly,</span>
<br>
<span>Vestele</span>
<br><br>

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda sighed. She knew neither Vestele nor the Council would be happy, but she definitely made the right choice here. She set the letter aside—she would deal with it later.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>

<span>As requested, I have sent an envoy with a suitable escort to relay your message to the Gorons. We are unaware of any particular settlements or locations, but the team is capable and has my full confidence. Unfortunately no Sheikah assets could be spared. I will notify you if and when we receive word back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>My aides brought to my attention a series of letters from the Council archives. It seems the rumors involving King Rhosalus Hyrule had origins in truth. The letters detail an exchange wherein the Goron Chieftain—Rhargon—demanded King Rhosalus personally honor a blood-oath to avenge Rhargon’s father, Bhurdon. Supposedly Bhurdon was killed by a Lynel on business with the King. The King refused, stating he had never made such an oath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I am working diligently to obtain more information. I will notify you should any arise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sincerely,</span>
<br>
<span>Countess Lensa, House Oda</span>
<br><br></i>

<br>
<span>Lensa’s letter was short and to the point. Interesting, but Zelda wasn’t sure there was anything actionable just yet. Hmm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well. Plenty more to do before the day was over. Best get to it.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda waited patiently at the edge of the third level rise in the Sunseeker encampment. She was told Naibi would “return soonly.” In truth, she didn’t mind the wait. She had an interesting view of the small town from here, as well as the area immediately outside. The evening sun always had a way of giving character to places, and here the effect was nothing short of enchanting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So many people had arrived in the past few days. More and more by the hour. The market square was positively bristling with activity to the point it overflowed into every street and alley Zelda could see. Outside the town was much the same, with makeshift stands and stalls set up at regular intervals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just to think—in a few days’ time all of these people would uproot their lives and travel for weeks to begin anew.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was an interesting thought, framed thus. These people—<i>Gerudo people</i>—would be a part of her kingdom. At least in some respect, she had accomplished something even Father had failed to do. She had made peace with the Gerudo.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda wasn’t about to kid herself; few things were so simple, and this was certainly not one. It had taken a Blight to get here, and then some. It was only one tribe, and they were <i>far</i> from being out of the woods just yet. There would be complications, and setbacks. The Noble houses would throw a tantrum, and the Sunseekers would have their own share of pains.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But Zelda was also a scholar. She knew roughly what might be written about these days, presuming her kingdom survived long enough for that history to be written. And right now, something powerful was happening. Something <i>magical</i>. A magic that transcended time—a magic far greater than any a single person could ever hope to wield. The events of these days would have far-reaching implications that would resound throughout the ages, touching the lives of all who came after. Two peoples with a common origin, separated by war and strife. Two cultures with a <i>thousand years</i> of complex and mired history between them…</span>
<br><br>
<span>And she had united them in pursuit of a common goal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her! Zelda!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Somehow, she felt both pride and humility in equal measure. It was hard not to let it go to her head, and also not to buckle under the strain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She smiled. Father would be proud.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Well, it was either that, or her world would be burnt to a crisp or devoured or whatever else Demise had in store for them. But she had to hold on to hope. What else was there?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked back over the small town. What had these people gone through? How jarring had the shift to their culture been? She tried to imagine what that would be like for her own people to go through such an ordeal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She supposed common knowledge that their Mother Goddess had been dead for ages might do the trick. Heh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Queen Zelda! You have good news for me, I hope?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned to see Naibi ascending the stairs to her left. She waved the scroll she held in her hand and winked.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“So this is it?” Naibi asked, looking over the scroll. “It is done?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Almost,” Zelda said. “There is one matter remaining. House Sunseeker does not technically exist at present.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what does this mean?” Naibi asked, narrowing her eyes suspiciously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Practically? Nothing,” Zelda said with a shrug. “We can remedy that right here and now if you’re ready.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi nodded. “I am ready. What must I do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A simple ceremony,” Zelda said. “A pledge of fealty from you, and a proclamation from me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And that is all?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “That’s all. Your regiment reports for duty, and the lands are yours. Well, plus or minus a few Blin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here, or…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here is fine. We don’t have to make a show of it, unless you really want to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi crossed her arms and turned slightly. Was she having second thoughts?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I am to do this,” she said, turning to meet Zelda’s eyes, “know that I do not do it lightly. I would do anything to see my tribe safe—even if that means pledging myself to a Hylian Queen. First promise me you will never ask me to betray them or their trust.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I understand that completely, Naibi,” Zelda said solemnly. “And I feel much the same. You have my word. After today, your people are my people too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi turned and drew her sword, kneeling and placing it at Zelda’s feet. “Queen Zelda,” she said earnestly, “in honor of our pact and in view of the gods above, I, Naibi, First of the Sunseekers, pledge my sword and my life to you. I am yours from this day to my last.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wow. A bit and a half more than she was anticipating, but it would do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. Naibi, First of the Sunseekers: I, Queen Zelda Numenia Proventia Hyrule, hereby charge you with the protection of your lands and service to the Crown. Do you accept my charge?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes? I just said—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Then rise, Baroness Naibi of House Sunseeker, with my blessing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi did so, sheathing her sword.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re in this together, Naibi,” Zelda said. She offered a hand. Naibi took it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Zelda. For this opportunity. I will uphold my end of the bargain.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>One last thing to do for the day, and then she could rest. Zelda was determined to keep it brief. It was just business. Just a mutual update of information. That’s all. Five minutes and she’d be back in her tent. Ten at most.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve received new information,” Zelda said, jumping straight into it. “My arrangement with the Sunseekers has been finalized. Two Sheikah squadrons have been sent to make contact with Vesyrn and his pursuer. I have also sent an envoy to make contact with the Gorons, and my people are working to discover more about why relations broke down. Some interesting leads, though nothing actionable as of yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded and passed her a folded map. Zelda studied it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Golvara’s current location. Additional markers show rough estimates of corrupted Zora concentration and their recent movements.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you,” Zelda said, tucking the map away. “We have a team standing by awaiting orders. I’ll pass this information along as soon as I get back to camp.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good,” Shesan said. “Anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, not presently,” Zelda said. “At least not on the topic of hunting fragments. There has been great progress on the front—we’ve slain a second Warlord. Only one remains, and the Blin army is in shambles. We expect to retake Talus within two weeks, then can turn our attention to cleaning up the remnants.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan grumbled. “It’s not enough. We need to do more.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>More?</i>” Zelda said despite herself. “Sorry—how am <i>I</i> supposed to do more?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan said nothing; continuing to gaze into the distance like a wise-old-<i>bitch</i>. Gah! Zelda wanted nothing more than to storm off and get back to her research, but this woman had a way of getting under her skin. She couldn’t just let that judgement hang over her unchallenged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look,” Zelda said. “I’m pushing the limits on what we can do with the Sheikah already. As it stands, there weren’t any available to escort our envoy to the Gorons. Nearly every able bodied person that can march, take orders, and hold a pointy stick is fighting on the front or contributing in some way to the war effort. The Blight aside, I have <i>so many</i> other issues to contend with. Shesan, people are dying as we speak in raids from roving Blin bands because they lack protection, and more will die as a result of my actions. If you have any actual suggestions as to how I can do <i>more</i>—please! I’m all ears.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda,” Shesan said, turning to face her. “I know you don’t want to hear this, but it’s an obvious truth and you need to acknowledge it. Attempting to keep your kingdom intact in the face of Demise’s assault against your realm only keeps you busy and diverts your attention while he continues to plot and scheme.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda huffed. “So I’m supposed to—what? Just order Wymar to pack up when we’re so close to ending the Blight? Throw my people to the Blin while I set my soldiers to scouring ancient ruins halfway across the world, chasing myths and legends?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know what the right answer is, or even if there is an answer,” Shesan said, sidestepping her objection. “I only know that Ja’bu was not a coincidence. It fits the same pattern I have seen over and over again, since the beginning with the Gerudo. He will pile on the hardships and sow chaos with minimal exertion on his part while he continues, unchallenged. Except, now he is accelerating. Moving faster and making larger plays as he grows more confident in his victory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think Ganondorf is going to wait in the shadows for you to clean up the remnants of the Blin and help the Zora retake their homeland before striking again? <i>No.</i> There will be something else sooner or later—and my bet is on sooner. I don’t know what, but it will hit, and it will hit hard. If we continue as we are, there is no hope.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda told herself she wasn’t going to do this. That she wasn’t going to get drawn into some pointless argument. “Do you have any <i>specific</i> information?” she asked. “Anything more than conjecture?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“More than conjecture, but nothing specific. Call it a hunch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t act on a hunch, Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you had any more dreams lately?” Shesan said, deflecting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nothing new?” Zelda answered with a shrug. “At least none that are obviously prophetic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And did you recognize all of the prophetic ones as ‘obviously prophetic’ before witnessing that which they referred to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Yes? Mostly?” Zelda said, flustered. “I mean, they were ominous, vivid, and had recurring themes. Even so, I didn’t know what they referred to specifically until I learned of the Blight and later of Ja’bu. I’m not sure how I could have known ahead of time. There seems to be two distinct categories—well, three, if you consider random, normal dreams. Obviously portentous ones, and ones that only show me glimpses of odd things—like the man in the forest. And it’s difficult to differentiate the latter from just normal dreams.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So to clarify: no portentous dreams lately?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you said ‘nothing new,’” Shesan said. “Does that mean you’ve had repeats of the same dream?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated. “Maybe? I think so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And you don’t think that might be important?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grunted in frustration. “Yes, I’ve considered this. The only candidate was one that was similar to the circle of Blin in an open field. Same location, except this time it was night, and there was only one of them. He turned and seemed to notice me. When he reached out, I woke up.” She gestured with an open palm. “Do you have any idea what that could mean? Because I don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Shesan said, turning her head, seeming to consider the question seriously. She tapped her fingers together behind her back and paced.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waited with arms crossed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not sure,” Shesan said finally. “And just to be clear, let me preface this by saying it is <i>entirely conjecture</i>. Perhaps there is a group of them undergoing some kind of ritual and your fragments are picking up on the residual magic. Or something.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Or something,” Zelda said flatly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is there something you’re not telling me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Shesan said. “Unfortunately. I’m just as in the dark as you are on this one.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda stared up at her tent, lying on her bedroll, lost in thought and unable to sleep.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All this time she had berated herself for being a poor queen. Every step of the way on this journey she had felt the need to make excuses to herself. To justify why it was necessary for her to come out here while her kingdom and her people suffered in her absence. She had spent so much time before meeting Shesan simply wondering what to do next when she got back. Where was she most needed? How could she best serve her kingdom and make things better for all?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Now, she wasn’t even sure of that. Was Shesan right? Loathe as Zelda was to admit it, she had a point. Their enemies would not play fair, nor wait for them to recuperate. Was Zelda an <i>even worse</i> queen for not committing everything in her power to the ends of getting ahead of Ganondorf’s next move? Of combating Demise?</span>
<br><br>
<span>They didn’t even know what Demise wanted with the Triforce, but it was a safe bet it played a central role in his plans. Would it really bestow him with the power of the Golden Goddesses? Even if not—Ganondorf had at least <i>five</i> fragments of Power already, according to Shesan. Zelda didn’t know what that meant in practical terms, but it was certainly not good for their side. Wars had been fought over single fragments of Power—a single fragment was enough to turn Father into one of the most fearsome warriors of his time. By all accounts, five shards of Wisdom would substantially clarify her dreams, and with that kind of power, they would no longer be left guessing. What would five fragments of Courage do for Link, when one was enough to put an ordinary, though talented soldier on even footing with the Sheikah elite?</span>
<br><br>
<span>There had to be a balance, no? She wouldn’t have any power or a kingdom’s worth of resources if she didn’t maintain said kingdom and protect it from Demise’s attacks. And even if she did commit everything to thwarting him and lost her kingdom in the process, what would be left to fight for?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda had no idea how to proceed. Should she really do as Shesan suggested, and sacrifice everything else in the hopes of getting ahead? Or should she double down on securing her kingdom and hope that they would be able to weather out the storm?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was there any hope at all against a foe that had defeated the Mother of Creation?</span>
<br><br>
