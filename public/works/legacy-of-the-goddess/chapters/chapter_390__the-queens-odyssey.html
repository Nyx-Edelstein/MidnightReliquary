<span>
Xayla lay still, resting her head against Shesan’s leg, delighting in the warmth of skin beneath her cheek and the gentle pulse of a heartbeat not her own. In the relative quiet of the ship’s cabin, she let her thoughts settle after the rush and confusion of the day: tense conversations, revelations of scheming and betrayal… and the faintest glimmer of hope against impossible odds. But now? Only the comfort of being held and protected by this strange woman from another world.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Despite the tumult, she felt safe.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She closed her eyes and relaxed, a pleasant heaviness settling over her limbs. The sounds of creaking wood and water lapping against the hull faded from her mind. She let herself drift—not quite asleep, not quite awake—as her awareness softened at the edges. Shesan’s presence grew distant, replaced by a gentle weightlessness and ease. The world around her narrowed to the slow rhythm of her breath, and then even that began to fade as she quietly slipped into dream.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
In her mind, somewhere far and distant, she settled into a—memory? Her feet dangled from a chair that was too tall, and she felt uncomfortably restricted by a dress tied too tight for her liking. She held a flute to her mouth. How did the melody go again? Pff. It didn’t matter, she could just—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She started out strong, but then felt heat rising from her cheeks as she flubbed the last few notes. Laughter from the other students echoed off the marble walls of the concert hall. Xayla tossed the flute aside and ran backstage, attempting futilely to hide behind a curtain. Of course, the instructor denied her any such reprieve—with a harsh reprimand to follow.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The vision faded from her mind as quickly as it came, but the embarrassment and frustration lingered.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Shadows pressed in. A corridor stretched before her, endless and narrow. She couldn’t shake the sense of being watched by something just out of sight, a presence she couldn’t name. Fear pounded in her chest. Instinct took over. She ran, but every step felt fated, as if her path had already been chosen. Doors blurred past on either side, each wrong, each leading somewhere she dared not go. A voice called her name, distant and urgent, but she did not answer.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The corridor twisted. Angles folded in on themselves, floor and walls spiraling in dizzying loops. She pressed her eyes shut, stumbling as her hands grasped smooth stone that offered no purchase. Beneath the chaos, a faint order persisted—a quiet pulse, a thread of clarity just out of reach. She clung to it with the desperation of one drowning. With each breath, the distortion eased, and at last her feet found solid ground.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The familiar scent of candles, parchment, and ink filled her senses. Xayla steadied her shaking breath. Opening her eyes, she found herself in the castle library. Light filtered through a stained glass window high above, painting the floor in shifting mosaics. Her father stood nearby, back turned, shoulders rigid beneath his robes.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Dizzy and disoriented, her gaze drifted upward to the window. It depicted Caelon, Goddess of Mind, robed in sapphire and gold, her serene face aglow in the evening sun. If she tilted her head just so, a single ray broke through the glass and seemed to spill from the goddess’s outstretched fingertips. The light traced a path through the dusty air and pooled at her feet—and for just a moment, it felt as though wisdom herself was reaching out to touch her.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Are you listening to me, Xayla?!” Father whipped around.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She jumped, attention snapping back to him. She had let her mind wander too far, lost in the shifting patterns of light as she gave her last answer.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
He glared at her. “Oh, by the—were you Foretelling again?” His voice was equal parts exasperation and worry.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“No, Father! I—”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“—Quiet with your lies, girl.” He seized her hand and dragged her behind him, grip firm and impatient. “Sage Amaran will know how best to handle you.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The memory shifted. She was smaller still, her hand swallowed in his. The world felt too large, the halls too bright. He all but dragged her along, robes trailing behind. Sage Amaran waited at the end of the hall, his eyes warm but sharp. Xayla relaxed somewhat as she was handed over. The Sage’s expression stiffened as he turned to Father.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“My King,” Sage Amaran said, bowing his head low.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
King Gaillard turned to Amaran as he released her hand, his voice clipped and formal. “She’s been at it again, Amaran. Sullying her mind with Foretelling whilst neglecting her studies. She thinks herself clever, but she’s only cheating herself. I would have her understand the difference. Show her why this is <i>not</i> the path to Mind.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Amaran regarded her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. At last, he nodded, folding his hands into his sleeves. “Of course, Your Grace. I will see to it.” He then turned to Xayla, gaze softening. “Come, child,” he said, voice gentle but firm. “You need not fear correction. We all stumble as we learn to walk. But wisdom is not found in shortcuts, nor in answers borrowed from elsewhere. Let us see what you truly know, and let us build upon that together.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
They stepped through a doorway, and the world blurred at the edges. Xayla blinked. The hallway faded—replaced by the dim, familiar confines of her study. She stumbled, ducking behind a bookcase, and felt the faint, sweet-sour taste of nightshade tea lingering on her tongue. Embarrassment burned in her chest. Was she—was this that moment just after her meeting with Taetus and Sage Amaran?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
At the time, she had blacked out and remembered nothing. Now, though, her awareness seeped into those crevices—filling gaps she hadn’t known existed, as if reclaiming that blank space.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She raised a hand to her eyes and turned it over. After the vertigo of the last few visions—memories?—this sudden clarity came almost as a shock. She flexed her fingers, pressed her palm to her chest, and felt her breath rise and fall. This moment felt real. Grounded. Solid. Wholly her own.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She took a moment to pause and reflect. What connected these memories? That was obvious—some part of her mind was always Foretelling. Well, not exactly. Foretelling required constant expenditure of magic, and she wasn’t always sustaining it. Rather, it was as if she’d carved out a part of her mind for just that purpose—a part that thought in the same way she had as a child. Always guessing as to what lay ahead, reaching for answers without stopping to understand the <i>why</i>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Ugh. Foretelling—how foolish. She remembered the silly pranks she’d played as a child, the shortcuts and clever tricks. Letting her intuition be guided by magic, building haphazardly on whatever structure she could find. As a girl, she’d used it to dive into topics far beyond her level, just to get a feel what might be interesting. She learned much that way, but her understanding was flimsy at best—propped up by the thinnest twigs and branches.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Very unlike the solid trunk of wisdom that Amaran insisted she cultivate. Her ideas back then—grand and brilliant as they were—were as much fantasy as insight. Perhaps they belonged to a more innocent world, but not this one.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
So… had she slipped into Foretelling that day with the nightshade tea? It made sense—altered state, on edge, so sharply reminded of her youthful folly. Was that why her awareness felt so jumbled and scattered? At the time, she had simply blamed the tea, but—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Retreating voices below stirred her mind to the… present?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Tentatively, she cracked one eye open and found herself back in the cabin with Shesan. She closed it again, slipping once more into her study. The dissonance left her reeling. She shook her head, struggling to stay anchored in the vision. As she did, her mother’s locket caught on her blouse and drew her attention. She untangled it, then turned it over in her palm, tracing the etching inside. Unbidden, tears welled in her eyes.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No—ridiculous. She was long past grieving. That was ages ago! She banished the thought. It was just the tea—the nightshade was getting to her. She needed to rest. And she needed to figure out what Taetus was up to with with Amaran. If she couldn’t—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Wait—no. She wasn’t back <i>then</i>. She was <i>now</i>. She was… she was…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her mind swirled with a tempest of thought and emotion. Yet with quiet determination, she weathered the storm, anchoring herself in the… present. She lay asleep on Shesan’s lap—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
But also, she was here, in her study. And in the library, the concert hall, and the corridor of her mind—all at once. Yet, somehow, none of them simultaneously? She was Xayla, Queen of Avendal… but she was more than that. She was—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Pain</i>. Visceral. Sharp. Nausea twisted through her. Vertigo. She floated, suspended in a bubble spun from her own thoughts. The pain was hers, yet not hers alone.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She was the pain of a thousand lives lived, a thousand choices made, and countless regrets unspoken. She was the pain of a world that had been, and the pain of another yearning to be. She was the pain of a mother who had lost her child, of a daughter who had lost her mother, and of a people who had lost their way.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She was the pain of a goddess who had been forgotten, and the promise of a new dawn. She was the pain of a fallen hero, and the strength to rise again. She was the pain of a shattered kingdom, and the hope it might be rebuilt.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She was the pain of dreams crushed, and the will to dream again. The pain of a heart broken, and the love that could heal it. The pain of a lost soul, and the light that could guide it home. The pain of a long journey just begun, and the promise of a future yet to be written.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She was <i>Xayla</i>—yet she was more than that. She was the embodiment all that had been, all that was, and…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
All that… she had been… she was…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She blacked out, losing herself to the Void.
</span>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>
“I shall be a great queen!” Xayla moaned, her voice full of blissful abandon.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“A great queen…” Anli echoed, her voice dreamy and content.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“My people will love me, for caring and providing for them, and giving them all the secrets of the past!”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Mmmmhmm, yes.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I will conquer the world with technology and innovation! I will make the Lorekeepers look like schoolchildren!”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Uhhhuhh, mmmm, yeah… yeah…”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I will deliver all of Avendal unto an age of untold peace and prosperity! I will… Anli, are you listening?” She glanced down at the other woman.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Anli had fallen asleep.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And Xayla was…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Oh. Oh wow.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She blushed as she untangled their legs. <i>Wow.</i> She had never done anything like this before. She had thought about it plenty, sure—especially when Anli was alone with her in the bath, but…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She collapsed onto the bed beside the other woman, hands pressed to her chest.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No more nightshade, she resolved. Not for a long time, at least. And always in moderation.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She pressed her palms to her cheeks. Heat radiated from them, fierce and intense. The room spun as she struggled to get her bearings. She shut her eyes and curled tighter against the other woman, desperate to escape from the world. Anli’s warmth and steady breathing grounded her, soothing the chaos within.
</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>
<i>Are you alright, Xayla? I’m still here if you need me.</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla stirred awake. She was… sleeping after the banquet? Had she been dreaming?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Anli?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Yeah?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla breathed a sigh of relief. Anli was still there. She turned and—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No, Sera? Sera was there, and she was crying.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Oh, Sera… I’m sorry,” Xayla said. “I just woke up from a dream, and—”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“No, I get it. You still love her. You miss her,” the girl said quietly.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“No, it’s not like that!” Xayla sat up, her heart racing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“It’s okay.” Sera climbed out of bed and pulled on her robe, pausing only to smooth her hair and wipe her eyes. “It’s my fault, Your Grace. I don’t know what I was expecting.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She winced as the girl left, then pulled the covers up to her shoulders, bracing against the night’s chill. Burying her face in a pillow, she groaned into the silence.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Xayla? It’s okay. Try to relax.</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She sat up straight. Wait—was that—“Shesan?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No answer.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She waited a moment longer, then tried again. “Shesan? Are you there? Is this real?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Nothing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She shivered, suddenly feeling very alone. She glanced around the empty room. The fire had burned low, its faint light casting flickering shadows across the walls. Only the crackle of embers broke the silence. She noticed the balcony door stood ajar, letting cool night air drift in. Moonlight bathed everything in a soft glow, illuminating dust motes suspended in the air.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She stood, slipped into a silk robe, and wrapped it tightly around herself before stepping onto the balcony. She drew a few slow, calming breaths, and let the tension ease from her body. Eyes closed, she let the breeze wash over her. Cool. Refreshing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“It’s just a bad trip,” she muttered, clinging to the hope that saying it aloud might make it true. “Nothing I haven’t been through before. I just need to… find my way back to… uhm…”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her gaze drifted to the moon. Its blood-red sheen burned across the sky, leeching all color from the world. Horror seized her. Her knees buckled, and she collapsed to the floor, clutching her robe to her chest.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Xayla?” another voice called out from back towards her bed. Deep. Powerful. Masculine.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla snapped her head around, breath catching as she recognized the figure sitting at the edge of her bed. The dark-haired Akhari man, broad-shouldered and regal, watched her with a quiet intensity, his sharp eyes strangely gentle in the moonlight.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Xayla?” he repeated, voice low and steady. “Come back to bed. You’re worrying me.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Memories of that terrible vision—the blood-red moon, the sandstorm, and the tower of bones—flashed through her mind. That piercing gaze, violating her very soul. Azahndor, crowned and terrible, looming above the world.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
But now, that gaze was different. Concerned. Almost… tender. She felt utterly seen, as if no secret could hide from those amber eyes. Something <i>very</i> uncomfortable stirred within her.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She swallowed hard and turned back outside. “I… I just needed some air,” she managed. The moon’s pale light washed over her—no trace of red. She stared, struggling to make sense of it. Was this another vision? If so, it felt as real as anything she had ever known. She stole a glance over her shoulder. Should she be wary of this specter?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“My love, you are safe with me,” the Exiled King, Champion of the Enemy, said softly. “Whatever troubles you, you don’t have to face it alone.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She glanced back at him, aghast. <i>My love?</i> The words struck deep, their incongruity threatening to shatter her mind.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Try as she might, she could not hold his gaze. Those eyes—so intense. She turned back to the balcony, shaking her head. For a long moment, she sat there, uncertain what to do next.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She let out a heavy sigh. Whatever this vision was, she could at least try to glean some understanding from it. “My love?” she tried weakly. “Remind me again—how did we get here?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Silence. When she looked back, he was gone. The bed was empty, and the room quiet save for the faint crackle of the hearth.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla sagged as a heavy fog pressed in at the edges of her mind. She wasn’t sure she could take much more of this.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Probably best to just get back to bed and ride it out, she decided. But as she stood, a voice called from behind.
</span>
<span>
“You’re going to come down sick like that,” Nira said, stepping from the shadows of the balcony into the room. Xayla turned and gawked at her. She wore her usual attire, hair pulled back in a tight bun.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla dared not speak. Her eyes burned, tears welling at the edges. She blinked them back, struggling to refocus. This couldn’t be real. Nira was gone—mourned and lost. This was just another vision, another trick of the mind.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Nira approached, hand outstretched. Xayla shook her head, clutching her hair. “No! You’re not <i>real</i>! You’re not—”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She froze, lifeless and dull, as a cold wind swept in from nowhere, blowing ashes into her face. The ghost of Nira crumbled before her.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla drew in a deep breath, then <i>screamed</i>—defiant, her face flushed with anger and frustration. “I’m not afraid of you!” she shouted into the empty room. “I’m not afraid of any of this! I will <i>not</i> be broken by these petty tricks!”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The world quaked and shuddered at her outcry. Waves rippled outward from her in defiance of all reason. The walls warped and bent, shadows writhing as if unsure of their source. Ashes on the floor whirled up in a sudden vortex, then danced and flit about the room, swirling in tune with her every thought.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A dizzying rush swept through her—fear and excitement mingling in her chest. Tentatively, she reached out with her will. The world shifted in response, wavering and blurring at the edges as she focused, as if waiting for her to decide what came next.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She drew a shaky breath, pulse pounding. Whatever this was—be it dream or vision—she could shape it. She reached out with her intent, and the boundaries of the room dissolved into flux. In an instant, she was suspended in a space that was at once infinite and intimate, uncertain yet inviting. It mirrored her mind, but was shaped by something deeper still—something that brushed at the edge of divinity, pressed between the world of gods and the world of thought.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She drifted for a while through this space that was not space, struggling to hold on to any part of it for more than a fleeting instant. Color, sound, imagination, and logic all bled together, until almost everything she knew slipped away—replaced by a vast, swirling tapestry of raw possibility that encompassed the whole of her awareness.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
What felt like an eternity later, a haze of half-remembered dreams, tangled emotions, and flickering echoes of memory coalesced into something vaguely Xayla-shaped. Here it floated, unmoored and without direction, save for one salient thread: six fragments of Mind pulsed with serene, luminous clarity from deep within. That certainty anchored her—not just to herself, but to something vast and eternal. Without it, there could be no “I.” Pondering this led to the next natural question—where was the rest?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The thought itself seemed to tug at the fabric of this place—and then Xayla was moving along with it, drawn forward by invisible threads of intent.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her awareness settled on solid ground, and her body took shape around it. A forest scene unfolded around her—ancient, tangled, overgrown. She knew this place—The Wandering Weald, or some echo of it? Yet beautiful as it was, something felt unmistakably wrong. It was as if the sun had set on this land, even though daylight still lingered. The air hung impossibly thick with a hazy fog, and motes of luminous shadows flitted between the trees. The world itself seemed to hum with a strange, persistent dread.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She pushed aside the otherworldly unease. Somewhere—a memory insisted—a fragment of Mind or Spirit was hidden here. She studied the scene. Ahead and to the right, a shadowy figure lingered—a young man, familiar yet strange.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla narrowed her eyes—she’d seen him before, hadn’t she? As if in answer, he turned to her and laughed, then blew a single long note from a reed and slipped into the forest. Xayla chased after him, ducking through a hollow log into a clearing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She emerged from the natural tunnel into a grotto and searched around, but the man was gone. At the center, a stone pedestal jutted from the earth, draped in moss and vines. Crumbling archways and shattered columns ringed the clearing—ancient remnants of a forgotten civilization, their surfaces worn smooth by centuries. She focused on the pedestal and saw a sword embedded at its heart, gleaming with cold, blue light.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her breath caught. Was that—the Blade of Reckoning? She stepped closer, but before she could reach the pedestal, night fell in an instant. Shadows thickened, coiling and writhing as if alive. An unnatural roar shattered the silence, echoing through the grotto. From the darkness, a hulking creature erupted—a shifting mass of nightmare, all lanky limbs and shadowy tendrils, claws gouging deep furrows in the mossy earth. She staggered back, heart pounding, as the beast loomed over her, blotting out what little light remained. It lunged. She barely had time to raise her arms before it crashed down upon her—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A moment passed. She glanced up, genuinely surprised that she had not been mauled to death. Instead, a wild, fierce wolf had intercepted the nightmare, tearing into it with claws, snarls, and snapping jaws. Each attack shredded pieces off the creature, dissolving it into smoke and shadow until nothing remained. Heart pounding, she watched as the last wisps faded into the gloom and the faint wrong-light returned to the grotto.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla breathed a sigh of relief—only for the wolf to turn on her, snarling, eyes aglow. Instinctively, she reached for her magic and sent out a Soothing pulse, humming a soft, sweet melody. Green light shimmered between them, and for a moment, the wolf stilled.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She relaxed, but the wolf stayed tense, eyes fixed on her. It was a wild creature, untamed and fierce—but… No, there was something familiar about it. She kept the Soothing pulses steady and, after a moment’s hesitation, reached out a hand. The wolf leaned in and sniffed her fingers with a similar degree of caution, then stepped closer and nuzzled her palm.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No. She knew that presence. As the wolf’s muzzle brushed her skin, she <i>felt</i> it—unmistakable. “Ari?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Playful laughter—high, echoing, and mischievous—filled the clearing. “Awwww,” came an unnaturally tinny, distorted female voice. Both Xayla and the wolf turned. A strange, squat impish woman with glowing red hair floated above the ground, her black-and-white form a stark reflection of this twilit place. “Are you lost, little queen?” the imp asked, mischief in her eyes. “I can help with that!”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Before she could react, the imp’s hair <i>snaked</i> out, coiling into a fist that seized her and yanked her off the ground. The world spun, colors bleeding together, and her awareness slipped back into darkness.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Through sheer willpower, Xayla clung to consciousness, only to find herself cast loose once more—formless in the Void, carried along by unseen currents. There was no up or down here, no time or place—only motion and flashes of possibility: childhood memories, other lives, fragments of Avalia’s ancient sorrow. She tried to hold onto the vision of the wolf-that-was-Ari and the impish woman, but it slipped away, dissolving into the endless sea.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Desperate not to lose herself again, Xayla reached for the current of power that had brought her there. But the harder she tried, the more it slipped away, like sand through her fingers. The memory of the grotto blurred at the edges and receded from her mind, leaving her feeling small, helpless, and adrift. Each attempt to assert her will only scattered her focus further, as if the very act of reaching kept it just out of grasp.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A quiet determination pulsed within her. She refused to give up. Gathering what fragments of herself she could hold onto, she anchored her awareness to the steady pulsing of Mind. Letting go of the need for control, she surrendered to the Void and listened for the faintest echo of the Celestial Light that might lead her onward.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her vision shifted again. She was a child, standing in a grand cathedral. Three opulent gemstones—red, blue, and green—floated before her, each etched with the symbols of the Celestial Sovereigns. Ahead, a stone door rumbled open, spilling divine golden light. The Sanctern beckoned. She started forward, but—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A sinister laugh echoed behind her. She froze, vision blurring. Then in a rush, she was riding horseback with Nira, fleeing through the night. Clutching a dark blue ocarina, she tossed it to a familiar boy in green as they raced past. She turned back to Nira, heart pounding with love, fear, grief, and longing—then, overwhelmed by emotion, faded once more into the Void.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Brief. Sudden. Disorienting. She had no sense of agency or control in that vision—she was merely a passenger, swept along by the currents of her subconscious. That ocarina, once a gift from Nira and a symbol of their bond, now felt like a weight, dragging her deeper into the Void. She let the thought of it slip away and clung instead to the feeling of Nira’s steady presence—her anchor in the storm. With that, her thoughts began to settle.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Nira—that was really her! A fire sparked deep within, rekindling parts of Xayla’s soul she had long abandoned. Nira—she had to be out there somewhere. Xayla clung to the memories of her guardian, her dearest friend, reaching for that bond and willing herself to follow it—determined not to lose her way.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A new vision took shape. She stood at the foot of a massive, circular clockwork gate, its gears turning and snapping into place with a slow, resonant rhythm. Colors of Void shimmered across its metalic surface—teals, purples, violets, and blues. Runes etched with <i>meaning</i> glowed on the gear teeth, and the symbols of the Celestial Sovereigns were carved radially at each point of a triangle. At the center, the likeness of the Sanctern gleamed with golden light, with musical notes arcing between the three symbols.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Nira stood beside her, humming a melody. Xayla found a magical golden harp in her hands and joined in, following the ethereal notes that danced across the gate under Nira’s lead. Their song intertwined, weaving through the air and building to a shimmering crescendo. The gate opened, revealing a stairway of light and magic—and then an explosion shattered the moment. Stunned, they turned toward the sound. A flamboyant man in white burst from the rubble at the far end of a bridge, brandishing a Soulsteel weapon made of shadow and malice that drank in the light around it. Nira rushed to meet him, her naginata blazing with divine radiance, a perfect counterpoint to her foe’s blade.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
As the weapons met, a shockwave rippled outward. The air shimmered, and the ground warped beneath their feet, as if reality itself recoiled from the force of their clash.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
At the same time, she spotted Ari sprinting to their aid from across the gorge. A surge of hope, courage, and defiance welled up within her. The harp’s power resonated in her hands, swelling with the harmony of the Gatesong. In a flash of certainty and insight, she sent the instrument to him in a beam of golden light. Ari, startled, caught the gift and stowed it away before dashing in to join the fray. Ahead, the fight raged—Nira countered the man’s every move with her naginata, each strike punctuated by sparks and bursts of magic.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The white-clad man pressed his attack with a flurry of blows, forcing Nira to the ground. In that instant, Ari leapt to her defense, drawing the enemy’s focus and giving her a chance to retreat. She seized Xayla’s hand, and together they dashed through the open gate. Nira collapsed it behind them in a burst of magic, sealing their escape.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Everything unraveled into a vast, shifting horizon, dissolving into mist and color. Xayla was swept along a river not of water, but of thought and current—its surface shimmering with memories and possibilities. The river branched and forked, flowing into past, future, and stranger places still—many streams twisting back onto themselves and disappearing into the aether, or flowing away in their own diverging direction.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Around her, echoes and reflections of the great river coursed in crisscrossing lines, nearing but never quite touching—each carrying glimpses of other selves and other lives. Some of those alternate selves turned toward her, the same confusion she felt mirrored in their eyes. The sensation was dizzying; she drifted forward, backward, and sideways all at once. Everything blurred into a tapestry of light and shadow, wholly impossible to grasp in its entirety. Her mind strained to follow even a single current, and even that threatened to sweep her away.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“STOP!” she cried out, the thought ringing out like a command—her desperate attempt to pause what felt like an inevitable, predetermined sequence. For an instant, everything hung suspended, the universe itself awaiting her next move.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The chaos and confusion ebbed into stillness, dissolving until she stood in a familiar grey landscape—dull, featureless, silent. Relief mingled with exhaustion in her chest. She needed help; she could not do this alone.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“…Shesan?” she called out meekly.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A figure emerged on the horizon—light tan skin, cropped red hair catching the pale, colorless light. As the figure approached, Xayla recognized the familiar posture and the cut of her clothes, yet doubt lingered. Was it really Shesan, or—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“It’s me,” Shesan replied, as if reading Xayla’s thoughts. Her voice carried clear and strong despite the vast distance. “Don’t worry, I’m here.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla released a tension she hadn’t realized she was holding onto. The distance between them lingered, yet seemed to recede as Shesan drew near—a welcome presence in the emptiness.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Thank you,” Xayla said, voice tired and thin. “I’m not sure I can take much more of that.” She shivered and strained, trying to focus. She could feel the weight of each and every word as she spoke, as if they were being etched into the very fabric of this place. Phantom thoughts floated and drifted around her—unsourced from her mind, yet insistent they belonged to her—and they would, she knew, if only she made the simplest gesture to accept them as such.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I’m not sure what’s real anymore,” she admitted, scrunching up her face, somehow managing to keep track of it all at once. “I don’t even know which thoughts are mine,” she confessed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She paused, pressing a finger to her chin. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say a foreign entity was writing my thoughts for me. Literally writing them—as if they were being etched into my mind one letter at a time.” She waved a hand. “No, wait. The fabric of this place. Not my mind. Wait… uhm…”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She glanced around. There it was again—a presence, lingering, watching, as if waiting for her to falter, just for an instant.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Uh, yeah, Xayla, you probably shouldn’t do that,” Shesan said, concern flickering across her face. “I would recommend against grafting random fragments of the Void onto your mind.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Uhh?” Xayla said, flummoxed. “I didn’t realize I was doing that.” She forced her mind clear, picturing it as an empty, contained space that she could control, willing the stubborn thought-motes to fall silent. Even then, yet another thought stream floated past nearby, insistent it was hers. But as she inspected it, she found it made little sense—and as she willed her mind to focus, her own thoughts took root, dissolving the foreign ones into nothingness. It was almost as if—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“No, it’s okay,” Shesan said. “You’re not crazy. If it helps, you can imagine yourself as a fictional character in a story that is being written around you. But this is real. You are really experiencing this.”
</span>
<br><br>
“…How?” was all Xayla could manage as she tried and failed to manifest a single coherent thought of her own accord. But the harder she focused, the more she frayed at the edges, until at last she relaxed and let a few thought-motes settle—this time, scrutinizing each one to be sure it was truly her own. “I mean, how could I possibly reconcile those ideas? How could anything be real if I’m just a character in a story?”
<br><br>
<span>
“It’s complicated,” Shesan said. “Observe.” She swept her hand out, and the world flickered in response—scenes shifting as if drawn, erased, and redrawn by invisible ink. Xayla watched, uncertain. “Try it,” Shesan insisted. Xayla mimicked her, at first to no effect, but Shesan guided her motions, their hands moving in tandem. Then Xayla felt it—a thread of intent tugging at the fabric of this place. Shesan yielded control, and with a gesture, Xayla guided it, weaving a tapestry of thought that settled in her mind, and became real.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She the turned her attention to the aether, trying to conjure a scene as Shesan had. Reaching out with her mind, she sensed threads within the Void—waiting, expectant. She focused on one, shimmering faintly gold, and drew it toward herself.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Almost, but not quite,</i> she thought. She waved her hand in a motion she had seen Shesan do, unraveling part of the tapestry she had just woven, then again to banish the stray Void-strands that surged in to fill the empty space before they could solidify. She closed her eyes and let instinct take over as she decided what went in that space. It responded to her will, and she felt color return to the world around her. Life and breath filled her lungs as she took in a deep, calming breath.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Good, good!” Shesan said encouragingly. “Alright, now you just need to go somewhere familiar.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla shook her head, frustration creeping in. “I’ve already tried that.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“No,” Shesan said abruptly, a hint of amusement in her voice. She raised both hands, palms out, as if to say ‘wait.’ “Somewhere… <i>familiar</i>,” she said, putting emphasis on that last word. Xayla sensed what she meant, but couldn’t quite put it to words herself. “Did you get that?” Shesan asked.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She wanted to say ‘no,’ but that wasn’t true. “Yes,” she admitted, resting her palm on her chin. “But I don’t know what that <i>means</i>.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Beautiful!</i> Shesan’s thoughts echoed in her mind. <i>Perfect. Just like that. Remember, you’ve already faced the worst of it. Probably.</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Not reassuring,</i> Xayla thought.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Shesan ignored her. <i>Xayla, you’re trying to get back to yourself. Somewhere you can’t reach right now. What are you missing?</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Oh,” Xayla said, opening her eyes and returning to the empty landscape. “Right now, I’d just like to be home in my study, with a warm fire and a good book.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Okay,” Shesan said firmly, as if to settle the matter. “So go there.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Really?” Xayla asked, a hint of skepticism in her voice. “It’s just that simple?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Try it,” Shesan insisted. “I’ll still be here if you get lost again.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla obeyed, closing her eyes. The world shifted. The familiar weight of a book settled in her hands, and she felt the gentle warmth of a hearth on her skin, carrying with it the sharp scents of burning pine. Beyond the walls, thunder rumbled, followed by the soft patter of rain against the windows. She opened her eyes with a gasp. Was she finally home in her study?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No—something was off. The shelves were wrong, and the view from the window showed a landscape she didn’t recognize. She glanced down at the book in her hands. The words twisted and danced, refusing to settle into anything she could read. She blinked and tried again, but the writing only shifted further, alive and restless beneath her gaze.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She closed the book shut and turned it over. The cover was ornate, embossed with gold leaf and intricate designs. Across the front, in bold, elegant script, read the title: “Legacy of the Goddess.” At the center, her own likeness gazed back—strange, yet unmistakable—surrounded by those of Shesan, Null, Taetus, Ari, Izu, and their Veilwyrd teams.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A chill ran through her, and she gently set the book back on the shelf, hands trembling.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She paused, hesitating. Experimentally, she let her mind unfocus and her thoughts diffuse as she called on the magic of Foretelling. Threads of unwoven possibility stretched out around her, each one a potential future. Shadow selves took different routes through the library, each one making a different choice. She could see and feel herself in each of them as they picked up a book and began reading—some intrigued, some hopeful and resolute, others lost and confused. The library itself shifted and changed with each unmade choice, the contents of its shelves rearranging themselves in response to her thoughts. At last, the process seemed to settle on a single, stable path that drew in and enveloped every other possibility, leaving her with a sense of clarity and purpose. A single book on a shelf nearby shimmered faintly.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She strode over and reached for the volume. Its cover depicted that of a great winged magical fish adrift in a vast, cosmic ocean. Its skin shimmered with the colors of Void, shifting and rippling as if alive. The title read: “The Queen’s Odyssey.”
</span>
<img src="/img/the-queens-odyssey.png" alt="The Queen's Odyssey" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:100%;"/>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>
On a meta-level, <i>The Queen’s Odyssey</i> was less a story and more a metaphysical reflection of the shifting line between fiction, dream, and reality in which Xayla found herself entangled. She read a book that almost—but-not-quite—told her story: searching through endless volumes in a library, each shaped by her memories of what existence had been like before her voyage through the endless sea. The scenes within its pages never truly happened; instead, the book acknowledged its own fictional nature, aware of its place in a larger, more complex whole. This self-awareness unsettled her, leaving her feeling adrift and, if such were possible, questioning even more what was real and what was merely imagined.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The dialogue, too, was self-aware. Xayla and Zephyros—an entity who introduced himself to her as the custodian of this place—questioned the strangeness of their meeting. Zephyros explained to her that their current forms existed only in the book’s margins. Her search for meaning in the face of this baffling revelation was met with only elusive answers, further blurring the line between her status as a reader of the book she was holding and as a character within its pages. Zephyros further conveyed that the library itself was a metaphor for her journey, with its stories and identities contained therein uncannily conscious of their own artifice. In light of this knowledge, Xayla found herself pondering what it would mean to exist as a fictive within the mind of an author, yet still possess agency and selfhood as a very-real fragment of personality within that mind.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
As she read on, however, any sense of control slipped away. She reached for answers, but their meaning scattered, as if refracted by the book’s ever-shifting pages. The experience left her suspended in the perhaps the strangest liminal space she was capable of imagining, but much better equipped this time to make sense of it. The book’s narrative, like the library itself, was a reflection of her own mind—a place where the boundaries between reality and fiction blurred, and where she was free to explore the depths of her own conscious experience. But whether she was ready to face those depths was another question entirely.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Taken as a whole, this story-that-was-not-a-story was less about any particular narrative, and more about her uneasy relationship with a book that was as self-aware as she was—summarizing scenes that never-quite-happened as she didn’t-quite-read them, until that self-aware process finally settled on a single, stable fixed point that her mortal mind could grasp. From there, she wandered on, the tale drifting with her, until at last she grew weary and longed for something more familiar on this strange and existentially terrifying odyssey to find her way back home.
</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>
“What. The fick,” Xayla said flatly, snapping the book shut and placing it back on the shelf.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She blinked, the world around her shimmering with the unreality of dream. A gripping fear nagged at the back of her mind—was this construction stable, or was she just a fleeting thought within it? Terrifying. Yet as time progressed and she did not flick away in an instant or dissolve into a scattered haze of semi-lucid awareness, she pushed the thought aside and decided to look around.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Though the space felt familiar, this library-that-was-not-her-study stretched vast and strange, its shelves receding into infinity, each book humming with its own presence. She did not need to read them to sense what the volumes contained. The weight of her own reality pressed in, and she felt watched.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Who’s there?” she called out meekly, already knowing the answer. Thunder crashed outside in reply, followed by a long, low, echoing call from somewhere far above—mournful and ancient. It reverberated through the library, shaking the shelves and sending dust motes swirling.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She eased over to the window for a better look. Beyond the glass stretched a vast, cosmic ocean, the island beneath her adrift in its endless expanse. Overhead, the sky poured out in a swirling tempest of stars and nebulae, their colors shifting and blending in ways that defied earthly logic. Chromatic rain fell in shimmering sheets, casting the landscape in a kaleidoscope of hues.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A hush settled over the library as she waited for the next event in the inevitable progression. The air thickened, as even the dust motes paused to listen. Somewhere, a ladder creaked along its rails, followed by the soft, whispering sigh of wind through a place that should have been sealed from the weather outside.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla’s skin prickled. She turned, and on the second floor—between two shelves where a moment ago there had been only shadow—a figure emerged. Tall and androgynous, draped in a robe of shifting colors: indigo, pearl, and the iridescent hues of a stormlit sea. Their face was both familiar and utterly alien, Caelydri-like yet not, with eyes as deep as the Void Between Worlds.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Welcome, daughter of Avalia,” the figure intoned, voice resonant and layered, as if a chorus spoke through a single mouth. “You have come a long way to find yourself in my library.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She cocked her head, eyeing him skeptically. Hadn’t they done this part already? “Zephyros, right?” she asked, uncertain.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The figure smiled, revealing a row of strawlike teeth. “I have been called many things—Zephyros, the Songfish, Dreamer of the Deep. Call me what you wish. I am simply… <i>The One Who Waits Between</i>.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Again, that long, low call echoed through the library, reverberating off the shelves and sending a shiver down her spine. Outside, the Songfish’s vast, cosmic form shimmered—scales and feathers rippling like water in the shifting cosmic light.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Uh huh</i>, Xayla thought, feeling the weight behind those words. Definitely not suspicious. She crossed her arms, trying to project an air of confidence she didn’t feel. “Sorry—what is this place, exactly? Why am I here, and how do I get home? —Not trying to be rude or anything. I’m just questioning what the point of it is. I think we both know how this part of the story goes.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zephyros’ gaze deepened, and Xayla felt herself laid bare—every memory, every fear, every hope exposed to a mind far more ancient and vast than her own. “You are here because you seek. Because you question. Because you are not content to be written, but wish to write yourself.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She stared at him, incredulous. “Okay? But that doesn’t explain anything.” She raised an upturned palm. “Setting aside for a moment the question of what’s real—” She pressed her hands to her temples and groaned. “Look—just give me a straight answer. Am I dead? Is this the afterlife?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zephyros’ smile turned gentle, almost pitying. “No, child. You are not dead yet. You stand closer to the threshold than most ever have, but you may yet find your way back.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Something in the way he said that unsettled her. Knowing—at least on an intellectual, cerebral level—that she would escape was one thing; feeling mortal fear and soul-piercing doubt in the moment was quite another. Her mind raced, grasping for context. She summoned up memories of the Void, the River of Time, and the fragments of herself scattered through dream, memory, and legend. All of it felt both ages past and mere moments ago. Now, before her, stood an entity who claimed to be the custodian of this place—a being who existed between worlds, between dreams and reality, who had been waiting for her arrival.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Dreamer of the Deep’s voice echoed as if from a thousand distant shores as he continued on. “You are not the first traveler here, nor will you be the last. This place is neither library nor sanctuary, but a confluence—where the tides of your longing, your shadow, and your memory converge. Each volume is a vessel adrift on endless currents, its contents shifting with the gaze of the reader, all destinations unknown and unknowable until enumerated. What you seek is both the map and the sea. If you would return to your life, you must discern which current is yours—and surrender to its pull, uncertain where it leads.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The words resonated with a strange, undeniable truth. She felt herself drawn in, the entity’s presence pressing at the edges of her mind, attempting to fill the space behind her eyes with wise-sounding but ultimately hollow words. Xayla did as she had in the Void—blanking her thoughts, forcing the shadows out. “I’m not sure I understand,” she said through gritted teeth, patience wearing thin, voice steady despite the uncertainty she felt within. “I thought I was supposed to be the one writing my story.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Outside, the Songfish’s form flickered, scales and feathers and stormclouds rippling across his skin. Zephyros spoke in tune with its mournful cry. “As you wish, godling. But know this: the Void is hungry. It devours those who wander too far from their ordained paths.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The library trembled. Books shuddered on their shelves, pages fluttering as if caught in a gale. Zephyros vanished, his form unraveling into a storm of wings, eyes, and scales that swirled in a shadowy maelstrom, filling the space. His voice echoed from every corner, layered and immense: “Choose, Xayla. Will you be the dreamer, or the dream?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She stood firm and defiant before the Voidspawn. “Neither,” she hissed, voice steady. “I will be <i>me</i>. And I will not be consumed by your games or riddles. I <i>will</i> find my way back, and I will not be broken by you, nor by this place.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A great and terrible laughter rang out—joyful, mournful, full of bliss and sorrow. Shadows coalesced, dripping from the walls and twisting into monstrous forms. “Then swim, Xayla. Swim for your life!”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The air pressed in, thick with the presence of Voidspawn. She reached for her magic and summoned a tide of water to drive back her assailants. Panic clawed at her. She turned and ran as shadows snapped at her heels, bolting out the door, down the halls, and into the tempest outside.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The world twisted as she fled. The sky churned with impossible colors, lightning forking silently across a horizon that bent and folded in on itself. Laughter echoed behind her. Zephyros’s voice, along with a chorus of every fear and doubt she’d ever known, mingled together with the howling wind.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Run if you wish, little queen,” it taunted, its words slithering through her mind like eels in the storm. “You can’t escape yourself. You can’t outrun what you are.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The ground beneath her feet buckled and warped—marble shifting to mud, then slick, glassy stone. She pressed on—lungs burning, heart pounding, terror clawing at her, feeling violated and desperate. She stumbled and nearly fell, but forced herself onward. Somewhere ahead, a faint golden glow pierced the gloom.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She burst through a tangle of brambles and stumbled into a clearing before an ancient shrine. The architecture was unmistakable—Lightsworn, without a doubt. Columns rose around her, carved with symbols she’d glimpsed in her visions. The door was engraved with the same runes as the gate she had seen before, with Nira at her side. Relief and awe mingled within. She traced the patterns with trembling fingers, only to realize she had no way to open it. The shrine stood silent, dormant.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Ah. Just in the nick of time—Her Grace, the Queen of Existential Dread!” Xayla startled to see none other than Seff step into the light with a slight bow, a crooked grin on his face and a coil of rope slung over one shoulder. He looked her up and down, then glanced past her into the roiling darkness. “Just one question. Is that seething mass of malice friend, or foe?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She tried to answer, but the Voidspawn’s looming presence at the edge of the clearing—swirling and shifting, eyes and mouths opening and closing in anticipation—left her speechless. Seff didn’t wait for an answer. He uncoiled the rope and, with a breath of shimmering chromatic mist, flicked it toward the entity. The rope sprang to life, writhing and twisting, lashing around the Voidspawn’s limbs and dragging it to the ground. The creature shrieked and struggled, but the bonds held—barely.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“That should buy us a minute or three,” he said, dusting his hands together and then wiping them on his coat. He glanced at Xayla, then at the gate. “I don’t suppose you have the key?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her mind raced. The melody from her vision—the Gatesong—rose unbidden to her lips. She hummed it with broken breaths, instinct guiding her more than memory. The runes on the shrine door pulsed with golden light in response. The door shuddered, then slowly rose open.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Together, they dashed through the threshold. Xayla ceased her song, and the door slammed shut behind them, sealing with a flash of radiant energy. Outside, the howls of The One Who Waits Between faded into the storm, a long, low wail echoing through the shrine and reverberating off the walls like a mournful dirge.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
For a long moment, they stood in the shrine’s gentle glow while Xayla caught her breath. Relief washed over her, then exhaustion and disbelief. She wasn’t home yet—but they were safe. For now.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She turned to the strange man, equal parts gratitude and apprehension.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
He spoke first, raising an eyebrow before she could voice the burning question on her mind. “Xayla, don’t take this the wrong way or anything, but I’ve been kicked through more Realms than I care to name, and even I wouldn’t have bet on you making a cameo in this scene.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She gawked at him, still trying to process everything that had just happened. A flat “What,” was all she could manage.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
He grinned, eyes twinkling with mischief. “I suppose I should introduce myself properly. As you have no doubt been informed, I am no mere minstrel in your employ.” He gave her a mock bow. “Seff, at your service—though others have far less polite names for me. For now, let’s just say I’m your unlikely tour guide through the narrative soup! Welcome to the Repository, Your Grace. I would say ‘try not to trip over any loose plot threads,’ but I do believe our friend outside is busy wrapping up the last of them.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Another long, low wail sounded outside. Xayla couldn’t be sure, but to her ears, it sounded like more of a groan. She glanced back at the man and started to speak, but then paused, holding up a finger. “So you are aware you’re a character in a story?” she asked, trying to keep her voice steady. “Or are you just another eidolon?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Oh, I’m definitely a character,” he said with a wink. “But to answer your question, no, I’m not a figment of your imagination. I’m a figment of the universe’s imagination—same as you. And while I’m being honest, I don’t belong in your story either. But I am a traveller of sorts, and I’ve come to find that the best way to get to know a place is to get lost in it! Just usually, not so literally.” He gave her a weak laugh. “I mean—who even names a place that? ‘The Wandering Weald’?” He shook his head incredulously.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Xayla crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow in open disbelief. “You expect me to believe you came from the Wandering Weald?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Do the words: ‘Pseudostable transnormal interplanar junction’ mean anything to you?” he asked plainly.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She frowned, shaking her head.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Let’s just say I’m not from around here,” he said with a simple shrug. “But I do know a thing or two about getting lost in the strangest of locales and then finding my way back out again. So while I’m here—and definitely not without other options other than to hope against hope that you hold the key to my escape—I’m going to help you find your way home!” He beamed at her with a false grin. “And who knows, perhaps we’ll both learn something along the way about the magic of friendship or some other trite nonsense.”
</span>
<br><br>
