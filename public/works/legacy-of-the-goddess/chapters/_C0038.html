<span>
Izu stood with the rest of the group, gazing out into sheer darkness.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
What they found just beyond the ritual chamber defied belief. If that had been impossibly vast, this new cavern dwarfed it entirely. The passage opened onto a natural ledge overlooking an abyss that seemed to have no bottom. And covering everything—the walls, the floor, pooled in stagnant lakes—was a substance that made his skin crawl just to look at.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
It seemed to move with a life of its own—a writing mass of deep crimson shot through with veins of sickly purple. Even from a distance, just the sight of it filled him with an overwhelming sense of wrongness.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Gazra had ventured closer than the others to inspect the substance. As he drew near, his face went pale and he staggered back, one hand flying to his mouth.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“What is that gunk?” Kellin asked, voice tight.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Nothing good,” Gazra replied hoarsely. “Best stay clear.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Link tried to approach the edge for a better look, but made it only a few steps before doubling over with retching sounds. The closer they got, the worse it became—waves of nausea and revulsion that seemed to emanate from the substance itself.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Stay back,” Izu ordered. “Whatever it is, best not to take any chances.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Agreed,” Jedal said as he spat onto the ground. “Cursed, I’d wager.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The group shuffled back towards the tunnel to Kith’raxis’s chamber. They’d need to find—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
He held up a hand as he heard footsteps and saw a light. The group came to a halt—all except Koja.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“’s just Ryn,” Koja said.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Izu glanced around and did a quick headcount. Sure enough…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Ryn rounded the corner carrying what appeared to be a makeshift lantern. She held it out in front of her as she jogged out to meet the group.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
"Neat. Where'd you find that?" Link asked.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Gazra grunted, also peering at the lantern with interest.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Ryn beamed. She turned the device around so they could see it better. It was simply buckler that had been dented backward, with some random bit of imbued metal fixed inside to provide light.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Clever,” Kellin said approvingly. “Quite resourceful.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Koja wordlessly walked up and past Ryn, back up the tunnel.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Koja?” Kellin called after her.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No reply. She simply continued on.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Jedal looked around at the others, mild concern on his face.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Err—probably she’s considering making more of these,” Ryn said, tossing the light source towards Link, who caught it. “I’ll help.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Me too,” Kellin said, falling in step behind them. She glanced back at the others as she went, offering a quick shrug to indicate she was just as clueless. “Just in case,” she added.
