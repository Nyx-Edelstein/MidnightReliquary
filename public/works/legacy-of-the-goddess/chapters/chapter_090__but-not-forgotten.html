<span>“Xayla?” came Sera’s voice. “It’s time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla took a deep breath and let it out slowly. Part of her was relieved—she’d been dreading this all day. For days, even. Nothing had brought her joy, knowing what lay ahead. A black stormcloud of despair loomed on the horizon, inching steadily closer. Unavoidable. Inevitable. Hiding in her study hadn’t slowed its approach or hastened what she knew was coming. She didn’t want to go through with it, yet she desperately wanted it to be over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She started to respond, but found herself at a loss for words. Instead, she stood and knocked back the last of her wine, then picked up the parcel on her desk and held it tightly to her chest. She settled for a simple nod.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sera stepped aside, and Xayla took the lead. The younger girl carried a brooch and a small flower. Xayla wanted to ask about their significance, but couldn’t bring herself to. She would learn soon enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They made their way out of the study, past the guards and down the hall. Footsteps echoed faintly against the walls, joined by the rustling of arms and armor as her detail fell in behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Step. Step. Step. Time inched forward at its own pace—inexorable and heedless of her plight. Every step was a chore. She wanted so badly for it to just be over, wished she could run away and hide somewhere until it was. But she knew that was ridiculous. She was Queen. She had to fulfill her duty. She had no choice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She tried not to dwell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At last they reached the castle antechamber. Xayla and her small entourage descended the stairs to join the gathered crowd. She scanned their faces. Few eyes met her own, but every pair of hands held <i>something</i>. She knew she wasn’t alone in her grief and apprehension, but somehow that made it worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She came to a stop and faced the exit, allowing the congregation to file in behind her. The magnificent stone doors drew open, and the High Priestess took up position at her right. Xayla met her eyes. The aging woman nodded solemnly. She returned the gesture, and together they led the procession forward.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And so they marched. Through the doorway. Across the gardens, bathed in the light of Nia above. Along the winding path to the western edge of the castle grounds, and finally atop the knoll where the ceremonial pyre had been prepared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They came to a halt and the procession fanned out to either side. Xayla passed her parcel to Vestele and took up the torch offered to her from a guardsman to her left. She approached the pyre and paused to look out over her city. Utter darkness. Not a single light to be found.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She steeled herself and took a breath. The torch left her hand, and the oiled wood erupted in a sudden <i>fwoosh</i> of flame. Xayla stepped back from the wave of heat, shielding her face until she reached a comfortable distance. She looked out over the city once more. One by one, lights began to appear in the darkness as others followed her lead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Tonight, every soul in Avendal would be united in this ritual. Joined together, on this day of Remembrance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She returned to the High Priestess. The woman undid the ribbon of Xayla’s parcel and knelt, presenting the items inside to her queen.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Easy</i>, Xayla thought to herself as her eyes began to sting. She paused to control her breathing. <i>This is the easy part. You can do this.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She took the first item: a guardsman’s tunic. Her hands passed over its rough surface as she recalled the horrific events of that day. “Esosh,” she called out, projecting her voice over the crackling of the pyre. She unsheathed a knife at her side and cut a long strip of fabric from the chest. Somewhere to her right, his widow cried out in mourning. Xayla blinked back tears and forced herself to continue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sheathed the knife and set the strip aside, taking the tunic in hand. Three steps backward, and she addressed the crowd; dozens of downcast faces, somber and mirthless. Shadows danced around them in the firelight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Esosh was a brave and loyal soldier of the Royal Guard,” she proclaimed. “He was a loving husband and father. And four days ago, he gave his life to protect mine. Our kingdom is worse for his passing, and we will never again know his like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned back to the pyre and its eager flames. She stepped forward and scrunched the tunic into a ball. With a kiss, she tossed it into the waiting inferno. Within moments, it was consumed.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “He is lost, but not forgotten,” she said. The crowd repeated her words in unison.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She returned to Vestele, trying not to let the widow’s sobbing affect her too deeply. Methodical. Rote. She took the strip of fabric she had cut away, along with a winged emblem made of pure silver—the symbol of the Crown, of her family. It was the highest honor she could bestow upon the fallen soldier and <i>his</i> family. She wound the fabric tightly around the emblem and made her way to the grieving widow, then fell to her knees in the dirt before the woman, holding the offering outstretched above her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am honored, Your Grace” the woman managed between sobs, taking the offering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine,” Xayla replied, completing the rite. She stood, feeling a measure of relief at being that much closer to the end. But as she turned to leave, her gaze fell upon a small child hiding behind her mother’s skirts, eyes red and swollen.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her breath caught. She glanced up at the moon overhead. <i>Mother’s mercy</i>, it was too much. What had this child done to deserve such loss? She dropped back to her knees and pulled the girl into her arms. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, voice breaking. “I am so, so sorry.” She held the child close. The mother joined them, and together they wept.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A hand settled on her shoulder. Ari. Xayla nodded, pressed kisses to the foreheads of mother and child, then rose and returned to Vestele.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another tunic. Another name.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mora,” Xayla called, repeating the ritual. Another strip of fabric cut away. Another family’s grief echoing into the night.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mora was a brave and loyal woman of the Royal Guard,” she proclaimed. “A consummate heroine who brought pride and honor to her family. Four days ago, she risked her life to protect mine, and was taken from us well before her time. Our kingdom is worse for her passing, and we will never again know her like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She tossed Mora’s tunic into the flames. “She is lost, but not forgotten.” The crowd echoed her words. Another emblem. Another offering. Xayla knelt in the dirt before the woman’s father.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We are honored, Your Grace,” the elderly man said, accepting the offering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine,” Xayla replied, rising.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Their eyes met. He smiled through his tears and clasped her shoulder. “It’s okay,” he said softly. “She’s with the Mother now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla could only nod, doing her best to return the smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All too soon, she found herself in front of Vestele again. The honors done, she now faced the hardest part of the ceremony: her father. It wasn’t as difficult as she’d imagined, though. Perhaps consoling others in their grief had brought some catharsis, or perhaps she’d already worked through the worst of it. It certainly ached as she pried the gemstone loose from her father’s signet ring, but it didn’t sting the way she’d expected.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“King Gaillard Stefanus Avendar, the Fourth!” she bellowed, her voice swelling with pride as it carried over the assembled crowd. Several stamped their feet in response. Xayla smiled to herself. It felt good to speak his name like that, to honor him before them all. “My father,” she continued. “A great man, and a great leader. All loved him. All respected him.” She hesitated. The words were wrong, but they had to be said. “I pray to the Mother that I might be fortunate enough to follow in his footsteps. Our kingdom is worse for his passing, and we will never again know his like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned to the pyre and held the gemstone up to its light. The whole world felt surreal. Unmoored. Like it would crumble at the slightest touch. How could any of this be real? How could <i>his</i> kingdom continue without <i>him</i>? How had anyone ever expected her to live up to his name? Weeks after his death, and she still couldn’t fathom taking his place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He is lost, but not forgotten,” Xayla said reverently, tossing the gemstone into the fire. “I will miss you, Father.” She slid the now-empty ring onto her left index finger. Her hand found its way to her mother’s locket.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stood before the flames for what felt like an eternity, unable to move. She couldn’t bring herself to go back for the final rite. Not yet. She couldn’t say goodbye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari was again at her side. Xayla shook her head. “Later,” she mouthed. He nodded, and she wandered away from the gathered masses, finding a quiet spot atop an outcropping of rock a few dozen feet away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She listened as names were called out by the others, one by one. Seth. Grace. Mama. Papi. Duvar. Enna. Esto. Gren. Raolin. Veldas. Rorrith. Isa. Nen. Sabor. Geoff. Gruss. Maple. Jeoff. Dacey. Raso. Edith. Berro. Alli. Nasso. Mela. Karra. Cavin. Koth. Each one was someone’s mother, father, sister, brother, cousin, uncle, aunt, friend, lover, partner. Lost, every one of them. They had disappeared into the endless night, but they would live on in the hearts and minds of all they left behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much death. So much loss. She looked out over the city at the dozens of fires burning. Tens of thousands of names, it had to be. The sheer scale was staggering. Sobering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari joined her after a time. Together they sat in silence, well into the night. A tacit understanding passed between them, unspoken but absolute. <i>Never again</i>. There could never be another night like this.</span>>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Hours passed, and the moon shone brightly overhead. The crowd had thinned considerably. Only a few remained. Vestele. Ari. Several Xayla couldn’t name. Taetus, of all people. She tried not to pay them any mind as she returned for the last item in her parcel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She knelt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A black shawl trimmed in gold, bearing the silver eye of the Veilwyrd. Xayla took it and held it close to her chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Nira</i>,” she whispered. “I loved you. You were the family I never had. You were perfect—my light, my shining star. The one who always stood by me, no matter what. I always trusted you to have my back, always looked to you for guidance. I always knew you would be there for me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The pain and grief welled up again, and she couldn’t hold it back any longer. She sobbed, tears streaming freely down her face and over her lips. She could hardly breathe, but held nothing back. She buried her face in the shawl and wept, letting her pain bleed out into the world.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And now you’re not,” she said through broken gasps. “Now you are gone.” She clutched the shawl tightly, not wanting it to be final, not wanting to let go—but knowing she had to. “I miss you, Nira. I miss you so much. Why did you have to leave me? Why did you have to go?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t right.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>It wasn’t right.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span> 
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stood, unsheathing her knife and cutting out the segment of cloth around the silver eye. She turned to the pyre. It was still burning, though its intensity had waned considerably. She approached and threw the rest of the shawl onto the embers while she still had the strength to do so.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You are lost,” she whispered. “But you are not forgotten. I will never forget you.”</span>
<br><br>
