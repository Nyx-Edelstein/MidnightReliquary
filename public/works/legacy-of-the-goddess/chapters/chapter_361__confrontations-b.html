<span>Ari stumbled as his consciousness floated back into his body after experiencing a particularly gruesome death.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mother Above! Why had he thought that was the end of it? No, of course the rest of the pack still wanted to fight. They had him outnumbered seven-to-one after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Scanning around, he found where they were thinnest. A single Wulfkin stood by itself near the shore as the others grouped up and closed. Ari wasted no time going after it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t sure what he was expecting. Where the alpha put up a real fight, this one just stood there as Ari burned the rest of his reserves to cave its skull in before it could react.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With that one taken care of, Ari whirled about. He was surrounded now with precious little room to maneuver, and he was completely out of magic. He’d need a miracle to survive this, and he had just used one up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He feinted, baiting an attack, and only narrowly missed having his arm chomped off by one of the cubs as he yanked it back. He sensed movement in his periphery and ducked just in time to avoid a grapple, then pivoted into an axe kick that snapped the neck of a fourth Wulfkin that left itself open.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>VORP!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The sweet, sweet sound of salvation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Too late, Ari covered his face as he was splattered with a spray of blood, fur, and guts. Shards of razor ice and a blazing ball of fire rained down from above, followed by a rampaging Gazra leaping from the rock pile to land between him and what remained of the pack.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two Wulfkin that survived the initial volley—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>VORP!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The singular Wulfkin that survived the encounter scampered, whining, back into the forest.</span>
