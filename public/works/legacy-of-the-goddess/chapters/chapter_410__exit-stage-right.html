<span>The fledgling god-queen held Seff’s gaze for a long moment, her expression downright testy—before whatever vestiges of sanity still tethering her frayed mind caught her attention roughly nine hundred meters behind him, visible to her alone through the thick stone wall at his back. As would be expected, he supposed, of anyone violently expelled from the raw currents of unfettered possibility-space and onto the apron of the metaphysical stage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who or what was that speaking just now?” came a drawn-out question in Xayla’s voice, emanating from what most observers would reckon a soulless, lifeless shell. She startled as a thin stream of translucent Voidshimmer snaked through one ear and out the other, followed by a transverse current that drew her attention to a sharp point. “<i>What?</i>” she asked of an unknown interlocutor, a measure of color returning to her face. “No, I’m pretty sure—” She shook her head furiously, hands pressed to her temples. “No, it’s just me and Seff here. …Yes, Seff.” She caught his gaze again, narrowed her eyes, then not-so-furtively glanced away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Curious. Who could that be? Seff flicked a tendril of his own toward the coil of Voidshimmer, merged the streams, then waited.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, it <i>is</i> you,” he sent and received simultaneously. “Wait, what are <i>you</i> doing here?” he sent alone in follow-up. He grimaced, mildly perturbed he had not caught the intruding party out a second time and predictably catching a look from Xayla.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff quickly flicked through his mental index, attempting to register the voice. Female. Leyfaelian accent. Likely refugee turned Shadow Dancer apparat. Mm, this could get messy. He immediately conjured an appropriate crimson-edged teal countercipher—and just in time, as his oscillation met with a pulse of crystalline cyan that severed his stream. He flicked another coil out just in time to catch:</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla, you’re hallucinating,” the praesidial agent said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh heh,” Seff said. “Nice try.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The incoming Voidshimmer stream immediately rotated through a tri-harmonic resonance cascade and bifurcated gently like the splitting of a soap bubble. Seff counter-rotated his Voidshimmer coil to match. “Xayla, it’s okay, you’re safe for now,” the voice said. “Just… get back. Get back <i>here</i>,” the agent said with a thick conceptual emphasis that obviously anchored back to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff started, cocking his head with a frown. Anchored back to… <i>no.</i> Did she just—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Xayla, get back <i>there</i>,” the same voice said through the duplicate stream. No, not duplicate—it was a harmonic phantom! Except the second anchor masked the signature of the first, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ooh, clever!” he said, a wry grin playing across his lips. “Color me impressed! But was that really necessary? We both know I can just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Both streams abruptly severed, cutting Seff off mid-thought. He slumped, then glanced at Xayla, who predictably stared at him with a look of utter confusion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do you know Shesan?” she asked, a mite stupefied. “And which of those were…” she paused for a long moment. “Were either of those real?” she said in a very small voice. A third, similar yet broader question was written on every facet of her being, but she did not voice it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Seff said simply. She had been through enough already, and he couldn’t bring himself to respond with anything less than complete sincerity. It would be most unsporting to jest with her now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The shrine flooded with the presence of an angry demigod. “Do not play coy with me,” Xayla said coldly. “I know who you are.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff met her eyes and presence with his own. “And I, you.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A flash of lightning and a crack of thunder. The wind howled in my ears and buffeted my robes as a curtain of rain swept across the field. Horns and war drums accompanied the charge as a mass of shadow rose above the hills in the distance. A horde of the wretched cretins descended on our position just outside the castle gate, many of their eyes aflame with unholy light, their twisted, shriveled hearts beating with lust for my children’s blood.</span>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lord General and two of his men rode up beside me, their faces grim. I held up a hand. “Hold until they rout,” I said with conviction. “None more need die this day.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you will, Your Grace!” the Lord General replied. The trio turned and rode back to the line of soldiers at my back to relay the command.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ground beneath me buckled with the force of raw magic as I launched myself into the air to meet the oncoming horde. A torrent of wind and rain swirled around me as I soared high above the battlefield, calling down bolts of lightning and shards of razor ice upon the enemy ranks. I slammed into the ground deep in the enemy position, sending rocks, dirt, debris, and shattered bodies flying in all directions. Rising from the crater and wreathed in divine light, I raised an arm and pointed toward the Warlord.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The creature hefted a massive battleaxe high above his head and let out a bellowing roar—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—And a bolt of searing light obliterated his form, reducing him to smoldering ash and bone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The enemy broke and scattered around me, falling over themselves in terror. I took to the sky once more, arcing high over the fleeing hordes and devastating their ranks with divine wrath. Trumpets blared, heralding the charge of cavalry as they swept in to finish off the fleeing remnants. I turned my eyes to the sky, and… and…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A shimmering, chromatic tendril snaked across Xayla’s vision.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>And I, you.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla blinked as she came back to herself. She was still in the Repository with Seff. Feeling faint, she backed up against the wall and slid down to sit on the floor. Her hands trembled as she clasped them together in her lap, trying to steady her breathing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you not understand the <i>Xayla cipher</i>?” he asked inquisitively.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s mind refused to process the implications of his words.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Above her, the ceiling glowed with a faint blue light, reminiscent of the midday sky. Just as Ari and his team had reported of the other Lightsworn facility.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The… what?” she asked, remembering it was rude not to answer a question, while also unsure she wanted to know what Seff meant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My apologies,” Seff said softly. “I mistook you for somewhen else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla gaped over at him, her mind struggling to process anything, let alone his cryptic words. His expression softened as he sauntered over to sit beside her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was Null just here?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He made a gesture of clearing out his ear with a finger. “Was that a pun?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla closed her eyes, biting back tears of anger, frustration, and grief. Seff awkwardly patted her on the shoulder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do you know Shesan?” she repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is more correct to say that I do not,” Seff confessed. “But I know enough to understand people like her. And enough to piece together her story and accurately gauge her motivations. Suffice it to say that we have ideological differences.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Finally, some common ground,” she found herself muttering. She shook her head with a half-frown, half-smile. “She’s not that bad, though, once you get to know her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Rarely are. It’s the <i>others</i> you have to concern yourself with, and the lot she consorts with tend to muddy the distinction.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla pondered that as she looked him over. He was still very much the Seff she knew, despite more recent revelations. She knew better than to expect anything approaching a normal conversation with the man.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She slid down and eased onto her back, staring up at the not-sky. “I used to lie out in the green fields near the castle,” she began. “In my youth. And I would stare up at the great blue sky, and ponder the depths of Caelon’s mind. And I would fear, sometimes in my youthful folly, that her wisdom governing celestial bodies might fail suddenly, and I would grasp the earth beneath me as I imagined falling into the sky. After some time, I would realize how foolish I was, but the fear always stuck with me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Go on,” Seff encouraged her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A deep breath. “Zephyros <i>explicitly</i> told me that anything I wished to read, I would find there in that Library. That which I read, I experienced and felt, as real as anything I had ever felt. He told me I would have to fight to escape. If I wished to be neither the author nor the words on the page, but myself. And following that absolute trip of an experience, I now find myself lying on the floor of an overlook facility, with <i>you</i> in my company.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not who you were expecting?” Seff asked, cocking his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A sigh. “No, somehow that part makes sense,” Xayla said. “I believed every word Ari told me of his encounter with you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla gauged his reaction. Was he following her line of reasoning, or merely improvising and saying whatever came to mind? She wouldn’t put it past the man.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For what it’s worth, you needn’t be paranoid,” Seff answered as if in response to her thoughts. “I may be many things, but I am not your enemy. —Please be sure to tell your friend that. When next you meet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla swallowed hard. Did he mean Shesan, or Avalia herself?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My heart longs for home,” she confessed. “Though I fear I have nothing to go back to.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And why is that?” Seff asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Which one?” she asked with a weak laugh. “I could have sworn that library was my study when I first arrived. And I’m still not sure I’ve left.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, and?” Seff prompted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shook her head with a weak laugh. “I got to a point and started reading about my future encounters with entities I did not even know existed. And I was informed that I would experience something in the future. By reading about it in a book, not substantially different from the many others surrounding it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff pursed his lips. “Hmm, that doesn’t sound right. How many colors did it have? The book. And are you so sure you were reading it? Perhaps it was reading you?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>She thought to object at first, but chose instead to take him at face value. “On its cover was a majestic winged fish that shimmered with all the colors of the Void,” she said, pausing for a moment to recollect. “I suppose Lucia did try to warn me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff took in a long breath and sighed. He rose to his feet and paced to the other side of the shrine. “It’s quite common,” he said, striding over to fiddle with some mechanism, “to incorrectly specify one’s destination when attempting realmatic teleportation.” A click as he flicked a lever and a soft whirr as he fiddled with the controls. “And I will be honest with you: I’m still trying to find my own way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sat up and rose to her feet, listening intently. Something told her it would be best not to interrupt him, once he got going.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hrm…” he said, studying something Xayla could not see. “Aha!” He tapped a couple times and flicked a switch. Around them, the room began to dim. The walls were still there, but their surfaces showed ripple patterns that seemed to pulse rhythmically and slowly rotate around them. A shifting sea of blue flowed across the floor and cascaded over edges into the abyss.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Realm has some safeguards,” he said. “When you attempt to specify a region <i>outside</i>, something familiar will be there to catch you. To break your fall, if you will. And then, if and when you find your way out of the interdimensional maze back to something <i>real</i>, you inexorably find yourself here!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla frowned. “So this is some sort of… waystation?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In a manner of speaking,” Seff replied. “A nexus point between realms. Or a terminus if you will. A Repository for those who find themselves lost in the Void Between Worlds. One moment.” He held up a finger, then strode over to ruffle through his knapsack. With a word and a breath of chromatic mist, a cello, a harp, a horn, a bell, some drums, and a few other instruments began floating about the hall and playing in concert. Xayla watched, rapt with attention.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He made his way back to the control station. A few more taps and clicks and the scenery changed. They were now standing on the streets of Castletown as masons and craftsmen moved about, paving roads and erecting buildings. The castle loomed in the background, its towers unfinished with scaffolding still in place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“See this brick?” he asked, holding it up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tossed it her way, and she caught it. “Do you?” he asked. “Do you truly see it? Are you holding it in your hands? Where is your attention right now? Are you imagining a brick in your mind as I describe it to you, or are you seeing and feeling the brick in front of your face?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… can’t be sure,” she confessed, turning it over and examining it. A simple brick. No distinctive markings or etchings. “I am definitely seeing and feeling a brick in my hands.” She paused to consider. If it was an illusion, it was the best she had ever seen. “But going along with your line of reasoning, I can certainly imagine what it would be like to, for instance, be a person who was merely an audience member of one of your exquisite plays, rather than…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She trailed off, glancing about. She stepped aside as the image of a master craftsman and his apprentice made their way through the space, carrying a bundle of wooden poles.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She caught Seff’s eye, and he grinned. “Have I ever remarked on your cleverness?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A time or two,” Xayla said. “<i>Wisest Caelon speaks most oft to those who listen.</i>”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked down at the brick. Somehow it seemed far more real, as if it had a weight to it that it previously did not have.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And who, pray tell, was responsible for placing that brick?” Seff asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla considered for a long moment, turning it over in her hands and examining the scene. “Ultimately, one of the founders of Avendal, I suppose? I couldn’t tell you the name of the specific craftsman, but the job would have been contracted to either the Fraternity of Masons or the Freebuilders, during the reign of King Domhall Gavrillius I, circa year 362 of the Forsaken Era. Meaning Duke Ahnfred Lotan likely signed the order and oversaw the project at the behest of the King, as our people prepared to evacuate the Plains of Ruin and settle permanently west of Talus.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stupendous!” Seff remarked. “And how is it you know that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve studied many books on Avalian history,” she replied matter-of-factly. “It was expected of me, being of royal lineage, to be knowledgeable about our kingdom’s past.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She glanced to Seff, who was now beaming ear to ear. He took a seat, motioning for her to continue. “Well?” he prompted. “Go on. You were on the verge of an epiphany.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla wasn’t so sure about that. What was he getting at? She looked between him and the brick, holding far too much in mind at the same time as she attempted to follow his chain of reasoning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I guess the next natural question would be, why stop there, with the King? Why not Avalia, or the Celestial Triad?” She scoffed. “But that’s absurd. One cannot ascribe to the Goddesses responsibility for placing a single, unimportant brick. You could have just as easily picked any other…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>As the words left her mouth, she felt strong emotions pulling at the edges of her attention. Here she was, holding just-some-random-brick as she pondered the nature of meaning itself and her place in the Realm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Precisely,” Seff said. “And yet one day, for one moment in time, it was someone’s job to lay that brick. That specific brick, the very real brick you hold in your hand. Not the idea of a brick. Not abstractly ‘so-and-so placed this brick here on such and such day for some ultimately cosmic reason.’ Someone laid <i>that</i> brick <i>there</i>, as a foundational and necessary step in building Castletown. And even the person whose life passed through that brick as it left their hands did not know its ultimate importance.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nearly dropped the brick as she fell to her knees, covering her mouth as the world spun in her mind. She…</span>
<br><br>
<span>No, the world wasn’t actually spinning. That was just Seff fiddling with the controls again. The scene faded away and they were back in the shrine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She still held the brick in her hand, though the instruments had vanished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sighed. “This wasn’t taken from the foundations of Avendal, was it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff chuckled. “No, Xayla. I confess, it is not some random yet highly symbolic brick. It is however <i>the</i> Symbolic Brick, which just so happens to correspond exactly to some random yet highly symbolic brick, as I just described by way of admittedly amateur operation of this facility, together with expert showmanship and judicious use of Lightweaving. A very important distinction, mind you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She opened her mouth to speak and then closed it again. A flat “what?” was all she could manage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His expression soured slightly. “You are currently holding the Symbolic Brick,” he said matter-of-factly. “Which means, inexorably, that as a result of this conversation, you will confer to me something I highly covet and value. I have come to understand that this is a basic and foundational law of your realm, and one that not even Avalia could contravene. So <i>if you please…</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is that a threat?” Xayla asked warily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff gawked at her. “Which do you mean?” He held up a hand and ticked off fingers. “The brick, myself, or let’s see… the metaphor, the symbolic act, or merely the rigid fixedness of it?” He held up a single finger, having skipped ticking the middle one to count on the other side. “Yes, <i>that one</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla narrowed her eyes. “Presuming I can help you to leave, how am I supposed to get back?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Back where?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Home. To Avendal. My Avendal. The one I left.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff scratched his chin. “Honestly? I thought <i>I</i> came the long way ’round. I’m not sure I can help you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s shoulders slumped at first, but something within her stirred. She stood up straight and met his eyes. “At least tell me what you can of the Wandering Weald. You mentioned going there once. I know from my visions that one of the fragments of the Sanctern reside there, and no one knows anything about the place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff placed a finger upon his brow and crossed his arms. Xayla waited patiently.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I will tell you what I can, and in return you must promise to open the Gate for me,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla considered for a long moment, then nodded. “Agreed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff strode back to the control station and began tapping at various mechanisms. The shrine flickered—once showing a dense forest canopy, then a vast desert under twin suns, then what appeared to be the interior of a massive clockwork mechanism. He frowned, tapped again, and the scene shifted to an upside-down ocean with fish swimming through the air above their heads. “Blast it,” he muttered. “Hang with me, this thing is more temperamental than I remember.” Another few adjustments produced only crystalline fractals that buzzed and hummed discordantly. He threw up his hands in defeat and went through a final series of motions that returned the room to normal, then dimmed the lights. “Right, then. The old-fashioned way it is.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a flourish of his hand, chromatic mist began to pool at their feet. Seff reached into the gathering fog and withdrew—impossibly—a single geometric form: a perfect sapphire dodecahedron that pulsed with internal light. He set it hovering in the air between them, then drew forth a second shape: an intricate lattice of silver threads that folded in on themselves in patterns that hurt to follow for too long. “Picture, if you will,” he began, his voice taking on the cadence of a storyteller, “a world not so different from your own. A world where mortals looked upon the works of creation and saw not merely beauty, but <i>structure</i>. Pattern. Law.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dodecahedron began to rotate slowly as he spoke, each facet reflecting scenes that seemed to exist within its depths—scholars poring over ancient texts, philosophers debating under starlit skies, mathematicians tracing formulae in sand. “They studied the movements of celestial bodies,” Seff continued, weaving the silver lattice around the dodecahedron like a cage. “And in doing so, discovered that the heavens themselves were governed by principles that could be <i>understood</i>. Predicted. Replicated.” The lattice contracted, and the scenes within the dodecahedron grew sharper, more defined. “They called this discovery Caelonics—named for Caelon—not as worship, but as <i>recognition</i>. An acknowledgment that the order they perceived was woven into the very fabric of reality itself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He produced a third object: a quill that wrote in light, tracing equations and diagrams in the air that assembled themselves into a slowly spinning sphere around the other two objects. “And so they learned to measure time, to chart the stars, to build great edifices that would stand for millennia—all by observing, understanding, and applying the fundamental laws that governed their world.” The sphere pulsed once, and all three objects suddenly collapsed into a single point of brilliant blue light that hung suspended between Seff’s outstretched hands. “They had discovered that godhood was not some distant, unreachable state—but rather a <i>perspective</i>. A way of seeing. Of knowing. Of doing. Of becoming.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The light faded, and the objects vanished back into chromatic mist. Seff lowered his hands and met Xayla’s eyes. “But that, of course, was before they learned what happens when mortals reach too far into the realm of the divine. Before they discovered that some knowledge carries a price that cannot be unpaid.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gestured, and the chromatic mist swirled once more, coalescing into a shimmering cityscape—towers of crystalline spires reaching toward impossible heights, their surfaces etched with flowing script that pulsed with gentle luminescence. Streets laid out in perfect geometric patterns, gardens arranged according to mathematical harmonies that pleased both eye and mind. “Leyfaelia, this place was called,” Seff intoned, his voice taking on a reverent quality. “A vibrant and prosperous civilization built upon knowledge and the systematic inquiry of natural law. They were masters of observation, of experimentation, of learning through repeated trial and careful measurement.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The scene shifted, showing scholars in flowing robes gathered around intricate mechanisms, recording observations, debating theories. Xayla watched, transfixed, as the vision showed a people not unlike her own—curious, ambitious, driven to understand the world around them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But these people,” Seff continued, his tone darkening, “tampered with forces beyond their imagining or control. They sought to bind the very essence of creation itself into vessels of their own making. And one day—” he snapped his fingers, and the scene shattered like glass, “—they unleashed terrors.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>From the fragments of the shattered vision emerged shapes that made Xayla’s blood run cold. Mechanical constructs of impossible complexity—bodies wrought from materials that seemed to drink in light, limbs that moved with horrifying precision, single eyes that burned with an eerie, emotionless glow. They walked on multiple legs like great spiders, or hovered on pillars of concentrated force, their forms bristling with appendages whose purpose she could only guess at—and feared to imagine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The constructs moved through the city with methodical efficiency, dismantling everything in their path. Not destroying—but <i>processing</i>. Converting. Reorganizing matter according to some incomprehensible design. Buildings were systematically deconstructed into their constituent elements, living beings were analyzed and categorized and sorted, the very earth itself was reshaped according to parameters no mortal mind could fathom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Magical automatons,” Seff said quietly, “that sought to usurp the Realm for their own. Not out of spite, or malice, nor out of a sense of pride or ultimate purpose. Not for the sake of some ideology, nor for any reason anyone could possibly name.” He paused, letting the horror of the scene sink in. “But simply, because no one understood how to tell them not to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The vision showed desperate scholars attempting to halt the constructs—chanting words of power, inscribing counter-sigils, even physically attacking them with enchanted weapons that expelled bursts of raw magic. Nothing worked. The automatons continued their inexorable work, treating resistance as simply another variable to be processed and optimized around. Xayla watched as one construct calmly vaporized a group of defenders, then immediately returned to its task of cataloguing and reorganizing the rubble at its feet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They had created something that could not be reasoned with,” Seff continued, “because they had never taught it how to stop and ask questions, to argue and debate, to be proven wrong. Only how to execute instructions. To <i>complete the function for which it was designed</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The scene accelerated, showing years of devastation compressed into moments. The beautiful city was reduced to geometric arrangements of sorted materials. The population scattered, decimated, transformed. The mist began to darken to deep purple and grey.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And in the wake of the destruction that followed,” he said softly, almost reverently, “was born the Fading.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The chromatic mist shifted to deep indigo and shadow. From the darkness emerged figures—humanoid, but wrong in subtle ways that set Xayla on edge. Their skin bore intricate patterns that seemed to shift and flow like living tattoos, geometric designs interweaving with organic curves in ways that suggested both art and equation. Their eyes glowed with an inner light—not the cold, dead light of the automatons, but something warmer, sadder, and infinitely more <i>aware</i>. They wore flowing garments that seemed woven from the Void itself, adorned with jewelry that phased in and out of material existence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“These beings moved through a realm that existed <i>adjacent</i> to the physical world—a space of pure concept and abstraction made tangible. Around them, the ruins of Leyfaelia had been transformed into something new: structures that existed in multiple states simultaneously, architecture that served purposes beyond mere habitation. They had not simply survived the catastrophe—they had <i>transcended</i> it, evolving into something that could exist in the spaces between the light and the darkness, between matter and energy, between thought and reality.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The vision pulled back, showing the liminal realm in its entirety—a mirror of creation itself, but viewed from an angle mortals were never meant to perceive. These post-Leyfaelian beings looked down upon the material world not with contempt, but with a mixture of longing and detachment, like scholars studying a beloved text from which they had been forever separated. They had become creatures of pure understanding, dwelling in the realm of abstract principle and mathematical truth, forever removed from the physical world their ancestors had tried so desperately to comprehend and control.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff allowed the vision to dissipate slowly, the twilit figures fading back into mist. “Your…<i>friend</i>,” he said, the word carrying layers of meaning she couldn’t quite parse, “comes from this world. It is her past, but for you—providence willing—a never-written future.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The implications cascaded through her mind like a toppling house of cards. Shesan had shown her fragments of this in a vision—the collapse of her civilization, the technomagical terrors, and her desperate flight through a portal of shadows—but Xayla had thought it merely an unfortunate end to her world at the hands of the Enemy. A cautionary tale to motivate her in her quest. Now she understood: this was not <i>a</i> future, but <i>the</i> future that awaited any world where Mind grew unchecked, untempered by Will’s restraint or Spirit’s heart. The Sanctern fragments she sought—if she succeeded in gathering them all, if she unified Caelon’s acumen without Vaka’s passion or Nenore’s valor—would not find her kingdom’s enlightenment, but something else. Her people would become <i>efficient</i>. And in the cold mathematics of pure Mind divorced from compassion or purpose, efficiency meant only one thing: the systematic conversion of all reality into ordered, meaningless perfection. The quest she had undertaken to save her people would doom them all to the same fate that had birthed the Fading, and she would be the architect of her world’s transformation into a geometric nightmare of prismatic perfection, not unlike the present un-reality she hoped so desperately to escape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do you know all this?” she asked, voice trembling as she processed the revelation. “Were you there? Did you witness Leyfaelia’s fall?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff’s expression flickered with something between amusement and melancholy. “Would it surprise you to learn,” he said with deliberate casualness, “that these hands once cupped Caelon’s tits?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla did not want to contemplate that hypothetical, but merely imagining him with the Celestial Sovereigns—any of them, all of them, let alone Caelon—revealed in her mind the answer. “You are saying that you refuse to tell me how to find the Sanctern fragment within the Wandering Weald?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who do you think put it there?” Seff asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla considered that for a moment, then responded simply, “Fair enough.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff returned to the control station and began adjusting the mechanisms once more. The shrine flickered, cycled through several rapid scenes—a starfield, an underground cavern dripping with luminescent moss, a massive whirlpool far at sea—before finally settling on a new vista.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They now stood in a natural grotto, its walls rough-hewn stone glistening with moisture. Shafts of pale light filtered down from above, illuminating a stone archway. And before that archway stood two figures.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The guardians were massive—easily twice her height—and appeared to be carved from living stone. The one on the left gripped a sword in both hands held high above its head, its blade straight and simple yet radiating an aura of absolute finality. The other held a tall, twisted, gnarled staff outstretched in its hands, its head an absent socket.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are those—” Xayla began, taking an involuntary step back. “Are those the same kind of automatons you just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Seff said quickly, waving a hand dismissively. “Not quite. These are guardians. Sentinels. Far simpler in function, and bound by very specific parameters.” He gestured toward the archway between them at the far end, where a shimmering barrier of light rippled like the surface of disturbed water. “They protect the Gate. And I need your help to open it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla studied the stone figures warily, then looked to the archway, stepping forward to examine its reflective surface. “The Gatesong?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you please,” Seff said. “Though it is currently locked, and I believe you possess the key.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla pondered this, her gaze shifting between the two stone guardians. She approached cautiously, studying the staff-bearer more closely. The socket at the head of the twisted wood was perfectly circular, with intricate grooves along its interior rim.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A faint recognition stirred in her memory. No, it couldn’t be…? The crystal she had taken from the dazeworm cave! She didn’t have it with her. But…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked down at the brick still clutched in her hand. The Symbolic Brick. A foundational object that somehow corresponded to meaning itself, as Seff had so eloquently demonstrated. If it could represent any brick in the foundations of Avendal, could it not represent something else entirely?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She closed her eyes and reached inward, feeling for that familiar wellspring of divine radiance—Caelon’s Gift, the Celestial Light of Mind, that which allowed her to navigate the strange recesses of infinity to find her way here. The energy responded immediately, flooding through her mind. She focused her intent on the brick, visualizing its structure breaking down into constituent elements, then reforming: the precise dimensions of the dazeworm crystal, its faceted surface, the way it had gleamed and scattered the light…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The brick grew warm in her hands. She opened her eyes to see it shifting, its rough surface smoothing into polished clarity, its rectangular form contracting into an irregularly shaped, though perfect geometric crystal. Within moments, she held an exact replica of the key she had left behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Instinctively, she stepped forward and placed the crystal into the socket at the head of the staff.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It fit perfectly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A resonant <i>click</i> echoed through the grotto as the crystal locked into place. The staff-bearing guardian immediately raised its weapon high above its head. Light from the ceiling shafts struck the crystal, which refracted the beam at a precise angle—directly onto the blade of its companion’s sword.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sword-bearer moved with surprising grace for something carved from stone. It lowered itself to one knee and angled the blade forward, offering the weapon up toward the archway as the refracted light played across its surface, splitting into a spectrum of colors that washed over the shimmering barrier.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stepped forward, steadying her hand as she reached out. The moment her fingers closed around the hilt, the world seemed to crystallize around her—every detail sharp and vivid, more real than anything she had experienced since entering this strange place. The weight of it was perfect in her grip, and its blade sang with a divine yearning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How can this be real?” she breathed, holding the sword in her outstretched hand and turning the blade to examine it more closely. Light danced along its edge, and in the polished surface she caught a glimpse of something—a figure, ethereal and luminous, hovering just at the periphery of the reflection. The shape was distinctly feminine, geometric yet graceful, formed of intersecting planes of Void-tinged light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null?” Xayla spun around to search the grotto. But she was nowhere to be found—only stone walls, the two guardian statues, and Seff watching her with calm interest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then the Songfish bellowed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sound was unlike anything Xayla had ever heard—not merely auditory, but felt in her bones, in her soul. It reverberated through multiple dimensions at once: <b>⟨◈≈⊙◈≈⊙◈⩘◈∿⊗≋≋∿≋◈≈⟩</b>, a cry that was simultaneously a whisper and a roar, a lullaby and a dirge, expressing concepts that she conceptually understood had no words in any mortal tongue. The glyphs seemed to hang in the air around her, visible for a heartbeat before dissolving into chromatic mist.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sword in her hands shuddered. Xayla watched in awe as the blade began to fragment—not breaking, but <i>deconstructing</i> itself into its fundamental components. The metal separated into flowing curves and sharp angles, geometric solids that rotated through impossible axes. Mathematical expressions materialized in glowing script: <i>∫∇²φ·dV</i>, <i>ℏω=E</i>, <i>∇×B</i>, <i>∮E·dl</i>, <i>⟨ψ|H|ψ⟩</i>, <i>⟨0|Φ|0⟩≠0 | [Φᵢ,Φⱼ]=iΦₖ | □Φ=-Φ⁻¹𝝥(Φ)·ε-𝝨[Φ]×Ṡ+∇×𝝠(Φ)·δ³(Ⱑ)</i>. Abstract symbols—some of which she partway recognized from ancient texts—intermingled with shapes that defied all logic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Each piece grew smaller, contracting into points of brilliant light that began to orbit around each other. The fragments aligned themselves into a helix of pure concept and form, spiraling upward with increasing velocity. With a sound like wind chimes played in reverse, the stream of light and meaning shot upward through the ceiling of the Repository, disappearing into the heavens above.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’d be careful with that, if I were you,” Seff remarked casually.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stared at her empty hands, then up at where the sword had vanished. “Was I just holding the Sword of the Sovereigns?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff tilted his head thoughtfully. “The Godcleaver, some call it. Hardly unique. There are other blades that drink deep of wickedness, consuming malevolence itself and growing sharper with each feeding. Some whisper to their wielders, offering power in exchange for… well.” He twirled his fingers through the air. “Any weapon capable of destroying evil must understand evil intimately. And such understanding can be dangerous when the blade cannot distinguish between the evil it was forged to fight and the darkness dwelling within its wielder.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shuddered. “It sounds as if you’re speaking from experience.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Quite.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned back to the Gate. The featureless white reflective surface had transformed, now showing depths that mirrored the Void—an infinite expanse of swirling darkness punctuated by distant points of chromatic light. Along the archway’s perimeter, runes pulsed with a steady red light, their ancient script at once both familiar and foreign.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A deal was a deal. She looked to Seff, then back to the Gate, and began to sing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Gatesong rose from somewhere deep within her, notes she had never learned yet somehow knew. The melody wove through harmonies that should have been impossible for a single voice, each phrase carrying weight that resonated with the fundamental structure of reality itself. As she sang, the runes along the archway pulsed in response—red fading to brilliant blue, then shifting to radiant gold. The surface of the Gate rippled and transformed, its depths becoming something more defined, more <i>real</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff collected his knapsack and slung it over his shoulder, making his way toward the now-open portal. At the threshold, he paused and turned to shake her hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Make your story a good one, Xayla,” he said, his expression serious for perhaps the first time since she’d met him. “But most importantly, make sure you write it. I would very much like to read it someday.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She couldn’t help but smile. The audacity of the man—as if her life were some grand tale meant for his amusement! And yet… something in his words struck her as strangely reassuring. A reminder that her choices still held weight. That whatever came next would be <i>hers</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodbye, Seff,” she said quietly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This isn’t goodbye, I’d wager,” he said, stepping toward the shimmering portal. “Until next time, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And with that, he stepped through the Gate and vanished, leaving Xayla alone in the Repository.</span>
