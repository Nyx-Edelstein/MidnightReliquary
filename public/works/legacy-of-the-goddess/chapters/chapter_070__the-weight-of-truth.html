<span>“Are you a traitor?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. Never,” the young man said curtly. He looked nervous. Jittery.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla recorded his response, as well as other details of his disposition. She couldn’t be sure of his age, but his boyish features suggested he might be the youngest Veilwyrd she’d met thus far.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you working with Vesyrn?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla did a double take.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh. Not to traitorous ends,” he added swiftly. “He was my handler. My mentor. That’s all—I swear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>His response is sincere,</i> Null’s voice echoed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla finished her notes. Why couldn’t they all be this straightforward?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That will be all for now,” she said, nodding to the guards.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really?” he asked, seeming surprised. “That’s it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla refrained from comment, watching in silence as he was led away. This was taking much longer than she’d anticipated; no point in dragging it out further.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Are you a traitor?” Xayla asked. <i>Traitor</i>, she thought to herself. At some point, the word had stopped sounding real.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am not, Your Grace,” the man said with a frown. He sat with one leg crossed over the other, hands resting on his knee. He seemed attentive and respectful, with an air of refined charm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She recorded his response and the other details. “Are you working with Vesyrn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Your Grace. It pains me to even be associated with that wretch of a man. His treachery is a stain upon us all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A little much, she thought, but at least he was forthcoming—unlike most of the others. Xayla jotted down her notes.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I cannot be certain of his response,</i> Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really?” Xayla blurted out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, nothing,” she said, nodding to the guards. “Thank you for your cooperation. That will be all for now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rose, bowed to her, then nodded to the guards and left the room without further delay.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Are you a traitor?” Xayla asked by rote. By now, she was just going through the motions.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The older Veilwyrd woman stared at her incredulously. “No, Your Grace. I am not,” she said, her voice carrying <i>precisely</i> enough mocking disdain to make her thoughts clear without quite crossing the line into outright disrespect. “Why do you ask?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rolled her eyes, though she had to admire the woman’s skill. A true Veilwyrd, testing boundaries without quite crossing them. Best to stick to the script. “Are you working with Vesyrn?” she asked, scribbling her notes mechanically. The hours had dragged on far too long, and her patience was thoroughly spent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman raised an eyebrow. “What’s your angle here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla set down her quill and folded her hands on the table. She took a slow, measured breath. <i>Patience,</i> she reminded herself. Meeting the woman’s eyes, she managed a strained smile. “If you would answer my questions truthfully and directly, we can both be done here much sooner.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This can’t be just routine bookkeeping,” the woman said, completely ignoring Xayla’s instruction. “Otherwise you wouldn’t be doing it yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla closed her eyes, resting her head on the table. How many more were left? Surely they were almost done by now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman continued, unfazed by Xayla’s exhaustion. “Besides, I wouldn’t expect you to think you’d come up with something novel here on your own. You clearly have something else in mind. So what is this really about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you working with Vesyrn?” Xayla repeated, not bothering to raise her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace,” the woman said with that distinct smarmy tone. The shuffle of the guardsmen shifting stance and raising their weapons told Xayla the woman had tried to stand. She was what, the sixth to try that now? Why did they all insist on these transparent attempts to ingratiate themselves?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She leaned back in her chair, rubbing her face. “Please,” she said. “Just answer the question.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Forgive me,” the woman said. “I just want to help. That’s all. There’s much to be done, and we’re less than useless like this. You have to see that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You can best help by answering my question,” Xayla said tersely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“With respect, Your Grace, what does that accomplish? You’re clearly asking these questions of all of us. Do you imagine any traitors would out themselves? You know what we are, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Caelon’s tits!” Xayla yelled, her frustration having reached its limits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman withdrew fractionally; even she was shocked at Xayla’s sudden outburst.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Listen</i>,” Xayla said irritably. “I don’t give a rockrat’s ass what you have to say right now. I’m probably the least competent interrogator you’ll ever have the good fortune to be questioned by, so it doesn’t even matter what I think of you. But I have magical powers granted to me by <i>Avalia herself</i> that let me tell when someone is being sincere—and they <i>don’t work</i> when you’re trying to be clever or smarmy. So just answer the <i>thrice-damned question</i>, and we can both be done here. Alright?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman hesitated, then let out a slow breath. “In that case: no, I am not working with Vesyrn,” she said, her tone stripped of its earlier sarcasm. “Had no knowledge of his plans, nor would I have supported them if I had.” She paused, meeting Xayla’s eyes directly. “I am loyal to the Crown, Your Grace. True to my oath, I will serve you faithfully until my last breath.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you!”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I judge her response to be sincere,</i> Null’s voice said. Xayla made the note, and circled this one as a potential addition to her personal guard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My pleasure, Your Grace. Is that all?” the woman asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For now,” she said, motioning to the guards.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Goddesses, have mercy.</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla handed her final report to Wymar. He studied the parchment intently, his eyes scanning over the three categories she’d compiled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Veilwyrd had been sorted based on three assessments: Null’s judgment of their sincerity during questioning, Xayla’s own impressions, and the evaluations from Wymar’s staff. She’d weighted them carefully—heavily favoring Null’s readings above all else. Her reasoning was simple: while Null might struggle with clever evasions or ambiguous responses, she was confident the entity wouldn’t mistake <i>insincerity</i> for sincerity. That margin of error seemed vanishingly small.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Anyone Null had judged as sincere went straight into the “Cleared” category, regardless of other opinions. Those Null had found inconclusive—but whom both Xayla and Wymar’s staff believed loyal—were marked as “Maybe Clear.” Everyone else fell into the final bucket: “Maybe Traitors.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla had deliberately discounted her own judgment in the process. She knew she was too inexperienced, too easily manipulated. Better to trust Null’s assessments and the collective wisdom of Wymar’s advisors than her own gut feelings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And you’re certain of this?” Wymar asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As certain as I can be,” Xayla said. “I’m confident in everyone I’ve marked as ‘cleared’—I’ll keep a couple of the most trusted ones here for my personal guard. The ‘maybe clear’ group should be safe enough working alongside the cleared Veilwyrd. We can send them on missions or have them deal with the roaming Blin. Arlinkar should be fit for duty by now; I trust him with the logistics.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar frowned. “There are two in the ‘clear’ category that we’ve all judged to be disloyal. Xayla, I can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” she said, cutting him off with a raised hand. “I know how it sounds. But you have to trust me on this. Everyone in the ‘cleared’ category is loyal. I’m certain of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He eyed her. She stood, resolute.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say,” he said with a sigh. “What are your plans for the others?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shifted uneasily. “I want to go in for at least one more round of questioning, using the cleared Veilwyrd for assistance. And while I work out how to best sort through them, maybe we can…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar stiffened, his gaze shifting away from hers. She fell silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I’m leaving for the front in the morning. We both know that I can’t spare the men necessary to guard them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s fine,” she said, placing a hand on his arm. “I understand. But they can’t all be traitors. If you don’t think it’s worth sorting through them further, we’ll go with your initial plan. If you believe you can keep them under control, I’ll defer to your judgment.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded, easing up. “Thank you. I’ll take the ‘maybe traitors’ with me, then. I’ll rest better anyway knowing that you’re not in danger.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You shouldn’t worry about me,” Xayla said, offering him a reassuring smile. “The Veilwyrd are back in service—well, some of them at least. I’m feeling safer already.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He returned the smile, though it seemed a bit forced.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ari undid the lace on his chest and placed his hand on the table, keeping his eyes fixed on Xayla the whole time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla wasn’t sure what approach he planned to take, but she kept her expression neutral. She was vulnerable right now—though he couldn’t possibly know that. One thing was certain: if he wanted to get what he was after, he’d have to work for it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unless I’m misinterpreting…” he said, pausing in thought. “As long as I stay clear of the gossips, I can move to your side of the castle?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She met his eyes, unflinching. “That might be a possibility. But you don’t know who all the gossips are.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gaped at her, screwing up his face. “I’m pretty sure I do know who they are. And I don’t understand why this has to be so complicated. You already know I intend to seduce you. Can you just give me a straight answer? Do you have any other lovers or not?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari!” Xayla said, taken aback. “You can’t ask questions like that outright! Besides, I won’t know if it’ll work until you actually try.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” he said, reaching for her chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey—hands off!” Xayla yelped, batting his hand away. “That’s not how this works!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari pulled back, crossing his arms in frustration. “Look. I’m trying my best here. It’s not my fault if I don’t know what I’m doing. It’s your job to explain the rules.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, fine,” she said with a sigh. He had a point—she was just used to more experienced partners. “I’ll coach you through it. But don’t get upset if things don’t go exactly the way you want. One step at a time, okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. Pick up your hand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did so.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now—without saying anything—place the three cards you intend to use face down on your side of the table.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded again, following along.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Declare your intent,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I intend to seduce you and steal your secrets so I can avoid your gossips—even though I already know which ones they are—and infiltrate further to your side of the castle. But you knew all that already.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla ignored him, placing four of her own cards face down—two green Veilwyrd, a blue lover, and a red mystic. “Now roll the dice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did so. A three. Xayla muttered a curse under her breath, picking up the lover card and returning it to her hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now flip them over,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched with increasing agitation as he flipped over a red lover, a green merchant, and a blue Veilwyrd. Ugh. She was expecting him to play the red general. She still had a chance to keep him from progressing, but first she’d have to make sure he didn’t—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari played a second blue Veilwyrd over his face-up one. “I can do that, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Another blue Veilwyrd?!</i> How… “—Yes. That is technically a legal move.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. Good. Then I use my blue Veilwyrd to distract your green ones.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari! Are you cheating? How do you know I have two green Veilwyrd?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Because you just told me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What—no, you can’t… that’s not…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla! Relax, I’m only joking,” he said with a laugh. “But really. What else would you play? You expected me to use the red general again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla scowled, removing her two Veilwyrd from play. Ari did the same. He pushed his merchant forward, and she was forced to show her mystic. She took his red cryst and both cards were returned to their hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Satisfied? I now send my red lover to seduce you and steal your—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yes, fine,” she said bitterly, unwinding the lace on her chest and flipping it open. “Go ahead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a smirk, Ari reached inside and took out the runed figurine that represented her secret documents, placing it in his own chest.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla peered out from her litter as she was carried toward the Temple of Avalia. It had been nearly two weeks since she’d last left the castle, and the state of Castletown was worse than she’d thought.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The stench was every bit as unbearable as before, though the grisly scenes of battle had long since been cleaned away and the bodies removed. Many houses stood boarded up, their shutters and doors sealed tight. The barricades from the siege had been dismantled, their timber repurposed into makeshift shelters and lean-tos. Still, <i>so many</i> people remained out on the streets. Piles of refuse littered the walkways and choked the alleys. Xayla pressed her lavender-scented silk closer to her face, a knot of anger and sorrow tightening in her chest. She had to do something about this. Seeing her people living in such squalor was unbearable.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her procession reached the temple, and she stepped down from the litter. The High Priestess waited at the stone steps—a middle-aged woman garbed in flowing white robes, her white-blonde hair pulled into a tight bun. Above them loomed the magnificent bell tower of the temple.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Our queen, the blessed champion of the Holy Mother, graces us with her presence,” Vestele intoned. A chorus of bells rang out from a dozen monks standing on either side of her, their incense lamps sending fragrant smoke curling through the air. Vestele descended the steps and offered her hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla took it and curtsied. “The pleasure is mine, Your Holiness. Thank you for receiving me. We have much to discuss.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But of course. Please—after you, Your Grace,” Vestele said, gesturing to the abbey.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded and took the lead, her guard fanning out to cover the steps. Ari and her two Veilwyrd bodyguards took up positions by the archway as she passed into the abbey. She would have preferred them at her side, but weapons weren’t permitted anywhere on temple grounds—and neither were soldiers of any kind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She and the priestess continued alone through a hanging garden lined with stone statues of previous monarchs. Xayla searched for Father’s likeness, but it was nowhere to be found.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It has been commissioned but is not yet complete,” Vestele said, following her gaze. “I’ll be sure to send for you once it arrives.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you. I look forward to seeing it,” Xayla lied with an amiable smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An abbot met them at the vestibule and led them deeper inside. With every step, Xayla’s heart fluttered harder in her chest. She rehearsed her words again, dreading the conversation that drew closer with each passing moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At last they reached a sitting room that had been prepared for the occasion. Xayla entered and took her seat, followed by Vestele. The abbot closed the door behind them, leaving the two of them alone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The priestess settled into her seat. “You seem rather nervous, dear,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” Xayla admitted. “Can you blame me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tea?” Vestele reached for the kettle on the table and poured two cups, offering Xayla one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla accepted the cup with a nod of thanks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid we’re fresh out of nightshade, or I’d offer some,” Vestele said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla choked on her tea, struggling not to spray hot liquid across the table. “Pardon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just a bit of humor to lighten the mood,” Vestele said with a slight smile. Xayla managed a nervous laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla set her cup aside, having momentarily lost her train of thought. She struggled to find the right words. “I’ve been meaning to speak with you for some time now,” she began. “I find myself in a rather precarious situation. The entire army witnessed me combating the hordes with Avalia’s divine power. And yet…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shifted in her seat, leaning forward. “What name is she using?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla cocked her head quizzically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know it wasn’t Avalia who granted you that boon, dear,” Vestele said. “So what is she calling herself?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid you’re mistaken,” Xayla replied, feeling genuinely confused. “The Holy Mother spoke to me—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nonsense,” Vestele said, waving a hand dismissively. “Avalia’s been dead for ages.” Xayla sputtered—how did she even know that? <i>Ages?</i>—but Vestele continued on casually, paying her no mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “I can’t tell you how much I’ve been dreading this conversation,” Vestele said. “I’ve been fretting over how best to get in touch with you—and whether any of our efforts would be for naught. I’m glad you’ve come to me, though. It means she’s willing to bargain. They can be quite conniving—though I suppose this one seems <i>benevolent</i> enough.” She paused, rubbing her forehead. “It’s hard to believe something like this is happening in my lifetime.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you mean Null?” Xayla asked, completely lost as to where this conversation was heading.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele set aside her teacup, her expression turning cool and serious. “Your Grace, I cannot stress how important it is for you to answer me truthfully. Despite whatever you may believe, whatever you’ve been told, the fate of this kingdom still hangs in the balance.” She leaned forward. “How do you know that name?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla withered under the priestess’ gaze. “Uh, Null? A little help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Xayla,” Null said, materializing from the aether at her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele gasped, nearly jumping from her seat as she fumbled for her spectacles. “By the Mother!” She circled the ethereal entity, studying her intently. Carefully, she reached out and ran her fingers through Null’s form, leaving wisps of chromatic vapor trailing in her wake. The specter repaired herself just as quickly. “How can this be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla only gawked. How did Vestele know about Null? And what in the blighted ruins was she so concerned about?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can confirm that it was indeed Avalia who contacted Xayla,” Null said, seeming unfazed by Vestele’s prodding. She floated in place, turning to face the priestess as she spoke. “However, it is also true that Avalia is no more. Priestess: I can only surmise that your belief stems from an event that happened many ages ago. Analysis suggests it’s probable that Avalia was defeated and forced to withdraw from the world, but she did not die at that time. Indeed, her death was a more recent event; she gave the last of her power to save your people from the Blin assault. I am certain of this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Astounding,</i>” Vestele said in awe. “Esteemed Emissary, what more can you tell us of the Holy Mother?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Regrettably, little more information is available to me at this time,” Null said. “As I have already informed Xayla: subsequent to Avalia’s passing, I no longer have access to many of my previous memories. I expect your knowledge of this subject, and others, likely far exceeds my own.”</span>
<br><br> 
<span>The priestess sighed and returned to her seat, stowing away her spectacles. “I’m getting on in age,” she said. “I suppose I should know better than to get my hopes up by now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hesitated. “Vestele, I don’t mean to interrupt, but—how do you know about Null? Or that Avalia died, for that matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele glanced at Xayla, started to speak, then shook her head and turned back to Null. “We’ll get to that. First—Esteemed Emissary, I must be absolutely certain: the entity who contacted Xayla was truly <i>Avalia</i>? At no point was she approached by a Fae?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>A Fae?!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am certain,” Null said decisively. “My records indicate no contact by Fae.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla did a double take, looking between Vestele and the floating specter. What did Fae have to do with anything?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fae—they’re something like castoffs,” Vestele said, acknowledging Xayla’s confusion. “Shells. Husks. Fragments that broke off from what remained of Avalia’s spirit, traveled through the Void, and made their way here to our world. Often they have her memories. Rarely do they care for us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla raised an eyebrow. That sounded ominous. “Wait—you’re talking about the same Fae from the folktales, right?” She shook her head, trying to reconcile the connection. “But what would they have to do with… fragments of Avalia’s spirit?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele paused, seeming to gather her thoughts. “Hmm, where to begin,” she murmured. Xayla waited, giving her time to collect herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Analysis indicates my expected contribution to the current conversation has diminished to near-zero,” Null said. “Unless you require further assistance, I will cease projecting this avatar to conserve power reserves.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh—okay,” Xayla said uncertainly. Null had such a strange way of speaking at times. “Thank you, Null. You’ll still be around if I need you, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative,” Null said, vanishing just as abruptly as she appeared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele gazed at the now-empty space where Null had been, then turned her attention back to Xayla. “Tell me, what do you already know?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla considered the question. “Honestly? I always assumed they were just stories and fables,” she admitted. “Though I did find it curious how abruptly those tales fell out of favor. According to my research, anyway. Did something happen around the time of Arminel’s Conquest?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele frowned. “You’re not the first to make the connection. It’s one of our greatest failings. We should have been more careful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Faith, dear,” Vestele said. She gave a curt laugh. “Or rather the Seekers, if you want to be precise. And bear in mind—I had no part in those decisions. No more than your part in founding Avendal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Seekers. Xayla turned the words over in her mind. An order of monks administered by the Faith who honed their magical acuity to its limits. They identified those with innate magical talent at a young age, ensuring proper training and placement within society. The Veilwyrd also used them to hunt down rogue mages.</span>
<br><br/>
<span>“I thought the Seekers were—” she began.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, they are,” Vestele interrupted. “That just wasn’t their original purpose.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla felt a flicker of anger rise in her chest. She tried to push it down—intellectually, she knew the High Priestess wasn’t the one deserving of her ire. But the question still burned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Vestele?” she said carefully. “Please don’t take this the wrong way, but how <i>dare</i> the Faith perpetuate such a lie to our people all this time? If you believed Avalia to be dead—then <i>why</i>?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele winced. “It’s a fair question,” she said. “One I wrestled with myself when I was ordained. I understand your anger—I do. But when you find yourself in a position like ours, you’re forced to choose. On one hand: tradition and stability. On the other—who knows what chaos might be unleashed if the common people learned the truth?” She paused, meeting Xayla’s eyes. “I always believed the core teachings remained true, regardless of Avalia’s absence. And if that’s so, then what harm do a few well-intentioned lies cause if they give people hope? Am I wrong to want that for them—hope, in the face of such a bleak and unforgiving world?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla glanced away and let out a tense breath. The reasoning made sense, even if it didn’t sit right with her. “We can revisit the subject later,” she said, steering the conversation elsewhere. “What more can you tell me about the Fae? You seemed genuinely worried earlier—are they dangerous?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Remember how I said they were like fragments of Avalia, cast off from her essence?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shifted, curling her feet beneath her. Xayla found herself mirroring the motion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bear in mind, our knowledge is far from complete,” the priestess continued. “But the Fae… being severed from Avalia’s spirit seems to deprive them of whatever sustenance they need to survive. So they feed on our essence instead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla felt a chill crawl up her spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not all of them are malicious. One saved us once—she called herself Lucia. You’d know the event as ‘The Reaffirmation.’ During the height of the Akharic Wars, she came to us claiming to be Avalia. With her aid, we cast out the Akhari—and their dark god.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s blood ran cold. “<i>Their what?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a hushed whisper. “Their dark god. <i>Mor Kharath.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A faint prickling sensation brushed the back of Xayla’s mind—fleeting, barely there. She shook her head. The name felt strangely familiar, though she was certain she’d never encountered it before—not in her studies, nor anywhere else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele waved a hand. “A tale for another time. Where was I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lucia?” Xayla ventured. “Fae feeding off our souls?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The priestess nodded. “You asked about folklore? Well, if you view the stories from the right perspective, then you’ll see it clearly enough. In the stories, Fae blessed villages in exchange for humble offerings. Yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded. “That doesn’t sound so bad.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it doesn’t,” Vestele replied. “Not until you look closer. Not until you read the right accounts. Perhaps you’ve heard the tale of a man who dreamed of restoring Avendal to its former glory? They say he led the largest army ever assembled and marched it over the Plains of Ruin to retake our ancestral lands from the hordes once and for all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s eyes widened. “You mean General Rolfus Arminel?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The one and the same,” Vestele confirmed. “Sixty years of protracted war. Every gain offset by equal or greater losses. Countless lives lost—all for nothing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shook her head ruefully. “I’m going to guess he didn’t die peacefully in his sleep, as the histories claim?” She paused. “Though I suppose if you’re already rewriting history to erase the Fae, you might as well clean up Arminel’s death while you’re at it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is as you say,” Vestele said, shaking her head with a sad smile. “The truth is far more sinister. It wasn’t dreams of glory that blinded the general to his folly—it was a Fae named <i>Cyrae</i>. She promised him victory in exchange for the souls of those he slew, and of those who died in battle. Over the years, Arminel became increasingly obsessed with what he viewed as his destiny, sending his forces on ever riskier assaults to maintain her favor. But Cyrae never intended to grant him victory—she only desired sustenance. She was careful to keep the scales balanced, knowing Arminel would never return home in defeat when victory seemed just within reach. Eventually, his younger brother Kydus—the first Seeker—learned of Cyrae and her treachery. He assassinated the general and sealed the Fae in the very spear he shoved through his brother’s back. There she remains to this day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They sat in eerie silence as Xayla absorbed the tale. It made more sense than the historical account—especially given everything else she’d learned. She’d always wondered how a brilliant general could have been fool enough to wage a losing war for sixty years.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But that doesn’t answer my question,” she said after a time. “What does that have to do with folklore?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shrugged. “Cyrae was the worst by far. Most Fae weren’t so bad, to hear it told.” She paused, her expression darkening. “That is, until you consider tales like the desperate farmer who flayed his children alive and drowned them in their own blood—all because a Fae convinced him it necessary to prevent a bad harvest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s stomach turned. The image was grotesque—horrifying. She struggled to find words. “That’s… monstrous.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Seekers were founded to hunt down the Fae,” Vestele said. “To seal them, bind them, or destroy them if at all possible. Those that couldn’t be destroyed were locked away—bound into mundane objects and cast into the sea, or buried in deep chasms beneath the earth. Then all records were purged, to ensure they’d never be found again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t understand,” Xayla said, confused. “If you believed I was under the influence of a Fae, then why—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Need I remind you that you wear the Crown, Your Grace?” Vestele interrupted. “What could I have done? Any brash action on our part would have thrown the kingdom into chaos just as surely as the Fae. After your assault on the Blin, all that was left was to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla considered her words carefully. “It’s obvious you care deeply about our people,” she said after a moment, studying Vestele. “And I get the impression you wish you could do more. Am I wrong?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A smirk began to form on Vestele’s face, but it quickly faded. “What exactly are you suggesting?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have so many questions,” Xayla said. “You know things I don’t, yet I get the sense you feel just as much in the dark as I am.” She paused, catching the priestess’ solemn nod. “I want to change that. In time. But there’s so much work to be done first, and even though the challenges ahead seem insurmountable, I still have hope. I want…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla trailed off, searching for the right words. That familiar feeling stirred within her—the one she’d felt when witnessing the devastation wrought by the Blin. When she’d watched Ari fall to his attackers and poured everything she had into saving him. The same conviction that had driven her all her life: her relentless pursuit of lost knowledge, her determination to restore what had been forgotten, her unwavering belief that the kingdom could be better.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But now she understood it more clearly than ever. She saw the suffering around her—the <i>wrong</i> of it all—and felt an unshakeable resolve to set it right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I want to end the blights,” she said, meeting Vestele’s eyes. “Not just survive them until the next one—<i>end them</i>. For good. Our people shouldn’t have to live like this. I don’t know if it’s even possible. But I have to try. And I can’t do it alone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She held the priestess’ gaze unflinchingly. “Will you help me?”</span>
<br><br>   
<span>Vestele sat in silence for a long moment, her eyes glistening. When she finally spoke, her voice was thick with emotion. “Your Grace… I’d all but given up hope.” She paused, drawing a steadying breath and wiping at her eyes. “You have my support—completely and without reservation. Whatever you need, it’s yours.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla stepped onto the makeshift podium with Ari and Cove—one of her new Veilwyrd guards—positioned behind her, Vestele to her right. Her royal guard formed a protective line between them and the gathered crowd.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“People of Castletown!” she called out. “Citizens of Avendal! The Crown and the Faith stand united before you. We know your plight—you’re frightened, you’re hungry, you fear for your families and your children. But we will not abandon you in your time of need. As the teachings say: it is always darkest before the dawn. Together—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It happened in an instant. Someone slammed into her from behind, driving the air from her lungs. She crashed hard against the wooden platform, her head snapping back against the boards. Screams erupted from the crowd. Soldiers barked frantic orders. An ice barrier materialized inches from her face. She tried to push herself up, but hands seized her legs and yanked her backward off the platform. She hit the brick walkway hard just as an explosion tore through the far side of the podium.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla clutched her ears, gasping for breath. Just as she regained her bearings, Ari dove in beside her with Vestele at his side. The priestess curled up behind the wooden platform for cover.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s happening?!” Xayla shouted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stay down!” Ari commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace! Come with me! We have to get you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A bomb! He has another bomb!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Before she could react, a pair of arms had her by the shoulders and she was dragged into a nearby building. She dove forward and tensed up, expecting another explosion. None came.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla! Are you alright?" Ari, calling to her from the doorway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I—I think so,” she managed, her voice shaky. “Hit my head. Some cuts and bruises. What’s happening out there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stay here,” Ari said as three guardsmen poured into the building. He pointed to Cove. “You! Keep her safe!” he barked, then ran off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla pushed herself up against the wall. One of the guardsmen offered her a flask, which she used to rinse away the dirt and blood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had been such a fool. Such a fool, to think this would end well.</span>
<br><br>
