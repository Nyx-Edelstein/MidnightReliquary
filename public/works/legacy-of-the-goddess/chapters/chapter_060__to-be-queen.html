<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;"><b>Excerpt from <i>Avalian Governance: A Treatise</i></b></div>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">(Updated 35th of First Brisk, 547 CE)</div>
<br>
<span>While the monarch holds ultimate authority in all matters, the Council exists to advise the Crown and represent the concerns of both the Noble Houses and the common people. The monarch’s authority is delegated as follows:</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Queen’s Law has the duty of maintaining the written law; determining when a crime has been committed, who is responsible, and to what degree; and adjudicating disagreements between private citizens. They have the power to delegate any and all of these responsibilities to magistrates throughout the kingdom, who ultimately answer to the Queen’s Law. They may also administer court in the absence of the monarch. The position is currently held by Chancellor Nyllara Zan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Queen’s Justice has the duty of enforcing the law and upholding public order; prosecuting potential criminals and arguing their guilt before the law; and determining the punishments for breaking the law. They delegate this power to various administrative groups throughout the kingdom, and may also administer court in the absence of the monarch. The position is currently held by Chancellor Adresin Lotan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lord General is the penultimate authority over the military. They administer the outposts, command the armed forces, and oversee logistics. Their role on the council is to request and provision goods and services for military use, and to ensure the monarch and the council members are aware of military concerns. The position is currently held by Wymar Letholdus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The House of Nobles consists of representatives from each of the twenty Noble Houses. While representatives may attend council meetings to voice their house’s interests before the Crown, attendance is not compulsory. Each year, they elect a Head from among themselves to attend all meetings year-round. Countess Lensa Oda currently holds this position.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The House of Commons consists of twelve influential citizens elected by the common people to represent their interests. Every two years, those seeking a position may petition the Queen’s Law for candidacy. Twelve candidates are then chosen by moot—a gathering where citizens of Castletown voice their support for their preferred representatives. The Queen’s Justice oversees and validates the results. The Head of the House of Commons oversees tax collection, manages the kingdom’s financial affairs, and advocates for the citizenry before the Crown and the courts. Prime Counselor Taetus currently holds this position.</span>

<br>
<span><i><u>1st of Last Brisk, 548 CE:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>And so begins a new year. Let us hope our good fortune holds, and that the Blight is ended swiftly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much to do. Just taking a moment to jot down my thoughts…</span>
<br><br>
<span>During the attack, Arlinkar suffered a host of critical, life-threatening wounds—organ damage, several shattered bones, the works. I healed the worst of it and kept him from dying (also cured his bloodrage affliction—praise the Goddesses). He still spent several days bedridden while the Healing took effect, and was only able to walk around with a cane the day before my coronation. Because of the frankly insane amount of magic I used while empowered, his recovery has been spectacular. He should be in fighting shape in a little over a week—assuming he eats enough and doesn’t overexert himself. I want to get him working as soon as possible, but we can’t risk breaking the Healing effect. I don’t know how well he’s holding up mentally. Haven’t asked. He’s hard to read.</span>
<br><br>
<span>My own wounds from the battle were comparatively minor and have already healed, but the magical exhaustion was another matter entirely. I’m past the worst of it now, but even approaching my limit again while recovering could permanently damage my affinity. Given my track record with control, I’d rather not risk it. Full recovery should take another three weeks, assuming I don’t do anything foolish in the meantime.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I’ve massively increased castle security since the assassination attempt. No one enters or leaves without official business and an armed escort. It’s been a challenge—the number of petitioners has skyrocketed, as expected. I’ve ordered the watchtowers manned around the clock, all entrances under constant surveillance, and routine patrols with continuous communication between posts. Hopefully it’ll be enough to deter further attacks until we can root out any remaining enemy agents.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everything is on fire, and I have no idea what to do about it. The loss of Jarrensvale, the ongoing war effort, and the sheer death toll—estimated at 30% of the total population—has dealt a massive blow to our infrastructure. Everything south of the floodplains and east of the Avali River has been abandoned, at least until the Blight ends. If each region weren’t mostly self-sufficient, this would be completely insurmountable. As it stands, holding things together in the coming months is going to be incredibly difficult.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The influx of refugees from the eastern lands and the floodplains is putting a heavy strain on Castletown and the Royal Province. We’ve granted the Noble Houses significant tax breaks and issued bonds in exchange for housing and feeding refugees, but they’re at their limit. There’s scarcely enough food to go around, and even with heavy rationing, this arrangement isn’t sustainable—not in the middle of Brisk when food production is minimal and supplies are limited. If we don’t find a solution before supplies run out, the city could face revolt. My counselors estimate we have 3-4 months before that happens.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The crime rate has surged dramatically despite enforcement crackdowns—most of it economically motivated. Assault and petty theft are the worst offenses. The streets are decidedly unsafe, with constant threats of assault and other violent crimes. Those who can defend themselves or afford armed guards manage well enough, but everyone else faces considerable danger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There were isolated incidents of rioting and pillaging in the days immediately following the attack. Many of the offenders were rounded up and publicly executed at Wymar’s command—grim and unfortunate, but the action served as a clear message and effective deterrent. Hopefully that will remain the case when he leaves for the front.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Banditry is also on the rise outside the city. Leaderless bands of Blin are still ravaging the countryside, adding to the ever-present threat of fiend encroachment. As a consequence, caravan traffic has taken a hit and it has become that much more expensive to travel and transport goods. Nominally, forces have been dispatched to counter this, but I fear it won’t be enough. Still, I don’t have any ideas, and until Talus has been reclaimed and the hordes repelled, the main concern right now is the war effort. Larger towns will likely hold out, but smaller villages will continue to sustain losses and the death toll will continue to rise until the bands have been eliminated. Undoubtedly, this will have cascading effects on long-term production and stability.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As for reconstruction and the war effort, I’ve left those matters entirely to the Council and Wymar respectively. They seem to be managing well enough without me mucking things up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I should probably make some public appearances, but fear of assassins has me paralyzed. All the more reason to hope for Ari’s speedy recovery. I’m considering a couple public speeches and a few private meetings with the nobility—in the safety of the castle, of course. But I know much more needs to be done on this front, and I’m not sure where to begin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A fair number among the populace seem to believe I’m capable of much more than I actually am—that I’m simply indifferent to their plight. I’m not sure how much I should say about my limitations. I’d really rather not address it at all, but…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla buried her face in her hands, slouching back at her desk. Even in the rare moments of peace and solitude she managed to find lately, she couldn’t escape the constant work and stress. She had been second-guessing herself endlessly. Every idea she had, she turned over and over in her mind, reconsidering from every angle. She was terrified—terrified of doing the wrong thing, of failing to do the right thing, or worst of all, of inadvertently interfering with whatever plans Avalia had set in motion and making everything worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She wasn’t even sure it was safe to write as much in her own diary.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On some level, she knew it was silly. How could she be so vain as to believe herself capable of derailing plans set in motion by <i>the Holy Mother herself</i>? Hadn’t Avalia trusted her enough to appoint her as her personal champion? Logically, she knew that doing anything was better than doing nothing. Yet somehow, that only made it worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She knew she couldn’t keep this up for much longer. Too much was expected of her. She had to act.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She rubbed her face and pulled the next parchment from the seemingly endless pile. Reports of a rogue squadron of mages who had fled during the initial assault on the city. For those blessed by the Goddesses to abandon their duty was the gravest of offenses, both against the Crown and the Faith. Normally, hunting them down would fall to the Veilwyrd. But given the Veilwyrd’s current state…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla thought back to Wymar’s request. She had approved it without thinking—how daft of her! They couldn’t afford to waste the Veilwyrd on the front lines like that. There was far too much that needed doing elsewhere.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She hoped it wasn’t too late. She set the parchment aside and resolved to speak with Wymar again at the first opportunity.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Deep breath.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, how she wished she had someone to confide in—someone she could rely on. Null was proving less than useless more often than not. Anli was missing. And Nira…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hoped Ari might eventually fill that role in some capacity. He could never replace Nira… but with someone as competent as him watching her back, she could at least feel safe leaving the castle. Still, it would be a few more days before he was fully recovered, and he wasn’t exactly in the best place himself right now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was Wymar. He was family, and she trusted him with her life. He’d always been open and honest with her, and she respected him deeply. But he was already shouldering the entire war effort—she couldn’t justify burdening him further unless she had no other choice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She supposed Lensa had always been a positive force in her life, for better or worse. Lensa had been Xayla’s tutor since she was a young girl, and even now acted as a de-facto aide and guide in matters of high society. The poor woman had been saddled with her when Father gave up knowing what to do with his wayward daughter. She had always been stern and… well, unforgiving. But Xayla trusted her. Perhaps she would have some insight as to how she should proceed in her new role?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then there was Counselor Taetus. For all his faults, even Xayla had to admit he was good at his job. There was a reason Father had respected him, after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Perhaps…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla knocked at the door to Ari’s quarters. A moment later, the door swung open.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Ari said, rubbing his eyes. “Your… Xayla. Please, come in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I hope I’m not interrupting,” Xayla said, offering a conciliatory smile. “It’s not a bad time, is it? I can come back later.” She’d been certain he would be awake at this hour.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it’s alright,” he said, retreating to take a seat on his bed. She entered behind him and pulled the door shut.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla waited, but he offered nothing more. She was beginning to notice a pattern. Finding no invitation forthcoming, she took the liberty of seating herself at the small desk in the corner of his room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She cleared her throat. “So. How are you holding up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shrugged. “I’m fine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Completely inscrutable, as ever.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla tapped her fingers against her leg, letting out a slow breath. He couldn’t possibly be making this more difficult on purpose. “Listen, I know the past few days have been rough,” she said. “So much has happened. So much to process…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can only imagine what you’re going through right now…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…what you must be feeling…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stiffened. What <i>was</i> he feeling?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, what I’m trying to say is—I’m worried about you. Keeping everything bottled up inside isn’t healthy. Maybe it would help to talk to someone about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” he said, relaxing again. “Alright. Thank you. I will.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla raised an eyebrow. He met her gaze briefly, then looked away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You don’t have to lie to me. It’s alright. I’m not expecting anything from you. I’m just worried, is all. I think you should talk with someone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“With respect,” he said, “I don’t exactly have anyone to talk to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Xayla said, suddenly wanting to vanish. How thoughtless of her. “I can relate to that,” she said quietly. “You know, since…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother take me,</i> Xayla thought.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen,” Xayla said. “I’m planning to speak with the High Priestess soon. I can arrange a meeting for you as well, after I’ve had a chance to discuss…” She trailed off, meeting Ari’s eyes with a purposeful look. “I know you probably don’t want to hear it, but it might actually help. I’ve always found her to be rather insightful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sighed, falling back on his bed. “I appreciate the offer. I really do.” He paused. “I guess it wouldn’t hurt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla clasped her hands together. Oh, he accepted? “Great!” she said, feeling a touch relieved.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari said nothing, only continued staring up at the ceiling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla stood, shaking her head. That was more than enough awkwardness for one day.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think Null can compel creatures like Wulfkin and Kaiserok?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla blinked, caught off guard by the sudden question. “I’m sorry, what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can Null compel creatures like Wulfkin and Kaiserok to attack people?” he clarified. “Because that sounds like it could be pretty useful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla considered that as she stepped towards the door. “I’m not sure, actually. That’s… a good question. I’ll be sure to ask her about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m leaving now,” Xayla said, with all the grace of a three-legged kippongu.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. Thanks for coming by.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Oh, you don’t say!” Xayla said, feigning interest as she stabbed at her food. She had lost track of the conversation some time ago and couldn’t bring herself to care. As long as she kept up appearances, the hens were content to cluck away. Lensa caught her eye from across the table, and Xayla turned her attention, careful not to give too much away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Of course Lensa would see the dinner invitation as another opportunity to refine Xayla’s social graces. She hadn’t expected the full complement of guests, nor did she particularly want them here, but she couldn’t very well turn them away once they’d arrived—as Lensa well knew. How much longer would she have to endure this torment?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The table fell silent, all eyes on her. Mother’s mercy—someone had asked her a question, hadn’t they?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla dabbed at her mouth with a napkin, buying herself a moment. “I’m sorry, could you repeat that? I didn’t quite catch it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The younger girls giggled amongst themselves. Lensa regarded her coolly. Across the table to Xayla’s left, Efla spoke up. Or was it Mave?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, Your Grace, you needn’t be shy! Especially at your age—it’s only natural.” The older woman winked and nudged the younger girl to her right, prompting another round of giggling laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla blinked. “Pardon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Arlinkar,</i> dear,” Efla-slash-Mave said. “The Hero of Castletown! Nipa mentioned she heard that you two were… <i>you know</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is it true, Your Grace?” / "Is it?” / “Tell us!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The color drained from Xayla’s face. Her mouth refused to work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa stood abruptly. “That’s quite enough for now,” she said. “My apologies, Your Grace. The girls can be rather overeager.” She gave the older woman a pointed look.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww, but we were just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—That’s enough, Nipa,” Efla (Mave?) said, rolling her eyes and jabbing a finger at the younger girl. “Listen to your mother.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, ma’am,” Nipa said, feigning a frown. “Sorry, Mother.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll get them out of your hair, sweetie,” the older woman said smugly. “Efla, do you mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not at all,” definitely-Efla said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa only smiled and bowed her head. “Thank you, Mother.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Come along now,” Mave said. “The queen and your mother have important business to discuss!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla sat frozen in place, waiting for them to leave. The three girls and two older women filed out of the hall, leaving her alone with Lensa and Sera—the woman who was to be her new handmaiden.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Lensa asked with a smirk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Xayla said, aghast. “It’s not… we’re not… there’s nothing…” She set her napkin down over her plate, taking a breath. “Just—no.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A shame,” Lensa said with a tisk. “He’d make a fine consort. You do know you’ll need to bear children eventually? Or did you learn nothing from the succession crisis?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gah!” Xayla buried her face in her arms. This was <i>not</i> the conversation she wanted to be having right now! The kingdom was on the brink of ruin and all they could think about was who had access to her loins? “Lensa, I appreciate—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Spare me the excuses,” she said. “We all have to do our duty eventually. Sera can help—I know you’d prefer that anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s head shot up, unable to believe what she was hearing. She gaped at Lensa, slack-jawed, then glanced briefly at Sera—whose face had to be as red as her own. “Lensa! That’s enough! I won’t hear any more of this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” Lensa said dismissively, waving a hand. “We’ll table it for now. Like everything else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you serious right now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh? My apologies. Did the Princess finally decide to take action?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am your <i>queen</i>!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla recoiled, speechless.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I thought not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lensa, please… it’s just… it’s so hard… I never thought I’d have to…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Save the tears, Princess. We don’t have time for your childishness.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was right—by the Mother, but she was. Xayla composed herself and sat up. “I know," she said. “That’s actually why I asked you here in the first place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa leaned forward, her interest piqued. “Oh? Do tell.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I wanted to ask your advice,” Xayla said. “I think things would go more smoothly if I had more people around me that I could trust—to help guide my decisions and carry them out once they’re made.” She felt foolish the moment the words left her mouth. It made far more sense in her head. She could already anticipate Lensa’s response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dearie, look at me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s precisely what I’ve been trying to tell you this whole time. Or haven’t you been listening? The Council is <i>exactly that</i>. You need not fear us—you need not try and hide your inexperience, as if you even could. We expect you to flounder, at least at first. That’s <i>why</i> there’s a Council in the first place. Did you think you were the first royal to sit the throne with no business being there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her words stung, leaving Xayla momentarily speechless. Yet—that made far too much sense. Was the world allowed to make that much sense? She was pretty sure it wasn’t. That had to violate some fundamental law of nature.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To your credit, you recognize your own incompetence, and that matters a great deal. But you want my advice? I’ve already given it. <i>Stability</i> is the primary function of the monarchy, and stability is least at risk when there is a clear and unambiguous line of succession. The rest is just window dressing and philosophical nuance. Will you ever be a competent ruler? Only the Goddesses know. Most aren’t; your father was an exception. But so long as you trust in your council and put your kingdom first, we will prevail. As we always have.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla had no idea what else to say. “…Thank you, Lensa.” She was decidedly not ready to deal with that topic right now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is my pleasure to serve, Your Grace,” Lensa said, bowing her head. She paused, considering her words carefully. “One more thing—and this is important. Don’t allow your subjects to question your authority. You must project confidence and decisiveness at all times. The Council exists to advise and assist you, but we cannot dispute or overrule you once you’ve made a decision. Remember that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s eyes narrowed. “But that doesn’t make sense. You just said—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa smiled. “Yes, you’ve always been a sharp one. You can figure it out. Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh. Once she looked at it from the right angle, it became clear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It goes back to stability, doesn’t it? When I’m faced with a decision the Council can’t resolve, it’s usually better to choose decisively between good options than to do nothing. The act of deciding matters more than picking the perfect choice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Got it in one,” Lensa said, beaming. “There may be hope for you yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Wymar?” Xayla called down the hall. “A moment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lord General dismissed an aide with a wave and approached, bowing respectfully. “Your Grace. Is something the matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not quite. I wanted to discuss the Veilwyrd deployment with you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar frowned. “Can’t it wait until the meeting? We’re less than an hour out.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s why I’m here—to discuss it beforehand. As a courtesy.” She gestured to an empty room across the hall. “Shall we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly,” he said. “After you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla entered, and Wymar closed the door behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took in a breath. She could do this. “Listen. I don’t want to deploy the Veilwyrd on the front lines.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar grunted, his expression tightening. “With respect, Your Grace—I’m not going to throw them around like fodder. I only mean to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla drew herself up, doing her best to channel Lensa. Father, even. “That is <i>enough</i>, Wymar. I’ve heard your case, and I’ve decided against it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar’s expression flickered through several emotions too quickly for her to track. Finally, he settled into a firm scowl befitting a general, standing at attention with his fist pressed over his chest in salute. “As you command, Your Grace. Was there anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well, that was easier than she—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null’s voice echoed in her mind. <i>I’m detecting an unusually elevated emotional response pattern from Wymar. Despite his controlled demeanor, analysis indicates he is hiding intense anger.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm. Wymar?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Xayla said, wincing. By the Mother, what was she doing? This was the exact opposite of Lensa’s advice. “I didn’t mean to offend you. I’ve been trying so hard to fill the space Father left behind, and the last thing I want is to damage our relationship. But I can’t have even you questioning my authority.” She paused, searching for the right words. “I value your advice—I want to hear you out. But once I’ve made a decision, I need you to accept it, even if you disagree.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar’s expression softened, and he let out a short laugh. “Taking lessons from Lensa, I see.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>For the third time today, Xayla wanted nothing more than for the ground to swallow her whole. <i>Why, why, why…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry about it,” he said with a wave of his hand. “I trust you have a plan?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re too forgiving, Wymar,” she managed to say. If people kept being so sensible, she was sure to wake up at any moment. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla? We’re family, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She paused, caught off-guard by the question. After a moment’s consideration, she nodded. “Yes. Of course we are.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then I have your back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla felt her throat tighten. “Thank you, Wymar,” she said quietly, turning to wipe her eyes. She hadn’t expected that—Wymar had never been the sentimental type. “It means more than I can say. I’m grateful to have someone I can count on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Always,” he said with a smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla felt a laugh escape her. Why had she been so worried?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar cleared his throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right, the plan,” Xayla said. “I was thinking we could deploy the Veilwyrd to the countryside—have them combat the bandits and roving Blin bands. There’s also a rogue squadron of mages out west that needs dealing with. I’m no strategist, but it seems obvious their skills would be far more effective against smaller, high-value targets. They could actually make a real impact that way. And despite what you’ve said, I have trouble believing thirty-eight individuals—however talented—would make much difference against the hordes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He grunted at that. “You’re underestimating the effect that fielding elite troops has on morale. Soldiers fight more fiercely and with more confidence when the monsters are on <i>their</i> side.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla raised her palms. “If you don’t believe it’s workable—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I didn’t say it won’t work,” he said, holding up a hand. “You’re right—it would be more effective, and we can’t spare anyone else for the task. But that’s the problem: we can’t confirm their loyalty. Who do we trust to hunt down traitors when we don’t know who the traitors are? The last thing we need is sending wolves to catch wolves.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hesitated. “I was thinking I could interrogate them. Myself, actually.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar’s expression darkened. “Absolutely not,” he said flatly. “I don’t care if you’re the Queen or Avalia herself—I’m not letting you anywhere near them. What makes you think you’ll do any better than my senior staff?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla chose her words carefully. “I understand your concern, but I wouldn’t suggest this if I wasn’t confident in the outcome. I can’t share all the details yet, but… there are certain abilities I’ve gained since Avalia’s empowerment. I’m still learning to use them properly, and for now, it’s best if this remains between us—at least until I can speak with the High Priestess. Can I trust you to keep this confidential?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “Of course. Go on—I’m listening.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m afraid that’s all I can say right now. You’ll just have to trust me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar studied her carefully. Xayla held his gaze, doing her best to project a confidence she didn’t quite feel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” he said finally. “I’ll trust you on this. But we need to move quickly—I leave for the front in two days.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Absolutely,” Xayla said. “And if it doesn’t pan out, we’ll go with your original plan. Fair enough?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He smiled. “Fair enough, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“I’ve made my decision,” Xayla said, addressing the nine members of the Council gathered in the small chamber. “I won’t be leaving for Arikton. And regarding the Veilwyrd, we will not be deploying them to the front lines. Rather, we’ll be sending them against the roving Blin bands, and other high priority targets. If all goes according to plan, that is.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chancellor Nyllara glanced about the room. “That doesn’t seem wise, Your Grace. I can’t imagine—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve already discussed this with Her Grace,” Wymar interrupted. “I’m confident we can proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two exchanged glances.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah,” Nyllara said, taken aback. “I didn’t realize. Forgive me, Your Grace—I was wrong to speak out of turn.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded to the Chancellor, smiling to herself. “Which brings me to the next item. I have decided to accept the Lynx’s offer.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Stunned silence followed. Even Wymar looked surprised. Perhaps she should have eased into that one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>While Avendal and the Akhari people had maintained a tenuous peace for ages, relations had deteriorated in recent years. Raiding parties began sacking southern villages, slipping through mountain passes to evade patrols. The groups appeared uncoordinated with no ties to any Akhari governing body—though what remained of their once-unified nation was unclear. Messengers sent to demand the raids cease rarely returned. As attacks grew bolder and more frequent, Last Bastion constructed makeshift prison camps for captives until they overflowed. In desperation, Father changed military policy: engage all Akhari parties on sight, take no prisoners. The raids stopped, but so did all trade and peaceful relations.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla could only imagine the tangled web of their internal politics. And there was another thought that stuck with her—could these “Sunseekers” be the very group that had worked with Vesyrn? If Null’s account of Nira’s conversation with Vian was accurate, the timing would align. Wouldn’t that be something?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I realize this may sound brash, or even foolish,” Xayla said. “But I ask that you hear me out. I harbor no illusions that their offer of aid stems from altruism or kindness. However, I believe it quite likely that this group acts out of political desperation. If so, we may exploit their position just as surely as they hope to exploit ours. I know who we’re dealing with, and we must tread carefully. Nevertheless, I believe it would be most unwise to refuse any legitimate offer of aid given the kingdom’s current state—no matter how unlikely it may seem. At minimum, gathering additional information will cost us little. A single rider to escort an envoy to Last Bastion, and from there we may continue correspondence via Scry towers. Depending on how those discussions unfold, we can determine whether and how we should proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Murmurs and whispers broke out across the chamber. Xayla held her breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was Lensa who finally spoke up. “Sounds sensible enough to me, Your Grace. What message should I send?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes!</i> No one was yelling at her, and she hadn’t melted into a pile of embarrassment and inadequacy—yet. She had to stay composed—celebrating could wait. She took a moment to think it through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Address it directly to ‘the Lynx’,” Xayla said. “‘I, Xayla, Queen of Avendal, thank you for your offer. We will gladly hear you out. Come yourself, or send an envoy to Last Bastion. We will provide you with quarter and lodging while we arrange a meeting. I look forward to further discussion, and hope our peoples may aid one another in these dark and trying times.’ How’s that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa finished scribbling her note before looking up. “Flowery, and somewhat unwieldy. But I can work with it.” She winked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Countess,” Xayla said. “Moving on. Counselor Taetus?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus stepped forward, clearing his throat. “Yes, Your Grace?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla met his eyes and let the silence drag on for several moments longer than she should have. He shuffled in place, looking ill at ease. She was enjoying this too much.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Our people are threatened by famine and starvation; it is without a doubt the most urgent issue facing the kingdom, save for the war effort itself. Counselor: in my estimation, you’ve shown both initiative and competency in forestalling the crisis in Castletown, and are undoubtedly the most qualified man for the job. As such, I hereby charge you <i>personally</i> with overseeing the matter of food shortage throughout the whole of the kingdom. You have the full authority of the Crown to use any and all available resources, as it pertains to your charge.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus stood in a shocked stupor. He glanced around the room, to Nyllara, Wymar, and the other counselors. No one said a word.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Forgive me, Your Grace, but I was not expecting this,” he said finally. …And there was that infuriating grin of his. “You honor me beyond words. Thank you. I will see it done.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Wymar led Xayla down a corridor of the barracks where the Veilwyrd were being detained. “As you likely know, there were sixty-five Veilwyrd at large before the attack,” he said. “Since then, nine have been confirmed dead, eighteen are unaccounted for, and thirty-eight are being held here until we decide what to do with them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded along. She’d read the reports but hadn’t committed the exact numbers to memory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’ve separated them into three groups based on their chain of command. The first group—thirteen individuals—reported directly to Vian or Allanah. We’re assuming most, if not all, are loyal. Though I’ll admit, it’s far from certain. Traitors can operate at any level, so there may be one or two hidden among them.” He paused and motioned to a guard, who opened the way forward.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The second group—seven individuals—reported to Vesyrn. Given that most of the missing agents also answered to him, these seven are naturally under the greatest suspicion. I doubt they’re all disloyal, but I’d be shocked if there weren’t at least a few rats left behind.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The remaining eighteen are harder to classify. Their reporting structure is either unknown, undocumented, or falls outside normal Veilwyrd command. I’m honestly not sure what to make of them. Most are probably loyal, but I’d wager there’s some traitors hiding in that group as well.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They came to a halt at the top of a flight of stairs just as he finished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So,” Wymar said, turning to face her. “How do you want to go about this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hesitated. Truth be told, she hadn’t thought that far ahead—only confirming that Null would be able to help. “One at a time, I think? They should be restrained beforehand and Siphoned of magic. And I’d prefer armed guards present—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar held up a hand, shaking his head. “You misunderstand, Your Grace. Security is my concern. I just needed to know your approach to the interrogations. One at a time, then. Makes sense. Anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right, of course,” Xayla said, feeling her face flush. “No, that should be all. Just a few minutes alone with each of them to ask some questions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I recommend a more systematic approach to better ensure variable isolation,</i> came Null’s voice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar nodded, gesturing down the stairs. “After you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually!” Xayla said, “I just thought of something. Would you give me a moment to work out the details?”</span>
<br><br>
