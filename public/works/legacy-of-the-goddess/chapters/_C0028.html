<span>A merchant’s wagon at the back of a caravan heading from Hateno to Kakariko rolled along at a leisurely pace, driven by two palomino horses. The noonday sun shone overhead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Papa, can I drive now?” a boy asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not now,” the boy’s father said. “Maybe later, son. We need to keep pace with the caravan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link pouted. “Why not? I’m bored back here and I already finished all my work, just like you said. Please, papa?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine. If you promise to behave,” Karindal said mirthlessly. “But just for a few minutes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gleefully hopped up front, took the reins in his hands, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused. Something about this felt wrong. Very wrong. A sense of darkness and foreboding hung over him, like a great shadow looming above his head. His mouth felt dry. He swallowed, hard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… actually, I don’t think I’m ready for this,” he said, offering the reins back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Karindal refused them, giving Link that disapproving glare of his before glancing away with an exasperated sigh. Link wilted and sunk into his seat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, Ar… <i>Link.</i> You do have to learn eventually—I suppose now is as good a time as any. It’s not hard. Watch.” He placed one hand over both of Link’s and gestured with the other just ahead. “See that bend there? The horses will follow the road on their own, but we want to make sure we steer clear of that rock so they don’t stumble around it and we don’t damage the carriage by running over it. Got it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded in understanding. When they came up to the bend, he tugged the reins to the left, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Woah now! Easy does it,” Karindal said, taking the reins back as the wagon rocked back and forth uncomfortably for a second before settling again. “Gentle, now. Just a light touch is all you need.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link watched as his father set the wagon back on track with a gentle tug, and then another to correct course, before handing the reins back. “Here, try again. Hold steady for now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hesitantly, Link took the reins, nodding. The wagon made it around the bend and they traveled for another forty yards or so. Karindal then pointed ahead to a slight incline in the road ahead. “See that dip, just before the knoll? We want to slow down a touch before we get there. And how do we do that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I pull back on the reins?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Karindal nodded. “Gently. And keep a loose grip.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Okay,” Link said uneasily, scrunching his face up as he focused on the task at hand. He’d get it right this time for sure. As they neared, he waited until just the right moment, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tugged back gently on the reins. Just a light pull, causing the horses to slow their gait. He felt slack build in the reins as the wagon slowed, until a second or two later when the rope pulled taut again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Excellent,” Karindal said with a smile. “Just like that, son. See? Easy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link smiled, feeling a warm glow of satisfaction at Father’s approval.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But just as quickly, the smile faded. There was that sense of foreboding again. Something was wrong—he just couldn’t place it. It was like…</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was then that he saw it. A great shadow—small at first, but growing larger and darker as it sped towards them. A shrill cry rang out, and the wagon rocked violently as the great winged beast slammed into—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link startled awake, squinting bleary-eyed at the painful brightness that met him back in the waking world.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What in damnation was that dream about? He had nightmares fairly often, but nothing quite like that. He was… he was…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rubbed his eyes. It seemed so clear just then in his mind. But as he regained clarity and pushed through the haze, the memory of the dream left him just as quickly. He sat still, thinking about it for a long moment. It was about that day, back when… back when… except he hadn’t… but they still…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A shrill cry rang out in the distance, barely audible. If he wasn’t primed to hear it, he probably wouldn’t have noticed. Link immediately sprang into action, reaching for his bow, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Pain.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He fumbled, barely managing to extend the fingers on his right hand before fire and agony shot up his wounded arm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“KARGAROK!” he heard someone yell, followed shortly by a blaring horn. The fiendish cry rang out again, louder this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No. <i>No!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Pulse pounding, Link slid out the back of the wagon and turned his eyes to the sky, shielding them with his one good hand. There! A mass of black feathers, talons extended, bearing down from above with frightening speed. The Dread Shadow. The Sky Reaper.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kargarok.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Damnation, but he was too late! The beast crashed into the side of a wagon up ahead, sending splinters and debris flying. It perched atop the wreckage and raised a wing to buffet away a volley of thrown spears and arrows, shrugging away the attacks as if they were nothing. The fearsome beast then turned its attention upon its attackers, screeching with that horrible, shrill cry—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>VORP!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>—And then exploded into a shower of black feathers and gore as a luminous, green-runed block hurdled through the space it once occupied.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“YEAH! Take that, you ficking oversized parrot!” Ryn yelled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You show those fiends, girl!” Koja called after her exuberantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Dozens of others in the caravan took up the cry, cheering and applauding. A couple soldiers rushed her and hoisted her up on their shoulders as a small crowd gathered. She caught Link’s eye and winked with a thumbs up, the transfabrulator glinting in her hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link felt dizzy. He stood there, stunned, before he remembered to breathe. He took in a deep breath and shook his head slowly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, don’t worry, Link!” Ryn called to him. “We’re on top of it!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link could do nothing but gawk. He half-stumbled as someone brushed past him, running over to assist others who were checking the destroyed wagon. He came back to himself in that instant with a start. Someone could be in there still! He—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“All clear!” someone at the wagon yelled out. “Just cargo!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stumbled to a halt. He felt so utterly, completely…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Useless.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Worthless. Powerless to do anything but stand on the sidelines and watch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn caught his eye again, frowning. She hopped down and checked with Koja before heading over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh,” Link muttered to himself. Now she was worried about him again, and she’d want <i>talk</i> about it, and…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just ugh. He pivoted in place and headed back to his wagon. He knew what she’d say, but it didn’t matter. They were too slow. They got lucky. Someone could’ve been in that wagon, and if they were—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, wait!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Frustration nearly boiling over, he came to a halt and spun. “What?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn stopped and gasped, raising a hand to her chest. She gave him a hurt look, then one of intense anger before her expression softened. Link felt his cheeks begin to burn. On top of everything, here he was sticking his foot in his mouth. He felt like a complete and utter fool.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry, Ryn,” he said, sullen. “Listen, I didn’t mean to snap at you. I just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, it’s okay. I get it,” she said, stepping over. “Really, you don’t have to worry—we’ve got this! We’ve got your back.” She placed one soft hand on his wounded shoulder, cocking her head slightly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link leaned into her, hanging his head with a sigh. She kissed his forehead gently, and he felt some of the tension leave him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Want to talk about it?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grunted. “Not really. I was napping, and I heard its shriek in the distance just before the alarm sounded,” he said. “Went for my bow. If my arm weren’t… I could’ve …”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She narrowed her eyes at that, mouth drawn to a line. “No one got hurt. And you know that’s not what I meant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link had to resist the urge to groan. This was going exactly as he expected, and he didn’t have any outs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You saw what it did to that wagon, right?” He glanced over her shoulder, and she shut her eyes hard, turning her head to the side. “I know you did. Someone could’ve been in there!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Someone can always get hurt, Link,” Ryn predictably responded. “And do you honestly think an arrow or two would’ve stopped it? In case <i>you</i> hadn’t noticed, we had half a dozen soldiers shooting and lobbing spears at it. Didn’t even scratch the thing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ugh, why didn’t anyone ever listen? “Yes, I have in fact taken out a Kargarok at two-hundred fifty meters with a single arrow before, and I can do it again!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How many times?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stammered. “I mean… well, yes, you can argue that one time I got lucky, but—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—You got lucky. Once,” Ryn said, not letting him finish. “And now you’re using that as an excuse to beat yourself up for feeling like you can’t be the hero you think everyone expects you to be.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He winced. She wasn’t exactly wrong, but did she have to say it like that? “I mean…” he started, only to feel the wind leave his sails as Ryn glowered at him. He sighed, deflating. “Yeah… I suppose you’re right.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her being right didn’t make it hurt any less.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja strolled up a moment later. “Hey! What’d I miss?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged noncommittally.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja glanced to Ryn. “Oh,” she said with a frown. She paused, cocked her head, then perked up as she drew tall and crossed her arms. “Hey, captain! Don’t sweat it, yeah? It’s okay to take a breather. We’ve got this—The Party to Totally Lay Waste to all Evil, on the job!” She clapped him on the shoulder. The one that wasn’t injured.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sighed. “Yeah,” he said, glum. “That’s what Ryn said, more or less.” Koja turned back to Ryn and half-smiled, half-frowned. “—But yeah, thanks for the support,” he hastily added.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, I’m sure you’ll be back to normal before too long,” Koja said. “See? You’re already recovering.” She pointed at his fingers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link flexed them. Slowly. They still hurt and felt numb and unresponsive, but he could move them a little more now. “Yeah, I guess,” he said. “Not fast enough though, if you ask me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, that’s it!” Ryn said, throwing her hands up. “I’ve had enough of this.” She turned to Koja. “All good here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja mock saluted. “Yes, ma’am! Wagon’s lost, but Darial said we should be back on track within the hour, after plucking what’s left of the cucco and salvaging what can be salvaged.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right then,” Ryn said matter-of-factly. “You.” She jabbed a finger at Link’s chest. “You’re coming with me. We’re going to go for a ride, out scouting. Just the two of us. A nice, long ride, all by ourselves. And we’re going to <i>talk</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, is that right?” Koja snickered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn eyed her, then broke out into an impish grin. “Well, I’m sure we’ll get to talking eventually,” she said with a wink, meeting Link’s eyes as she ran her tongue along her teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gulped and took a surreptitious look around, face ablaze. No one, excepting Koja, seemed to take note. Koja for her part only gave an exaggerated wink-smile and a thumbs up as she turned and sauntered off. “Take care, you two! Don’t get into too much trouble out there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh… okay,” Link said sheepishly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well? You coming?” Ryn asked from a few paces away, unfastening the bridle of her horse. She hopped atop it and wheeled around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link furrowed his brow. “I mean, how am I supposed to say ‘no’ when you put it like that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s the neat part,” Ryn said gleefully, drawing up beside him and offering a hand. “You don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link managed an uneasy smile as he took her hand and hopped up behind her in the saddle. They set off at a canter.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The portcullis of the northeastern gate rose and Zelda set her horse into motion, following after the Goron emissary. He hadn’t made it far. She caught up to him before too long and drew to a stop, waving in greeting as she approached.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err—is there a problem, goro?” Kenak turned and asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled and gave a minute shake of her head. “No problem, no.” She cocked her head. “You’re going by yourself? I hadn’t expected you to leave so soon.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak let out a hearty chuckle. “Oh, yeah. I’m not too worried about these puny Blin. Soulsteel or no, I can fend for myself!” He crossed his arms and nodded firmly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She continued to smile, trying not to show what she thought of that notion on the off-chance her opinion would offend the Goron. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe him, just—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You don’t believe me, do you?” Kenak asked fixedly, giving her a harsh gaze.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err—” She cleared her throat. “I mean, it’s just…” A sigh. “Soulsteel is really dangerous, you know? I’m sure you’ve had run-ins with their like before, but things have changed. I’m just worried for your safety, is all. Goron skin, while tough as rock, certainly isn’t harder than steel. You wouldn’t believe the reports we have from the field! Shields, arms, armor? It doesn’t matter, Kenak. Nothing can block those foul weapons of theirs.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gave another laugh at that, hands on hips. “True, true,” he said. “And yeah, I’ve heard some real horror stories in my time here. But I’m not worried—if you heard even <i>half</i> the stories from our tribes…” He grinned, touching a hand to his chin. “They intrude on our lands sometimes too, you know? But we Gorons always stand and fight. In fact, I once held out an assault against two-dozen of those pesky grubbers in a narrow pass while waiting for reinforcements from the Genmarl tribe. When Benlos, Garfok, and the others finally got there, I had ’em down to only four—and not a single scratch on yours truly, goro!” He chuckled again, striking a pose. “It may not look like it, but we Gorons can really move when we need to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly as he recounted his tale of valor. She wasn’t certain what their people were capable of, but she knew from tales that Gorons were formidable folk. She was still worried for him, but she decided not to press.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, as you say,” she replied after a moment. “I suppose you can best judge for yourself the danger. …Though, I hope you don’t mind if I ask you a few more questions before you leave?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh yeah, sure, no problem!” Kenak said, lowering himself to the ground and tucking his legs under his large, rocklike body. “I’m not in a hurry.” He looked down to her expectantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned, looking about. She supposed the field here was a good enough place for conversation, though personally she was thinking a table and chairs with a nice cup of tea.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh well. It made sense he would prefer a natural environment, and it wouldn’t hurt to accommodate him. She dismounted from her horse and took a seat beside him in the grass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I must confess,” she began, “I don’t fully understand what ‘honoring the blood oath’ entails.” She furrowed her brow in thought, recalling what Lensa had dug up. “…Although, I believe it has something to do with my great-grandfather, King Rhosalus Hyrule? I’m told that he was once requested to intercede on the Gorons’ behalf, to avenge a chieftain who died to a lynel. Is that right, or is there more to the story?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak grunted, crossing his arms. “Yep. Simple as that, really. Chief Bhurdon and three of his war band died at the paws of Kiat the Warmonger while out on an expedition in Drenen Valley—and they were only there on Hylian business.” He shifted towards a more serious tone at those last words, then frowned, looking deep in thought. “You’d probably have to ask Chief Rhargon or somegoron on the elder council if you want to know more, but yeah that’s the short of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda puzzled at that. “And to honor the blood oath, I’d have to—what, track down and kill this lynel to avenge the previous chieftain?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak nodded. “Well, not that particular lynel. They don’t live all that long, and Kiat’s likely long dead. But yeah, track down his descendants, defeat them in battle, and recover the Chieftain’s Hammer. Do that, and our peoples’ differences will be good and square.” He grinned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. So it really was that simple. Zelda bit at her lip, considering her next words carefully. She didn’t want to offend the emissary, but she couldn’t help but wonder… “If I may ask, why haven’t the tribes avenged Bhurdon’s death themselves? It’s been… what—eighty, ninety years since he was killed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, no kidding,” the messenger said. “We’ve certainly tried, mind you. But Drenen Valley and the badlands beyond is a big place, and those lynels roam there in packs. Sure, they come knocking every once in a while, and we always band together to send them back home when they do.” He grumbled. “Lynels—they hunt us for sport, you know? Fearsome, troublesome beasts…” A long sigh as he scratched his chin. “Fighting them in the mountains is one thing. On the open plains is another entirely. That’s their home turf, goro! You wouldn’t fight Zora in the water, you don’t fight Gorons in the mountains, and you sure as lava don’t fight lynels on the open plains.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly. “But you want me to. To uphold the oath.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded. “It’s the principle of the matter, yeah? King Rhosalus was a blood-brother to Chief Bhurdon! It was his sworn duty to join in the hunt. But for some reason, he refused.” The mighty Goron shook his head, looking pained. “I just don’t get it, goro! Everything I’ve seen about you Hylians tells me you’re honorable folk. Why not honor your oath? It’s the right thing to do!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uh huh. “Yeah… I can see that.” Zelda said, trying not to let too much trepidation into her voice. She gave a weak laugh. Kenak didn’t return it. He eyed her sternly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took in a sharp breath. “I didn’t get the chance to ask before, but I just wanted to make certain: I can have a champion fulfill the oath in my stead, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded. “Of course!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded in return. Slowly. She’d have to be careful with this one, but surely Link or Izu (or both) with some Sheikah to support them…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She found herself tapping nervously on the ground, and gathered a fistfull of grass to run through her fingers. She’d need to have a strategizing session about how best to approach this mission before she could make any firm commitments. In the meantime…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Kenak, I want to thank you again for coming all this way,” she said to a gracious nod. “I will have to consider how best to proceed, but you have my word it will be done. On a different topic, I was hoping you could tell me some about your people? Specifically, would you be willing to share what you know about magic?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a bit of a stretch, but on the off-chance they had preserved magical knowledge lost to her kingdom…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Kenak said, rubbing his neck. “Sorry, Zelda, but you’re asking the wrong Goron. I can Burn and Pull—most Gorons can. Oh, uh, I think you call those ones… vigorah… vigi…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Invigorate?” Zelda suggested. “Siphon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak nodded enthusiastically. “Yeah, that!” He turned his head, pondering for a long moment. “Yeah, that’s all I got. Sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, I see,” Zelda said, trying not to let too much disappointment through. “What about Blue magics? Green? There are Gorons who can use those too, yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gave another nod. “Yeah, though they’re more rare.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He left it at that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…What about discharging electricity?” Zelda asked, arching an eyebrow. “Isn’t that universal to your people? I’m pretty sure that counts as Green magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, heh,” Kenak replied. “Nah—I get why you might think that, but that’s not magic. That’s just how we are. It’s hard to describe—there’s this energy that builds up inside, you know? And when we need to, we can let it out in a big burst!” He gestured forcefully by slamming one fist into the palm of his other hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s eyes lit up. “Could you show me what that looks like?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, no—sorry,” Kenak amended quickly. “It’s way too dangerous. Kind of all-or-nothing, you know? And it would take me a few days to charge back up before I could do it again. I wouldn’t feel comfortable making my way back without my thunder. Again, sorry. Wish I could.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No worries—I understand,” Zelda said with an amiable smile. “Just curious, is all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A lull in the conversation as she gathered her thoughts. Hmm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you suppose other Gorons on the council might be able to tell me more about magic? Mostly I want to cross reference Goron knowledge with what we know, in hopes of recovering lost arts.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded. “Sure, yeah, I don’t see why not. Oh, hey!” His eyes widened in excitement. “Are you planning to come along too?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled, even as she forcibly quashed her inner adventurer. “I would very much love that, Kenak. I certainly hope to one day.” She glanced mirthlessly over her shoulder back to Castletown. “In times such as these, however, a Queen’s first duty is to her people.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He gave a grunt of general agreement to the sentiment. “Yeah, I can see that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She gazed back out over the open field, letting a fistfull of grass fall back down to the earth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmph. So much for her good mood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sat up straight and crossed her legs, turning her attention back to Kenak with a wistful sigh. “Just a couple more questions, if you don’t mind?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I was hoping you might know something about a location or two?” She paused, considering how much information to reveal, and decided to err on the side of sparsity. “A temple built out of living wood, shaped into a labyrinth? Or a great volcano, surrounded by a ring of islands, somewhere out at sea?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No idea about the first,” Kenak said, “but the second sounds an awful lot like the Eye of Din.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda perked up. “The Eye of Din? Where’s that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A looooong way away from here, far far to the southeast,” Kenak said, gesturing over his head in an arcing motion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She frowned at that. “How far, exactly? If you had to guess?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak rubbed his chin. “No telling, really. A thousand miles at least.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A… thousand…” Zelda half-whispered, feeling her heart sink. Wait… how did he know about a location so far away?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know what you’re thinking, goro,” Kenak said, seeming to read her mind. “How do Gorons swim?” He gave her a beaming smile, then leaned in for a conspiratorial whisper. “The truth is, we don’t. We just hold our breath and walk along the seafloor when we need to. Not that anygoro’s been to the Eye of Din in… hmm… how long has it been?” He set a hand on his chin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda regarded him with a befuddled expression. That wasn’t… She blinked. “Wait, you can hold your breath that long?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm?” Kenak said. “Oh, yeah. We get kind of tired and sluggish after a while, but then this inner calm kicks in and we can just keep going for days. I’ve never pushed my own limits—never really had reason to—but as far as I know we don’t have any.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded as she pondered that. She wanted to get back to the topic of the Lightsworn temple, but her curiosity got the better of her. “What about food? You still have to eat, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak shrugged. “Plenty of rocks down there. Not always the best tasting, but it fills the stomachs.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. She supposed that made sense enough, given the seeming absurdity of eating rocks. Come to think of it, she had always wondered about that… but no, they were getting too far off track. She felt her tailbone ache and shifted her posture slightly. “So, about this Eye of Din—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Oh that’s right, I almost forgot to mention,” Kenak said, cutting in. “No one’s made the journey the long way in ages, as far as I know. But that’s because we have this <i>portal</i> at the heart of Death Mountain that takes you straight there. But uh… actually, even that one’s been busted for a long time. Asdrum used to keep it going, but he and the Chief had a spat a while back, and no one’s heard from him in a while.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda could hardly believe her ears. “<i>Sage Asdrum the Ancient?!</i>” She leaned forward, listening intently.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, yeah, goro?” Kenak gave her a confused look. “There’s only one Asdrum.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grinned from ear to ear. Now she knew for certain they were on to something. “Kenak, do you know where we could find Asdrum? Or if not, is there anyone else who might?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hrmm…” He seemed to consider that for a solid moment. “Can’t say, but yeah I’m pretty sure someone knows something. I could ask around, goro? Though, it’s a long way back home. Took us a week to get here, and I was planning to take it a mite slower and steadier on the way back. And it might be a while longer before anygoro heads back this way.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Would it be okay if I sent another messenger with you?” Zelda ventured. “—And a guard detail, just for good measure. For the messenger’s safety, of course. I’m certain you can handle yourself.” She grinned and gave him a wink.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak chuckled, waving a hand. “Yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem. I suppose I can wait another day or two.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She let out a sigh of relief and rose to her feet. “Wonderful! I won’t keep you waiting long—a day at most. And thank you again, Kenak. I look forward to reestablishing relations between our people.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My pleasure!” Kenak said, also rising. “I will be certain to tell everyone all about you, Queen Zelda. And about Izu the Magnificent, and Arlinkar the Hero, and Lord General Wymar Letholdus, conqueror of the Blin! Such fierce warriors you have. You Hylians sure are interesting people you know? —Oh, and that reminds me: if you’re sending more folks back our way, could you throw in a bard?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A bard?” Zelda asked curiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If that’s not too much to ask?” Kenak shifted nervously from foot to foot. “It’s just been so long since we’ve had any new Hylian songs to sing and dance to. Your people always had the most inspiring music.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. Gorons appreciated Hylian music? That was about the last thing she expected to hear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course,” Zelda said. “I can arrange for that—no problem.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wooo, yeah!” Kenak said, thrusting his fists in the air. “I can’t wait to see the faces of everygoro back home!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ugh. Another three hours down the drain to help settle a dispute between two of the city lords. Apparently the eldest son of House Veres and a daughter of House Larmak had very different ideas about intimacy and marriage than their house lords and ladies would prefer. The whole affair was so thoroughly absurd. Did it really matter whose child it was, when it was born into a loving and influential family of affluent means? “No, Lord Larmak, your house’s honor is not in question.” “Yes, Lady Veres, these events do violate the marriage contract between your houses, but is that really worth destroying a family over, upending a delicate and hard-won political balance, and sabotaging cooperative efforts in times such as these? Can we all just take a step back and appreciate the sanctity of life and this wonderous gift of joy the Goddesses have bestowed upon your households? No? Well then perhaps the Crown can step in to settle the dispute with a disproportionate sum of rupees in the name of maintaining order.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda relaxed into her chair and took a sip of jade tea as she massaged her temples. She would give anything to be free of this mess.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick. What was she doing before that debacle? Ah, right—meeting with Kenak and then deciding who to send as an envoy to the Gorons.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had to admit it was somewhat idealistic, but Naibi of the Sunseekers was her first choice. Her barony was not only ideally situated, but success here would further her ambitions of uniting cultures. It was a good move, and a bold one, but it was not without risks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>How to arrange such a meeting? How to approach it, and how to pitch the mission to Naibi in a way she would accept?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The throne room would have been most proper in another context: Queen Hyrule meeting with a simple baroness to request she go on a diplomatic mission to a foreign power? But that did not sit right with her. Did she not just have a conversation with Naibi a couple weeks prior about exactly that? The last thing she wanted was to reinforce her misgivings about Hylian aristocracy and power structures within the kingdom. She needed Naibi’s <i>cooperation</i>, not merely her compliance, and she would not gain respect from the woman by ordering her around. No, that simply wouldn’t do.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Where else? Her study was often the go-to location for more private, less formal occasions. But in this particular instance, that seemed a mite too casual. Her relationship with Naibi was not the same as that between her and her advisors, or even between her and the Council and its members. She didn’t want to give the wrong appearances. Naibi was not the only one whose sensibilities she risked offending.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The castle gardens? That wasn’t a bad idea. They could go for a walk along the hedge mazes, alone and free from any guards and attendants. The more Zelda considered it, the more she felt that Naibi would appreciate it as well—it was clearly preferable to meeting in a stuffy room or being forced to endure something like a formal dinner. And what’s more, sticking to the inner walls would be safe and without risk. They could…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hrmm…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought nagged at the back of her mind, and she couldn’t ignore it. Was she being too optimistic? Naibi was the kind of woman who read meaning into every action, no matter how minute. She could just imagine catching the woman on a bad day and getting a barb thrown her way to the effect of “what kind of queen fears leaving the safety of her own castle?” Perhaps not so bluntly worded, but the question remained: why the gardens and why not the open air of the market district?</span>
<br><br>
<span>A sigh. Zelda swirled the tea in the bottom of her cup and drank the remainder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why did all this social maneuvering have to be so complicated? She set her face on the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“More tea, your Grace?” Sera.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, thank you,” Zelda said listlessly. She raised and turned her head fractionally. “Say, what do you think of me meeting with the leader of the Sunseekers on a casual walk through the city while pitching her on a diplomatic mission?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sera paused for a moment as she reached for Zelda’s cup. “I… suppose that sounds reasonable enough, Your Grace? The baroness seems like an odd choice for diplomacy, but I’m sure you have your reasons. And the common people cherish any opportunity to meet with their queen.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly. Another sigh. “Thank you, Sera. That’s exactly what I feared.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry about it,” Zelda said. “Just musing on various options.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sera bowed her head and departed, leaving Zelda alone to think.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No, that wouldn’t do either. Going out among the common folk was not an action to be taken lightly or on a whim. Even if the city was still largely depopulated with most of its citizens yet to return, it wasn’t the same for her—the Queen—as it was for even others of high station such as Nyllara, Wymar, or even Taetus. The tiny screaming voice in the back of her mind constantly reminding her of the risk of additional assassination attempts aside, they could all walk among the city and they’d draw attention, sure, but they wouldn’t have everyone and their mother clamoring for their favor, vying to offer their services, or petitioning them to solve all their problems. Well, Taetus might, but if so that was because his ego compelled him to cultivate such a reputation, and use it to his advantage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps in the abstract Zelda could get away with a tour of the city with a moderate retinue to maintain a perimeter, but that didn’t feel right either. Father often did things of that nature, and people wouldn’t bat an eye. But Zelda? That wasn’t her style of rule, and it would raise too many questions. Her relationship to the Crown just wasn’t the same.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What <i>was</i> her style? She thought about that for a long moment, but the best answer she could come up with was “delegating appropriately and often, and bringing inspiration and comfort to her people whenever she was able.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her thoughts went immediately to Lensa. Of course they went to Lensa. Lensa had always been there in matters exactly such as these, and she would love to pick the woman’s mind. But then again—</span>
<br><br>
<span>No. Absolutely not. Just the thought of pushing through all the kodongo dung Lensa would pile up just to get her to seriously consider the Sunseekers—not to mention Taetus and whatever other trifling political nonsense…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Breathe. Let it go. Don’t let it affect you,</i> Zelda told herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was still angry at the countess, and she’d have to deal with that eventually. She was not looking forward to that conversation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urgh. Who else could she rely on? Laylith she trusted well enough, but even she seemed to dislike the Gerudo as much as anyone. That wouldn’t—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know what—no,” Zelda said aloud to no-one in particular, standing up from her chair abruptly. She was so fed up with this garbage. The Sunseekers were Hylian citizens now, the same as everyone. It was time the rest of the kingdom came to understand that fact.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Regret. Immediate and intense. Zelda was so far out of her element as to be a fish out of water.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Winged Shield, while the largest tavern in Castletown and a great idea in the abstract, was an abysmal choice in practice. How was she supposed to have any sort of meaningful conversation here? Everyone and everything was so… <b><i>loud!</i></b></span>
<br><br>
<span>In retrospect, that was painfully obvious and entirely predictable.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She made a round through the venue, greeting everyone present worth noting and making smalltalk where it was demanded of her. She felt awkward having to speak so loudly and so forcefully about such trivialities…</span>
<br><br>
<span>For the occasion, she made it a point to invite Sunseeker dignitaries as well as Hylian in equal measure. Even if there had not been any real fighting during the siege, it was to her favor that the Sunseeker regiment had come to be well-regarded within the southern contingent. Honoring valorous combatants in their struggles against the Blight, regardless of any other factors, was beyond reproach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Eventually she settled at a table by herself on the second balcony. Scanning through the crowd, she spotted Naibi and waved to get her attention. Naibi took note and smiled, breaking away from a seemingly amorous pair she had been flirting with.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt herself blush and took a long drought of her ale. It was not a particularly tasteful beverage—quite the opposite; she hated the stuff. But she didn’t want to appear entirely out of place, and it did give her courage of sorts to see this through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My Queen,” Naibi said with a humble bow as she ascended the steps and approached the table. “How might I be of assistance?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello again, Naibi. Please, have a seat,” Zelda said, gesturing towards the other end of the small table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi did so. Zelda’s mind raced to keep up in the face of her drunken impairment. She blinked and refocused her eyes. How did people function like this? It was beyond her, but everyone else seemed to manage. She took a look at her glass and then set it down. She hadn’t had <i>that</i> much—it was still half-full.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She would be fine. Probably. She just needed to push through it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you perhaps had too much to drink?” Naibi asked with mild concern. “We can speak another time if you prefer. I will not judge.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem,” Zelda said, performatively clearing her throat. “One should not speak to their queen in such a manner, Naibi, Baroness of House Sunseeker!” She tisked and shook her head. “I am quite in command of my faculties, thank you very much.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi at once bowed her head in deference and spoke in an overly serious tone. “Of course, Your Grace. Please forgive me for my social blunders.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stifled a laugh, and Naibi smirked in response. Okay, yeah. She could see the appeal. There was a certain mutuality to this… uhm. Whatever this was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shook her head, trying to keep a hold on her thoughts. It was too easy to get lost in the moment. She… uh…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi looked nervous, and Zelda found herself mirroring her unease. “Is there something on your mind?” she asked, leaning in to hear better over the noise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The baroness shifted, setting one leg over the other and placing a hand on the table. “I had meant to tell you at the soonest opportunity,” she replied. “I suppose that moment would be now. We found out and executed two of Ganondorf’s spies among our number just prior to the siege. We are not certain if there are more—it is unlikely, but it remains a distinct possibility, and one I felt you should be aware of. We remain vigilant, as always, but… well, these are never simple matters.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gave a slow, purposeful nod. Of course there were spies. That made sense. How could there not be spies? How could she possibly have expected anything else, inviting a large group of foreign peoples into her nation? A couple spies, among thousands? That was not surprising in the least! In fact, she should have anticipated it sooner. She tilted her head back and let out a long sigh, then unthinkingly committed to downing the rest of her pint as she tried not to spit it out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yuck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thankfully, she had tools purpose built for this exact situation. The Sheikah could handle this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded once more to herself and wiped her mouth clean. “No worries, Naibi. And thank you for bringing this to my attention. I have just the man for the job. Malg—a Sheikah agent specializing in intelligence and interrogation. I will get him on it immediately. Work with him, and I will assign to him all other resources we have available. Does that assuage your concerns, or…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi bowed her head low. “Again, it brings me great sorrow to deliver this news, my Queen. And yes, thank you—I welcome the assistance, and will of course make every accommodation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded again. She wasn’t entirely satisfied, but she could worry on her own time. Malg was nothing if not a consummate professional. He would do what needed to be done. The reason for this meeting, however…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She strummed her fingers on the table. Hrm. Perhaps she should ease into it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wow. Her ears felt hot, and the room spun a bit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, uhm—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi laughed and cocked her head. “You want to ask something of me, yes? By all means, just say it. I am ever your humble servant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda mentally stumbled. “Oh? Uhm, hmm…” she muttered, gathering her thoughts again. She had planned to ask about Naibi’s experiences thus far as a means to segway into the topic, but—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Or if it is easier for you, we can do it your way,” the baroness said with a shrug. “But really—whatever it is. I am in your debt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda regarded her. It really was that simple, wasn’t it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Naibi, I would like you to go on a diplomatic mission for me,” she said simply. “To Goron lands, back with their envoy, Kenak. There is information about a paragon-hermit I would like you to find out and return to me. His name is Sage Asdrum the Ancient, but they refer to him as simply ‘Asdrum.’ Kenak will fill you in on the details. You need not meet with him yourself, only discover his location. Although, if you get the opportunity…” She leaned a tad closer, and Naibi’s eyes followed her curiously. “Be advised that this is a delicate matter. Kenak is working with us on faith and faith alone. Before I can properly restore relations, I must fulfill a blood-oath, and slay a lynel.” She smirked and leaned back with a huff. “Or have a champion do it for me—it’s all the same to them. At any rate… While you are there, they may regard you with suspicion and mistrust, and a wrong step could invite disaster. But what else is new?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She met Naibi’s eyes and held her gaze. Naibi broke first, glancing away and raising a hand to her chin as she pondered for a long moment. “As I said, if my queen requires this of me, I will do it. I believe I get your reasoning, but I must ask: why me? Surely you have another more suited to this task?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took time to consider her next words carefully. She found there was a certain calmness to her thoughts, and they came easily. The noise in the room even seemed to die down as she spoke.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My aim with the Gorons, as with the Sunseekers, is to heal a divide between cultures spanning decades. Naibi: There is no other for this task. You and you alone are the perfect choice, and sending you sends exactly the right message. I believe you see that? Not just to the Gorons, but to those in our kingdom who would question you as well.” She tapped her chin as another thought came to her. “And besides, given your prime location, it would be most advantageous for the kingdom to have a reputable liaison. Why not begin that work now? And just imagine—if we manage to reopen trade? Well, the Sunseekers stand to benefit a great deal, no? Not to mention, your barony is on the way—not even a day’s digression. I am certain you have people back home you would love to see?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi let out a jovial, merry laugh, waving her hands defensively before wiping away a tear. “Please, Your Grace! I cannot bear another moment of your shrewd and harsh negotiation tactics!” She hung her head low, but it was not enough to hide her smile. “You drive a hard bargain, but I fear I am honor bound to oblige your request.” She glanced up and winked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled warmly in kind. “Thank you, Naibi,” she said. “I am very glad that we are friends.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She started then, and glanced around the tavern. She hadn’t imagined it—the room <i>had</i> gone quiet, all eyes on her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everyone just as quickly found something else to occupy their attention.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A well-earned sigh of relief as Taetus sank into the comfy chair in his office. After a long, hard day, he just needed to finish up some paperwork, and then—</span>
<br><br>
<span>A knock came at the door. Once, twice, thrice. He gently set his head down on his blotter, before taking in a sharp breath, standing, and posing regally alongside the desk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enter.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Queen Zelda?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace! I was not expecting you at this hour,” he said in greeting. “How might I be of service?” Physically, he relaxed into a more deferent and less commanding posture. Mentally, he prepared himself for the worst.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Queen began to speak, but cut herself short, and instead strode the short length from the door to the window. There she stood, peering out onto the castle grounds, rubbing her chin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus waited for an excruciating seventeen seconds before patiently clearing his throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded sharply and refocused her attention. “Chancellor, how would you feel about beginning a combat training regimen in your spare time?” She narrowed her eyes and scrunched up her face, peering down at the floor. “I know it’s… an unorthodox request, but I thought it would be beneficial in more ways than one. Mostly to see if there’s anything the fragment of Power allows you to do now that you otherwise couldn’t, and also so that you might protect yourself in the event you come under attack by enemy agents.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus made a valiant attempt to mask his annoyance, closing his eyes and drawing his lips to a line as he turned his head fractionally and nodded as if to consider.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In <i>his spare time?</i> Really? How to respond to that in a way that would not give offense? And <i>enemy agents??</i> Was there some new risk he was hitherto completely oblivious of, or…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Again, I know it’s a strange request. There’s no immediate danger, and I’m sure you’re quite busy, as are we all.” Zelda paused, and Taetus glanced back at her. “I wouldn’t ask this of you if I didn’t think it was important,” she said. “But I did it too, you know? Well, sort of. A few sessions, here and there. I’m still training, whenever I—” She stopped herself mid-sentence and waggled a hand from side to side. A sigh. “Anyway. I know the idea of being the target of an assassination attempt is terrifying, and if you’re anything like me you’d much rather more capable people do the fighting if it came to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked to him for reassurance. Taetus gave a hesitant nod. That was putting it mildly, yes. “I can see the reasoning,” he said dryly. “Better to not be entirely useless in a scuffle. Buying precious few seconds for someone more competent to save your arse and all that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda giggled and brushed a strand of hair aside, then gestured with a finger. “Oboe. Master-at-arms of the Royal Guard. He’s a great trainer—one of the best. I’ll let him know to expect you. What do you say?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus let out a low groan and let his shoulders slump. “Is this really necessary, Your Grace? Believe it or not, I have had basic fencing training—a number of years ago to be sure, but…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>What could he possibly say to wriggle out of his fate at this juncture? He could already hear her next words: <i>“Just one—</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“…session—that’s all I’m asking,” the Queen finished. “If it weren’t for exploring possibilities with the fragment, I wouldn’t bother you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She did have a point there, and a good one. One fragment of Power had been enough to set King Gaillard a head and shoulders above his peers. In Taetus’ case, though, a modest multiplier on a small number still resulted in a small number. It was basic arithmetic, but he couldn’t say as much.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus often thought about but tried not to dwell on what holding several fragments meant for the Exiled King. …And of course Queen Zelda had considered along the same lines, and intended to have Fi observe him to gather data on that very subject. Why else would she be here?</span>
<br><br>
<span>A sigh of defeat and resignation. “Very well,” he said. “Anything in particular you would like me to focus on?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda smiled. “Magic, mostly, though do work with Oboe and see what he recommends. It might be too late for it, but I would love to get some idea about how your Red affinity might have changed. See if it’s stronger than you remember, or if you can intuitively use other abilities?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus winced. He had for the entirety of his fifty-four years up until this moment kept his paltry Red affinity a secret, but he supposed—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda winked at him. “Don’t worry—outside of us and your trainers, no one else has to know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He met her gaze and held it for a long moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you for that,” he said simply.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank me for what?” Zelda said with a grin, cocking her head. “So, anything for me, or should I leave you to it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The corners of Taetus’ mouth crept slightly upward. “Actually, I had been considering something to boost morale…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“The next outgoing caravan should be… four and a half days, I would think?” Counselor Semmes said, answering Taetus’s query. “We’ve already begun reissuing sales licenses and have reopened bidding for plots, though I don’t expect trade to be back in full swing for another week at least.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nodded as he and the other two men—Counselors Semmes and Rissu—made a round through the city, making plans and preparations for the upcoming surge as Castletown residents returned en masse. The streets were, if not quiet, a great deal less busy than usual. Only about a quarter of the military remained—the majority camped outside the city gates—but between seventy-five to eighty percent of the citizenry had yet to return. The evacuation had been as neat and orderly as could be expected on such short notice, but a chaotic and disorderly ingress in the coming days was inevitable. Already there were caravans coming in by the hour. Practical matters aside—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus came to a halt at the edge of the Larmak district, overlooking the market square. It was rather odd when he thought about it: here he was, <i>the Queen’s Justice</i>, still performing his old duties as Head of the House of Commons in all but name—despite that role falling temporarily to Semmes until the next moot. Semmes was a competent man, sure, but, well… There was a reason Taetus had been unanimously elected to the position for the past twelve years.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The reason being of course a mixture of bribery and brutally shrewd politics. But he also ensured things got done, no matter the situation. Once everything was back to normal, he could rest. But until then?</span>
<br><br>
<span>In addition to handling the seemingly unending crises spawned by the Blight, carrying on his socioeconomic machinations, administering court, overseeing and growing the fledgling information network he established to get ahead of and dissolve any tensions between their people and the Zora—and somehow between all that still finding time for the usual political maneuvering to avoid being dragged into petty games between the noble houses—he was now chiefly responsible for upholding public order throughout the entirety of the kingdom. And what better way to maintain order than—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is everything alright, Chancellor?” Rissu asked. “You seem troubled.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hrm?” Taetus said, glancing to his side at the younger man. “Oh, it’s nothing urgent. I was just wondering if we could save on manpower and resources by sending Champion Izu and his team with the next caravan. The timing doesn’t quite work out though. I believe the Queen wanted him to leave a couple days sooner if he’s to meet up with Champion Arlinkar in Kakariko.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pause as he waited for the men to digest the information. Poised as they were above the market square, he drew glances from curious passersby as well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was Semmes who spoke first. “Pardon, Chancellor?” the aged gentlemen said quietly, stroking his beard. “Is this perhaps the best place to discuss… privileged information?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No worries, my friend,” Taetus replied with a grin, turning slightly to rest an elbow against a stone column. “I’m certain the news will get out eventually. Did you know the Queen intends to restore the Lightsworn order?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That drew gasps and whispers from the slowly growing crowd below. Taetus very carefully paid them no mind. The two counselors looked between each other, befuddled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s quite remarkable,” Semmes said. “Is Champion Izu to become Lightsworn as well, then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That is in fact what the champions are meeting to discuss!” Taetus said mirthfully. This was too fun. The scene was playing out even better than he anticipated. With luck, the rumors would spread of their own accord and he wouldn’t have to take time to arrange for a formal announcement. “We’ve not yet managed to uncover the secrets to Arlinkar’s success, but I am hopeful. Izu—the same as Arlinkar and the Queen before him—has been blessed by the Mother Goddess. Truly, it was by Hylia’s grace that he saved this fair city! Oh, and did you know…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Dodge!”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Absolute Cool!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus’ senses sharpened and the world slowed to a crawl. He dared not move while augmented lest he overswing with his quarterstaff and throw out his back, but the short instant was all he needed to get his opponent’s measure. Taetus eased off his magic, then planted his feet and brought his staff up to parry the blow—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—But couldn’t quite manage it. Oboe’s strike went around his guard and connected with considerable force to his side. Taetus winced and dropped to one knee. Thankfully, his imbued gambision kept him from sustaining any real injuries. It still hurt something fierce to be smacked that hard, though.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Chancellor!” Oboe said with a merry laugh. “You’re supposed to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know, I know,” Taetus said through grit teeth as the master-at-arms extended a glowing green hand. “I just thought that perhaps… mmm, thank you.” Relief. He wiped his brow and stood back up, putting his weight on his staff. This was grueling work, and he was not as spry nor as lively as he was in his youth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your reflexes are there, I’ll grant you that. Not many react as swiftly as you do,” Oboe said thoughtfully. “Still, it’s going to take a good bit of training before you really get it on an instinctual level. Until then, I think you’re best served by sticking to the basics. Getting a parry right while keeping your footing and setting yourself up for a counterattack against a skilled opponent can be quite difficult. Simply not being there, however…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus suppressed a groan. “You know I’ve had fencing training before, yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I was told as much,” Oboe said casually. “And that was what, fifteen years ago, Chancellor? Twenty?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thirty-six, but he wasn’t about to say as much.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry! It’ll come back to you in no time, I’m sure,” Oboe offered. He crossed his arms and raised his chin. “…Am I imagining it, or did you use Invigorate just now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nodded. “Just before you struck, yes. My affinity’s not great—barely there at all, actually—but I have mastered that one skill. Not directly for martial purposes, mind you, but—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Taking in information all at once, yes,” Oboe said, nodding. “That’s an advanced technique. Color me impressed, Chancellor! How are your reserves?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus met the man’s eyes, then cleared his throat and shook his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Understandable. You haven’t had reason to train before now.” Oboe rubbed his chin. “Some meditation exercises would do you good, I think. Thirty minutes to an hour each day, if you can work it into your schedule. I trust you are familiar?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus again shook his head. “Afraid to say I’ve never had formal magic training.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see, I see,” Oboe said. “Well, no matter! You can sit in for a lesson or two with the new recruits. If you’d like, I can make the necessary arrangements?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Queen’s Justice, taking remedial magic lessons beside a bunch of green boys? That simply would not do. Besides, if he was to keep his secret… “If it’s all the same to you, Lieutenant, I’d much rather a private tutor.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oboe gave a hearty laugh at that. “Sure! I get it, Chancellor. And yes, as your instructor that is fine by me. Whatever works best for you.” Then there was that predatory glint in his eye. “Until then, what do you say? One more round?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus had to admit the man was very good at his job. Somehow, despite dreading this training all day, he found himself wanting to continue.</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span>Taetus let out a light hiss through clenched teeth as Nyllara dabbed a warm wet cloth against his bruised shoulder. “That’s it,” he said. “I don’t give a damn what the Queen says. I am never doing this again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm. That’s exactly what you said yesterday, snookums,” his buttercup said. “And the day before that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m serious this time!” Taetus said. “It’s not worth it, and besides—work’s getting away from me. I expected to lose support from Abmont and Beril after the debacle with Marlas, but did you know Lensa managed to negotiate a wardship with House Lotan? Right under our noses!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So I’ve heard,” Nyllara said softly. “What of it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Young Jeremy’s going to apprentice under Sir Mathias for two years, and in exchange House Oda votes with Lotan to block Sifret and Gardnes from inheritance.” Taetus grumbled under his breath as he sat up. “It’s ridiculous. Lotan stands to gain <i>three</i> baronies before the year’s end, and that much more influence at court. And! With their favor, Oda has all the more resources to throw in our way. I swear—it’s always three steps forward and two back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, snookums.” Nyllara eyed him in that sultry, provocative way that made his blood run hot. “But the real question is: what are you going to do about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus grinned as he gazed into her oh-so-lovely eyes. “I can think of a few things.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm.”</span>
