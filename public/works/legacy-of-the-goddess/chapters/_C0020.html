<span>It was so wonderfully nice to be indoors for a change, after travelling and camping out in the desert for so long. A warm fireplace, a cozy bedroom, and a long, hot bath was just what Zelda needed. She was especially looking forward to sleeping in an actual bed tonight, too.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were staying at Dunwich—a small, walled village still half a day’s ride from Castletown. She, Laylith, Cove, Shesan, and a few of her best guards had ridden ahead, while Izu and the Sunseeker caravan continued on with a small military escort to their barony. Zelda reasoned it was safe enough for her here, and Izu agreed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There’s just so much to do!” she mused aloud. Laylith sat next to her at the hearth. The older woman had a way of listening that made Zelda feel at ease in her company. Though Laylith rarely had strong opinions herself, Zelda was eager to get her perspective. It helped to know that, at the very least, her plans met a certain standard of reasonability, and passed muster with the woman who was quickly becoming her most trusted advisor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“First thing’s first: I need to meet with Vestele right away. Apologize in person for getting the Faith caught up in political affairs. Even if it was necessary and she wound up being the best person for the job, I can’t afford to make her an enemy. Especially after what happened at the temple. I want to talk with her as soon as I can, about Fae, and sacrifice, and Demise, and how that all ties in with Morudo Geira and the Gerudo. And maybe the other sages too. Between them all, someone has to know <i>something</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Makes sense,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan really got me thinking, you know? She said my actions at the Temple of Time ‘set Fae loose on the world again.’ As usual, she won’t actually tell me what that means, but I have to wonder. In practical terms. Can we go out and find them now, and convince them to join our side? Vestele said all the records were destroyed, but I still hold out hope that there’s clues hidden in the archives somewhere. And if the Fae really were once a part of Hylia, then maybe—just maybe—they can help us piece together parts of the bigger picture? Or we can just find a way for Fi to eat them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Eat them?” Laylith asked dubiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, if they can’t be reasoned with and are actually evil, we might as well take their power, no? I hate what happened with Niesis, but it did let us mark Link, and that’s been absolutely invaluable.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm,” Laylith said noncommittally.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Come to think of it, how does Shesan know that anyway? Has she made contact with any Fae? Or is she just toying with me again? We don’t even know how much she <i>actually knows</i>, and how much she’s just pretending to know, you know? Maybe she just gives off an air of knowing more than she lets on, I mean. You never know with that woman. I guess Fi would tell me if she was outright lying, but even then…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why don’t you ask her?” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh, really?” Zelda said, feeling a little miffed at the suggestion. “I mean, I guess you have a point, but she never tells me anything unless she thinks I need to know. I suppose I’ll just need to come up with a convincing enough reason for her to not be a stubborn bitch about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith grinned. “I’m sure you’ll think of something.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She isn’t particularly fond of my attempts at magical research, and to be honest, that’s most of the reason I want more power to play with. She tells me I ‘really shouldn’t be playing around with things I don’t understand.’” Zelda rolled her eyes with a huff. “The <i>nerve</i>. Can you believe that? She talks about how we’re all doomed, then has the audacity to throw that in my face? Pfft.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She’s quite the character,” Laylith said. “It’s almost like she’s just as flawed as anyone else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, yes. Sure. I get that. But there’s just so many things we don’t understand! From what Fi tells me, we’re only scratching the surface of what’s possible with Old Magic, and yes, most of it really is that dangerous. All the more reason to test it out on Blin first, no? I’m telling you Laylith, it’s just what we need to get ahead!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith nodded along.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But who am I kidding?” Zelda said with a sigh. “I know what’s waiting for me when I get back: a mountain of paperwork, a bunch of pissed-off nobles, and a long line of petitioners. Ugh! As if I’m ever going to be able to get anything done under those conditions. —No, I’ll just have to make time. Regardless of what gets thrown in my face. I can do it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One step at a time,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know!” Zelda said. “That’s exactly what I’m saying! I have so much to do, but I know I can’t keep running from my duties, either. No matter how hard it is, I have to do it. I have to be the queen my people need me to be! I have a better perspective now. I’ll do better this time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith looked to her skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shrugged. “It just sounds to me like you’re trying awfully hard to convince yourself of something you don’t believe.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned. “You think I’m wrong? You think I’m going to screw it up, don’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith shook her head. “I never said that. I’m just questioning whether you actually believe what you say, or if you’re just saying it and hoping it will become true after the fact.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, what else am I supposed to do? I can’t consign half my kingdom to the Blin. It doesn’t matter what Shesan says—what’s the point of if there’s nothing left in the end? She doesn’t have a stake in this. <i>I do.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re deflecting,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Urgh!” Zelda threw herself back in her chair and took a deep breath. Laylith was right, as usual. “It’s just—I haven’t yet figured out how to deal well with all the responsibility and seriousness being a good ruler requires. On one hand, I’m never sure of myself, and I’m always wondering when I’m going to make the next big mistake. On the other, I know I just need to do my best. Like Lensa says, I have the Council to rely on. Right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ooh, I know,” Zelda said, shifting in her seat. “We should spread the news about Link. It’s going to get out anyway, right? So I think we should take this opportunity to tell his story in the best light. Tell everyone that he’s been blessed by Hylia, and that he’s on the way to recovering the lost ways of the Lightsworn. Liken him to the heroes of old, you know? The common folk already believe I’m Hylia’s champion—is it really a stretch to say that he too has also earned the Goddess’ favor?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hasn’t he?” Laylith asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shrugged. “He certainly believes so. Me? I’m not sure what I think. But I’ve also been thinking about what Vestele told me—if it means giving people hope, does it matter if it’s just a little bit of a lie? Even I have to admit it’s probably what Hylia would have wanted. And more than anything, it would give me some breathing room. Let everyone know that I am in fact doing something meaningful with my time, and not just wandering around in the desert while the kingdom burns around me. —Which reminds me. I am <i>not</i> looking forward to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A knock on the door interrupted her thoughts. Who could that be? Laylith stood and went to check it out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A hooded figure with long brown hair stood on the other side. “I need to speak with the Queen. Alone,” she said. “<i>Now.</i> It’s urgent.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now hold on, Countess,” Laylith said. “What’s this—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Lensa?” Zelda got up from her seat. What was <i>Lensa</i> doing here? “What’s wrong?” Zelda looked her over. She had a wild look in her eye, and was wearing a muddy riding coat. Had she ridden all the way here from Castletown? <i>Alone?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa ignored her, glaring at Laylith. “Well? Didn’t you hear me? I said—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—It’s fine,” Zelda said, heading her off. “Laylith has my full confidence. And if it’s urgent, I’d rather have her around to get her take. Please come in. What’s going on?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa looked to object, but gave in. She entered the room and took off her coat. Laylith closed the door behind her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you not gotten my messages?” Lensa said curtly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda narrowed her eyes. “<i>Messages?</i> No, just the one. About the envoy to the Gorons? Why—did something happen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Countess’ eyes widened. “Oh no—it’s worse than I thought. He’s been intercepting my messages to you too?! Mother Above…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lensa, slow down!” Zelda said. “What’s this about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Taetus!” Lensa said. “I warned you about that man, and you didn’t listen!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do <i>not</i> give me that!” Zelda said angrily, drawing back and pointing an accusatory finger. “I signed your writ before I left! I gave you and the rest of the council power to rein him in!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And I was naive to think that would be enough. That <i>snake</i>! He’s been one step ahead of me the whole time. Zelda, you don’t understand—I’ve never seen anything like it! His followers all but worship the ground he walks on! To suggest that man has ever sinned a day in his life may well as well be a crime! There’s even talk among the people that they want to see him stay in power after the Blight! I haven’t been able to stay ahead of the rumors. And what’s worse—Nyllara supports him at every step! He’s bought off half of the noble houses, and he’s done everything in his power to keep me from working with the others who see his true colors! I <i>knew</i> we should have done more. Now, I fear it’s too late.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gaped at her, an uneasy sickness rising up from her stomach. Lensa was always so composed. Zelda had never seen her so frantic. “…Lensa, I need specifics,” she said, trying to remain calm. “What has he done?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What has he done? <i>What has he done?</i> He may as well have usurped the throne!“—Zelda gasped—”Who knows what he plans to do when you get back?! He’s suspended council meetings ‘out of necessity,’ urging nobles to return to their lands where possible to ‘do their part in reconstruction.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But… the Blin…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, well, the eastern half of the kingdom may be a flaming garbage heap, but there haven’t been any additional attacks west. Would you believe it? He’s even managed to restore some trade with Kakariko! The caravans are less frequent and larger, but care to guess who keeps most of the profits of protecting and escorting them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lensa… what you’re saying doesn’t make any sense,” Zelda said. “I mean, it doesn’t sound all that bad. What’s got you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>—Are you not listening, girl?</i>” Lensa snapped.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grit her teeth and turned her head. The Countess’ admonition irked her, but Zelda kept her words to herself. She gestured for her to continue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“With most of the sitting members of the Council gone, he’s given his lackies nearly free reign over the city. He’s enacted laws giving them unchecked power to arbitrate disputes within their districts, wholly bypassing the city lords! <i>Every</i> expense and <i>every</i> decision goes through <i>him</i>!”—she punctuated each of the words with sharp gestures—“He’s even established his own spy network, and all-but replaced the city guard with sycophants!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head. “…I understand what you’re saying. I do. But listen to yourself! I believe you about what he’s doing, but Taetus is <i>not</i> a traitor to the Crown! He wouldn’t… Nyllara wouldn’t! I know it’s hard to imagine, but maybe he really is just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Zelda, this is <i>Taetus</i> we’re talking about! You can’t trust that man any further than you can throw him! I’m telling you—he’s conspiring with Nyllara to usurp the crown and make himself King!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stepped back, looking the Countess over once more. She understood Lensa’s concerns, but she could also tell she was not thinking very clearly. Had she been drinking, or was she on some other substance? Or was it just that the stress had finally gotten to her? Whatever her cause for alarm—whatever had gotten her so upset—it was clear they were not going to make any headway with her in this state.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, doing her best to give an impression of grave concern. “No, you’re right,” she said after a moment. “I see it now. Thank you for bringing this to me, Lensa. You were right to do so. I need some time alone to think—to plan out my next steps. There’s other rooms here in the inn. Please—get some rest and we’ll continue—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—You naive, fool of a girl!” Lensa spat. “You think you can fool <i>me?!</i> Have you forgotten who <i>taught</i> you?! Spare me your pity. You think I’ve gone mad? I’m telling you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Enough</i>!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No sooner than the words left her mouth, Laylith was at Lensa’s side with a hand on her shoulder. “Get your hands off me!” Lensa said indignantly, trying in futility to bat her away. Zelda gave the signal to stand down, and Laylith let her go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Lensa—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Please</i>, Zelda. See reason! We don’t have time. You must come back with me at once if we’re to have any chance of stopping him!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda drew tall. “Here’s what’s going to happen: I’m going to forget most of this conversation took place, and you’re going to go and get some sleep. That’s an order from your Queen. Go, and we’ll talk again in the morning.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa stared her down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen,” Zelda said, feeling exasperated. “There are things you don’t know. Whatever is happening at the capital, I <i>will</i> get a handle on it. I promise. And I believe you about Taetus. I have no more love for the man than you do, but there’s just too much at stake for us to be at each other’s throats like this. I met with the Lynx. Her name is ‘Shesan,’ by the way, and she’s not Gerudo, or Hylian. She’s… from a place far, far away from here. I think she may be an oracle of sorts. A seer? She’s shown me things you wouldn’t believe—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You, of all people, taken in by the whispers of some foreign witch?!” Lensa half-whispered. “Zelda, I taught you better than this! What’s gotten into you?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s gotten into me?! I’m not the one—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Fool of a girl! Listen to me when I’m—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Lensa, that is enough! I am not a child—I am your Queen! And I do not have the patience for one of your lectures!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you think I’m just going to sit idly by while you sell out your father’s kingdom—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda reared back and struck Lensa with the back of her hand. Lensa recoiled in horror, stumbling back and covering her mouth. Behind them, the door burst open and Cove and two soldiers poured into the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace! What’s—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda held up a hand. They fell silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda… Your Grace… please, forgive me,” Lensa said, wiping blood from her lip. “I’m sorry. You’re right—you’re right! I’m not thinking clearly. I… I don’t know what came over me. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please, let’s put this aside for now. As you say, I’ll get some rest. We can talk again in the morning.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda was fuming, but she kept her temper in check. It took a long while, but eventually the anger subsided. In its place, a deep pain settled over her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took a long while, but she finally understood—finally saw it for what it was. Lensa would never see her as anything more than her father’s child. In Lensa’s mind, <i>she</i> was the one out of line.</span>
<br><br>
<span>How had it come to this?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stood tall. “Lensa, I know you mean well, and I know you only have the kingdom’s best interests at heart. But I need people I can trust. People who aren’t going to undermine me when they disagree with what I’ve decided. You have to understand—if saving this kingdom means turning it over to Taetus, I would do that in a heartbeat. I hope it doesn’t come to that. Truly, I don’t. Yet, whatever his designs, he’s just one man. He can be reasoned with. Bargained with. His fortune is tied to ours. But the powers we face?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked away, up towards the rafters. How much should she say? How much could she trust Lensa with? She decided to be careful with her words, lest they reach the wrong ears and start a panic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I will do what I have to in order to protect this kingdom,” Zelda said, resolute. “And if you can’t understand that, then I can’t have you around.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No! Your Grace, please! I’m telling you—this isn’t me!” Lensa fell before her on both knees. “Please! You know me! I’m not like this! It’s… it’s that witch! It has to be! She put me under her spell! Can’t you see? It’s all a ploy!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gaped at her in disbelief. Laylith caught her eye, and shook her head fractionally.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress</i>, came Fi’s voice, <i>I do not believe Lensa is attempting to deceive you. I can only conclude that she sincerely believes she was under the spell of a witch.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She… what?! Zelda didn’t know if that made it better, or worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>How had it come to this?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>And regardless of her personal feelings, how could she allow this deranged woman to remain at her office?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt cold. When she spoke, the words echoed in her mind, far and distant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Countess Lensa of House Oda, I, Queen Zelda Numenia—”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>“No! Please! No!”</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stopped short, looking down at Lensa in pity. Her old tutor and mentor sobbed openly at her feet. It was a wretched, miserable sight. One Zelda never thought she would see.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Perhaps she was being too hasty in her judgement. Zelda counted it as a blessing that others had not judged her at her worst. Lensa’s own judgement was clearly compromised at the moment, but did she really need to be removed from office? <i>Did it even matter?</i> Maybe a firm rebuke and time spent with her family would be enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Get up,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Get. Up.</i>” Zelda repeated. Lensa did so, slouched over and holding herself like a frightened child. Zelda could barely stand to look at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room was utterly silent, save for Lensa’s occasional sniffle. All present hung on her next words.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can see you’ve had a rough day,” Zelda said casually. “Go and get some sleep. You’ve no doubt important business to take care of at your estate. I expect you to leave and see to those matters at first light.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace,” Lensa said between breaths. “Thank you, Your Grace. I will not trouble you again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned her back as she was ushered away.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Some time later, Zelda heard the door open and shut. Laylith shuffled over and took a seat beside her on the floor. Her gaze stayed fixed to the warm embers of the hearth as she spoke.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Laylith, what do I do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith gently placed a hand on Zelda’s arm. “One step at a time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know it’s hard, but you need to refrain from judgement,” Laylith said. “At least until you’ve heard the full story. You said it yourself: Counselor Taetus has to have his reasons. They may be poor reasons. Selfish reasons. But you and I both know he is not a spiteful man. Nor is he an idiot.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt sick. “It isn’t spite I’m worried about,” she said, “it’s <i>pragmatism</i>. What if he believes me to be a threat to my own kingdom? What if he truly believes I’ll only ever get in the way?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He needs you, Zelda,” Laylith said. “Without you, he has no power. You are the <i>source</i> of his power. His followers might support him to the ends of the world, but if he actually tried to take the Crown—I can’t even believe we’re talking about this! This is <i>insanity</i>. You saw Countess Oda just now. She was raving—nearly out of her mind.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know, I know,” Zelda said. “But I’ve never seen her so upset! She’s really not like that! I don’t understand. Just… why?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who knows?” Laylith said. “Fear makes people do, and say, terrible things. I’ve seen it many, many times. You want my advice? Put what she said to you tonight as far from your mind as you can. Countess Oda has come to her own conclusions, but you must consider matters for yourself. See them with your own eyes. Do you really believe Chancellor Nyllara and half of the noble houses would support a <i>coup</i>? Do you think the Lord General would allow that to happen? Chancellor Adresin?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Maybe?” Zelda said weakly. “I did make Naibi a baroness, and that had to have ruffled some feathers.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith stared at her skeptically. That look of hers always cut straight through to the heart of the matter, and spoke more than mere words ever could. Zelda really needed to learn how she did it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith raised an eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, yes, that’s a stretch,” Zelda admitted. “But then, what was that about Taetus intercepting her letters? Why would he do that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t say. We don’t even know for sure it was him. All the more reason—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Are you seriously suggesting—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I am not <i>suggesting</i> anything,” Laylith said calmly, holding up a finger. “I’m only saying, you are best served by keeping a clear mind, and <i>finding out for yourself</i>. Whatever is going on at the capital, you are not in any danger from Councilor Taetus. As for how the politics play out?” She shook her head. “As you said—there are bigger problems to worry about. Whatever this is, we’ll get through it. One step at a time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” Zelda said, nodding. “No, you’re right.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One step at a time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One step at a time,” Zelda repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She fidgeted with her bracers. <i>Nayru’s wisdom will guide me,</i> she thought to herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Laylith, where’s Shesan?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith cleared her throat. “We’re not sure. I thought we had eyes on her, but she’s not in her room.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That gave her pause. “Does anyone know where she went?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A stableboy said he bumped into her a couple hours ago. Well before Countess Oda got here, if that’s what you’re worried about. He says Shesan went off in the opposite direction. We have no reason to believe they met, or even crossed paths.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What in the name of the Holy Mother is she up to this time?” Zelda asked rhetorically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who knows?” Laylith said. “It’s Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her bracers. Laylith was probably right. Shesan often did things like riding off into the night without telling anyone. It was nothing to be alarmed about. She was probably just being paranoid.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link poked at the smoldering embers of the firepit with a stick. Koja, Grenja, and Ryn sat nearby, finishing their breakfast in a tense silence. Whatever had transpired last night remained unresolved. He looked to each of them in turn, but none of them would meet his eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sighed. He was never any good with this sort of thing, and wasn’t about to try and remedy the situation himself. As far as he was concerned, it wasn’t his business so long as it didn’t interfere with their mission. Beyond that, Link was more than content to leave them to resolve their issues on their own time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Only—they were less than a day away from the mysterious haunted mountain pass, and they had no more idea of how to approach the situation than when they left the Obsidian Spire. Zelda hadn’t been able to find out anything actually useful for them to go on, aside from what Naibi had to say. Link was really hoping one of the Gerudo elders knew more about Ibboso, but it seemed there wasn’t much more to the folklore than just the simple story that everyone knew.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(There hadn’t been anything immediately useful in the manuals they recovered—or rather, a quick pass through by Fi didn’t yield anything pertaining to Ibboso, Stalfos, the redead, Voidspawn, or the transfabrulator. Link couldn’t be sure, but the illustrations in one of them suggested it was a primer on martial techniques. He definitely intended to check that one out in more detail once he had more time.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So…” he began awkwardly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So.” Koja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Any ideas?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nope,” Koja said. “How are we supposed to fight <i>ghosts</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link handled the Stalfos at the spire just fine didn’t he?” Grenja said. “I don’t know about you, but I sure as shit ain’t afraid of no ghosts! What are they gonna do, scream at us? Pfft. We’ll figure something out, right Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh,” Link said, feeling rather uncertain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh, I can’t believe I have to point this out,” Koja said. “Stalfos have <i>bodies</i>. Bones that can be broken and skulls that can be smashed to bits. We’re talking about <i>incorporeal shades of the dead here</i>—I mean, come on! Punching isn’t always the solution.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is most of the time,” Grenja muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, it won’t work this time,” Koja said matter-of-factly. “Think of something else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know, now that you mention it, I think I read in a book once that Stalfos are vulnerable to sunlight.” Grenja scratched his chin. “Maybe that’s the key? Maybe if we just go in during the day, they won’t bother us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You read it in a book.” Koja said dubiously. “Look—Link’s vision didn’t even have Stalfos! Why are we talking about Stalfos?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja shrugged. “Just tryin’ to help, sis. You don’t have to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—It’s like Link said before,” Ryn said, cutting in. “From what Hylia told him in the vision, it doesn’t sound like we’re supposed to actually <i>fight</i> them. Maybe a diplomatic approach would be best? Maybe we just find and speak with Ibboso’s spirit. Figure out why they were cursed to begin with, and then help them to move on. Right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja groaned. “You really think we’re going to just walk in there and convince a bunch of angry spirits to chill out and hand us a triforce fragment? Then move on to whatever afterlife awaits them, after a thousand years of being cursed to wander the desert, never knowing the peace of death?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh,” Ryn said uneasily. “I’m sure we’ll figure it out. Right, Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everyone turned to him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If he was being honest with himself, he had absolutely no idea what to think. Still, he knew he needed to offer solid leadership. They were all looking to him for direction.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Besides, would Hylia really send him out on a task they had no hope of accomplishing? Probably not. They would figure something out for sure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded, giving a thumbs up. Ryn and Grenja nodded in turn. Koja rolled her eyes and tossed a banana peel into the firepit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“By the way,” Link said, taking advantage of the opportunity, since he now had their full attention. “Before we head on, I was thinking we should mark Koja first? Just in case. Ryn and I both have some training, but she’s our most skilled healer by far. Makes sense, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? No, it doesn’t,” Koja said. “What’s the point?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm… like I said, you’re an invaluable member of the team. I just think it would be useful tactically if Fi could restore your magic directly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So?” Koja said testily. “Can’t you just keep using Siphon like you have been? I mean, correct me if I’m wrong, but it’s just as efficient, no? It just takes a little more time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, yeah,” Link said. “But I’d like to have the option, just in case it’s needed in a pinch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If <i>I</i> need more magic in a pinch, the situation is beyond ficked.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, that’s kind of the point,” Link said, beginning to lose patience. Why was she fighting this? Was she just trying to get out of more work? He wasn’t going to say as much, but… “You know, it won’t take anything more on your part, right? Fi just has to do her thing, and we’re good. You won’t even notice a difference.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja sighed. “Look, I’m just trying to save us the hassle, that’s all. Wasn’t there a bunch of fuss just a few days ago about wasting too much Divine Power on the horses? We didn’t use more of it than we needed to then—so why start now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, right now we have a lot more than we usually do,” Link said. “And I appreciate your concern, but I already checked with the Queen. She’s fine with it—she said she’d leave it up to me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, then. Fine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…So you’re okay with it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yes,</i> I said it’s fine,” Koja said. “Need me to do anything?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just uh, one quick question,” Ryn said, cutting in again. “Do we know for certain it won’t take more power to mark more people? That’s a possibility, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm…” Link wasn’t sure. He didn’t think so, but he couldn’t say for certain. “Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi’s chromatic form appeared before them, floating a few feet above the firepit. “I am uncertain, Master,” she said. “It is unlikely; however, I have no reason to rule out the possibility Ryn suggests.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So… what does that mean, exactly?” Link asked. “What do you recommend? Is it safe to go ahead, or should we hold off?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi spun in place as changing hues rippled across her body. “I estimate less than twenty-one point three percent probability that the cost to mark additional individuals will increase as a function of the number currently marked,” she said. “Note that I am unable to refine my models without additional data. As to your query, I do not believe this concern alone merits caution against your decision, if you believe it to be the correct course of action. I do recommend marking additional individuals to increase Divine Power generation; however, protocol demands I leave who and when to your discretion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sounds like it’s up to you, boss,” Koja said. “What do you say?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Twenty-something percent was a bit higher than he’d like. Usually Fi was more certain than that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, could we just use the minimum amount?” Link asked. “Like you did with me. Would that give you a better estimate? Allow you to refine your models?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Master. That is a valid approach.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good. Let’s do that, then.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>With little else to do, Link decided it was best to edge closer to the mountain pass and get an early start the next day. Even with a few hours left before sundown, the team unanimously agreed that venturing into a haunted graveyard at night was a monumentally stupid idea. Best not risk it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Having set up camp up against the cliffside, he and Ryn ventured off to an open area, taking the opportunity to experiment with the stone tablet’s detection ability using the transfabrulator. Link reasoned that since the stories of Ibboso were so old, they were all the more likely to run into more ancient artifacts in the area. Best to be prepared.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Kthump! Vorp! Fuzz.</i> Ryn launched a block into the distance, delighting as it exploded into a shower of green sparks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Having fun?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhm, yes!” Ryn said, sticking out her tongue. “Don’t act like you didn’t play with it too when you first got your hands on it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Link said. He had in fact done just that. “You’ll get used to it. It’s not all that interesting after a while.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Kthump! Vorp! Fuzz.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“I dunno. I’m pretty sure I could amuse myself with it for <i>hours</i> if you let me.” She grinned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link eyed her uncertainly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, okay—that’s the last one,” Ryn said with a dismayed huff. “On to business. What first?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link held up the stone disk, running his fingers over the strange radial design etched onto its surface. “I’m not sure?” he said. “Maybe we should start out slow. Just try and get a baseline—make sure nothing’s changed since we left the temple.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sounds good to me,” Ryn said. “Where should I stand?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A few paces away?” Link judged the distance between them. “Yeah, about there. Fi, can you charge it? Same as you did before. I think it was twenty units’ worth?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, Master” Fi said, materializing overhead. She danced and spun as Link held out the tablet, and chromatic vapors swirled through the air between them. The tablet began to buzz faintly. Holding it in his hands while it was active was a peculiar sensation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” Link said. “Neat.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So should I walk closer now?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, go for it,” Link said. “Slowly—don’t come too close. It’s probably safe, but I’d rather not risk it. No idea what might happen.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn nodded. As she neared, the buzzing grew steadily stronger until it reached a peak about a meter away. Link stepped back and it gradually weakened. At about five meters it was barely noticeable, and around eight it didn’t buzz at all. He took a few steps forward until the disk buzzed faintly again, then flipped it over through various orientations. The buzzing remained constant throughout, regardless of how it was held or which way it faced.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Link said, voicing his thoughts aloud. “So does it work vertically too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seems like it should. Want to try it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded. Ryn crouched down, holding the transfabrulator close to the ground as he approached and held the stone tablet in the air above. The buzzing rose and fell just as expected.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Almost exactly a minute since it was activated, the disk fell still in his hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep—pretty much exactly what we saw at the Temple of Time,” Link noted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Baseline established!” Ryn said. “What next?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scratched his head. “Fi, can you charge it again? Use more power this time—let’s go for a hundred. Maybe something else will happen.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish, Master.” She danced and her magic swirled through the air overhead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The tablet buzzed again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm, that’s odd,” Link said. “Maybe it’s just me, but I think it started buzzing right away this time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed. Master; this is concordant with my observations,” Fi said just as she completed her task. “The device requires a minimum amount of Divine Power to function. I estimate approximately ten units’ worth.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Link said. “So that means it should be active for about nine minutes now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Probably closer to ten,” Ryn corrected.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So… same thing as before?” Ryn suggested.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They went through the motions, but as far as he could tell, nothing changed. The buzzing was the same intensity at the same distances—they even had Fi confirm it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Which was really unfortunate. Link was hoping that charging the disk with more Divine Power would make it more sensitive to objects at a distance. Sadly, that just didn’t seem to be the case.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And just as anticipated, the disk fell still ten minutes in—almost right on cue. Link asked Fi to charge it again two minutes later, except with eleven units this time. Sure enough, it buzzed for exactly six seconds.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm. ’kay,” Ryn said. “So we know exactly how long it’s going to stay charged. What next?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I dunno,” Link said. “Have any ideas?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Use more power?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link raised an eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shrugged. “Fi, is that enough data for you to work with?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative, Master.” A deep violet hue rippled across her skin. “Unfortunately, I am no closer to understanding the device, or the mechanism by which it operates. Presently, I do not expect I will be able to replicate its effects.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh well,” Link said. “Do you think trying with more power will help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncertain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link let out a slow breath, then looked to Ryn. She shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Might as well, I suppose. Fi, charge it again? Keep going until something happens, or until you use up the rest of the budget.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish, Master.” She danced and spun, and her magics swirled about. The tablet buzzed once more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…And a few seconds later, the buzzing stopped as markings on its surface lit up with a soft glow. Fi ceased motion just as it happened, and not a moment later the tablet went back to normal buzzing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, what was that?” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, how much did you use?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One-hundred and eleven units.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Keep going,” Link said eagerly. “Use… ah—I don’t know, five hundred?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Master.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She continued to dance overhead. More of her chromatic vapor seeped into the disk, and the radial etchings lit up again with a faint white light. Link watched in awe as they glowed and faded in a circular pattern, travelling counter-clockwise around the edges.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Buzz</i>. The stream of light flashed red. <i>Buzz</i>. The stream of light flashed blue. <i>Buzz.</i> Red. <i>Buzz</i>. Blue—about six seconds apart between cycles. The red light pointed off into the distance, and the blue light pointed towards Ryn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They exchanged glances.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Quick, before it runs out,” Ryn said, taking a few steps back and around to his side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded, turning his attention back to the lights. The blue flash and accompanying buzz tracked her movement, while the red flash continued to point in the same direction.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Directly towards the haunted mountain pass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link smiled. He felt almost giddy, though he controlled his excitement. There was no telling how long the charge would last—they had to make the most of it before it ran out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any idea why there’s different colors?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who knows?” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned the disk on its side, holding it perpendicular to the ground. No buzzing. He pointed one end towards Ryn, and was met with a <i>buzz</i> accompanied by blue light at the far end after about three seconds. He turned back to the mountain pass. A few seconds later, and the tablet buzzed with a red light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Looks like it’s directional,” Link noted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>That’s so cool</i>,” Ryn said. “It actually works! I wonder what’s out there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. What else? He jogged several paces off to the side, and the red light continued to point in the same direction. Turning it upside down worked about as expected; the lights continued to cycle around, but clockwise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any more ideas, Ryn? I can’t think of anything else to try.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm… not sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The lights faded and the disk went still. As he walked closer, the intensity picked up as he neared Ryn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just normal buzzing again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Doesn’t matter—looks like that’s it,” he said. “Fi, how long did that last?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Approximately eighty-three seconds, Master.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhm, should we be writing all this down?” Ryn asked. “I’m already starting to lose track.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unnecessary,” Fi replied. “I will recall these events in their entirety.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, that’s nice,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pretty useful, yeah,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So… should we test it more?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Depends. Fi? Do you think that would help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative, Master.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…So, do you have any better idea of how it works now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ᏊᏫᏑ’ᎤᏅᏪ ᏮᏨᏫᏪᏡᏅ ᎧᏫᏅᎺᏅᏇᎤᏅᏯ’ ᏇᎺᎤᏫᎲᎹᏅᏨᎺᏫᏅ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᎹᏅᎤᎺᎤᏊ ᏡᎤᎾᏅᎺᎺᏬ ᏍᎤᏯᏫᏈ’ᏯᏫᎧ’ᏫᏭ ᏡᏫᎤᏫᏑᎤᏫᎲ’ᏡᏅᏫᎤᏯ’ ᏑᎺᏫᏡ’ᎤᏅᏫ ᏊᏫᏑ’ᎤᏅᏪ ᏊᏫᏊᎾᎤᎤᏨ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᏪᏅᏮ’ᏡᏨᏨᎲ’ ᏯᏫᏅᏛᏫ ᎣᎾᏡ’ᏬᏫᎤᏅᎾᎾᎧ ᏮᏨᏅᏨᎾ ᏇᎺᏫᏯ’ᎲᏅ ᎣᏅᏮ’ᏪᎤᎧ’ ᎣᏅᏪ’ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᎲᎤᏨᏨᏯᎺᎺᏅ ᏈᎾᎤ~ᏯᏅ ᏪᏨ ᏇᏫᏨᏑᏅᎤᏊ’ᏪᎺ ᎧᏨ ᏈᎤᏊ’ᏊᏨᏪ’ ᎲᏨᎺᏮ’ ᎹᏅᎤᎺᎤᏊ ᏑᏨᏅᏨᏫᎤᏯᏫ ᏯᎺ ᏪᏅᏮ’ᏡᏨᏨᎲ’ ᏮᎤᏪᏫᎤᎧ’ᎤᎤᎾᏯ”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scratched his head. Ryn stared blankly. “…Is that a yes?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncertain.” Fi said simply.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Best just leave this to Zelda,” Link said. “I’d rather wait and see what she says before using up more Divine Power. Fi, can you tell her about all this? —<i>When she’s not busy</i>,” he hastily amended. “Make sure she’s not busy first. Please.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, Master.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn snickered.</span>
<br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Things looked okay within the city. Completely normal, even. One could almost be forgiven for forgetting they were in the middle of a Blight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If there was some great turmoil brewing just under the surface, there were certainly no outward signs of it. The streets were clean, and the people went about their business happily. Many of them even turned to cheer as they passed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda was annoyed that she had to sit in a palanquin as her procession made its way through the city. She’d much rather have this done and over with, but it made sense practically for her people to see their queen returning out in the open and not in fear for her life. She could at least give them that much.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(The Sheikah assured her it was safe, after they had found and rooted out the last of Ganondorf’s spies. She was thankful Link’s plan for leaving the city had worked out as well as it did.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>As her procession neared the castle, Zelda found it difficult to keep her nerves in check. She had sent ahead to meet with Taetus immediately upon her return. Laylith was with her—and several other Sheikah besides. Together, they’d get to the bottom of this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Trumpets hailed her return as the procession came to a halt. Zelda exited the palanquin behind Laylith and gave a courteous wave to the small crowd gathered nearby. Pageantry accomplished, she turned and headed up the stairs, through the courtyard and towards the throne room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith and Cove followed closely behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, four soldiers snapped to arms, then cleared the way to open the main doors. “Soldiers.” They wore crude blue tunics emblazoned with a shield, but without the winged sigil of the Royal Family. One of them was a much older man, one favored his left leg, and the other two were a good two or three years younger than soldiers had any business being.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nearly balked as one of the younger ones addressed her. “Welcome back, Your Grace! The Lord Councilor is waiting for you inside!” he said cheerfully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At arms, soldier!” Cove bellowed from behind. The boy grew pale and stiffened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…<i>The Lord Councilor</i>? Since when had that become a thing?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She really didn’t like this. Was Lensa right? She furtively glanced over to Laylith.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Real soldiers sent off to the front?</i> Laylith suggested telepathically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That must be it. Surely that was all there was to it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda silently prayed to the Goddesses that that was all there was to it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She entered the throne room. As her eyes adjusted, she saw Taetus standing off ahead, just to the side of the throne.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…And who other than <i>Shesan</i> was standing next to him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda <i>seethed</i>. Of course she was behind this. She—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith’s hand caught her shoulder. “Calmly now,” she whispered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s she doing here?” Zelda shot back, probably louder than she should have.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I told you I wanted to meet him for myself,” Shesan said from up ahead. “Is there a problem?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Is there a—</i>” Zelda paced back and forth, clenching and unclenching her fists as she bit at her lip. “—Don’t even think about tempting me right now! I can’t believe you! How long have you been planning this?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan raised an eyebrow. “And what, exactly, are you referring to by ‘this’?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do not toy with me, Shesan!” Zelda yelled. “I know you’re up to something—what is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace…” Taetus said uneasily, looking between them. “I only just met this woman an hour ago.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, he is sincere.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a breath to calm herself, then rounded on Taetus. “<i>Counselor Taetus,</i>” she spat. “Countess Oda came to meet with me last night. Can you explain to me why she was so upset? She ardently believes you are conspiring to overthrow the Crown. <i>Why?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus cleared his throat. “Your Grace, that woman—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Countess Oda.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Countess Oda</i> has never looked favorably upon me. Your Grace. The feeling is somewhat mutual, I’m afraid. As for her latest flight of delusion, who can say? But I assure you, I have no such designs. In view of the Goddesses above I swear to you now that I have—to this very moment—done only as charged.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>He is sincere, Mistress.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“And taken every liberty under the sun with that charge,” Zelda half-muttered, feeling the momentum of her fury all-but leave her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have done only what is necessary, Your Grace,” Taetus said bitterly. “For now, your people are fed and your city is in order. What more would you ask of me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was he… angry? Mother Above, he was angry at her, wasn’t he? And she probably deserved it. Zelda mentally brushed him aside. She could deal with him later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned back to Shesan. “What are you doing here?” she asked, feeling exasperated. “What are you <i>really</i> doing here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What else?” Shesan said. “Naturally, I’m conspiring with this man to overthrow the Crown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started. Taetus turned sharply to face Shesan. From behind, Cove stifled a laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, I believe Shesan is mocking you.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“That isn’t funny,” Zelda said hotly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it’s not,” Shesan said. “And now that we’re done with the theatrics, can we move on to business?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was only an hour past noon, and Zelda was already longing for the day to be over. She turned back to Taetus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What has she told you?” she said listlessly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Enough,” Taetus said grimly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And the fragment of Power?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus held up a hand to show a fragment of gold embedded on a ring around his index finger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned to Shesan, her fury again rising. “I thought we agreed—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Are you even capable of entertaining the thought that I’m not maliciously acting against you and going behind your back at every turn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda closed her eyes and took a calming breath. She was getting really, <i>really</i> tired of this woman.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace—believe it or not, I found it on the floor and picked it up on my way here,” Taetus said. “Mere moments before meeting her, actually. Imagine my surprise to learn what it was.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naturally.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her face. “And what else has she told you, Counselor?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Many things,” Taetus said. “I find her story compelling. And disconcerting. Is it true, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That depends,” Zelda said warily. “What, exactly, has she told you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She showed me… a vision. Of a great serpent, coiled around the world. She says the Goddess Hylia—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yes, it’s true,” Zelda said, not particularly wanting to linger on the subject. “The Blight and Ja’bu—it’s only the beginning. Our world is beset by a great evil, and Hylia isn’t coming to save us again. As you can see, Counselor, we haven’t time for petty squabbles. Whatever you’ve done in my absence—whatever got Lensa so worked up—I don’t care. You’re right! The people are fed and the city is in order. Anything beyond that can wait. Now just so we’re clear: I don’t like you, and I know you don’t care for me either. But where we find ourselves, we don’t have the <i>luxury</i> of…”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, Taetus is suppressing strong emotions. I believe he is withholding information.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>As Fi’s voice sounded in her mind, Zelda noted that Taetus stood up straight and raised his chin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sighed. “Yes? What is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus hesitated. “Nothing, Your Grace. You were saying? We don’t have the luxury of…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, I must reaffirm my previous conclusion. Taetus is almost certainly withholding information he believes to be important.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“For the love of the Mother in the heavens above—I do not have time for this! Taetus, you’re hiding something from me, now what is it? Don’t lie to me, or I will know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus stammered. “Your Grace, it’s not… ah, I’m not sure it’s…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I want you to marry him,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>What.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I want you to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Din’s fiery cunt, woman! I ficking heard you the first time!</i>” Zelda screamed, red-faced. “You can <i>not</i> be serious! I’d sooner claw my eyes out with a—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I didn’t say <i>bed him</i>, I said <i>marry him</i>, you royal idiot!” Shesan yelled over her. “Make him your King Consort! After that, it doesn’t matter if you never see each other again! Leave him to manage your kingdom while you handle more important things. He’s the best man for the job, is he not?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda was speechless. She looked to Taetus, fumbling for words. For his part, he looked directly to the ground, not moving a muscle. Zelda looked back to Laylith pleadingly. Surely… surely…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith spoke up in her defense. “It doesn’t seem to me that there’s any reason for this to be decided right this very moment,” she said. “And further, it seems in poor taste to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, it does not have to be decided right this very moment,” Shesan said, interrupting. “But it is the right decision, and one that’s better made sooner rather than later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The nerve of this woman! Did she even know how this worked? How dare she presume to— Zelda shook her head, getting her bearings. “Why my consort? I could just as soon make a new noble house and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—start a civil war the moment the Blight is declared to be over? No. Besides, that wouldn’t give him any more legitimacy in the eyes of people like Lensa. She alone would—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And how do <i>you</i> know what Lensa would do?” Zelda said suspiciously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan groaned. “You should know by now that I make it a point to know everything I can about—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—It worked for Naibi and the Sunseekers, did it not?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For now. That remains to be seen.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I—<i>what?!</i> I can’t believe you, Shesan! That was <i>your</i> idea! You said—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Look, whatever!” Shesan said, throwing her hands in the air. “If it works, it works! If you have a better idea, go for it! I personally couldn’t care less about the intricacies of your backwards, primitive culture. I just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—My <i>what</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda, can we not?” Shesan said impertinently. “Just—figure it out, okay? I don’t care how. But making him your consort would be beyond reproach. Your father loved him, you hated him, he fixed your city while you were off being Hylia’s champion, and now you love him too. That’s the story you sell! It doesn’t have to be true! He continues to be competent at his job, and you’re freed up to continue your work with me. Everyone wins! Now, tell me I’m wrong, and tell me that you don’t want this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda fumed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She hated to admit it, but Shesan was probably right. The nobles wouldn’t stand for her handing out new titles left and right, regardless of the circumstances. And if Lensa was any indication, the ones Taetus hadn’t managed to tuck into his pocket wouldn’t appreciate him continuing to have nigh unchecked power much longer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What else could she do? Deep down she had to admit that some part of her kind of did want this. Not to marry Taetus of course—even the thought of that made her nauseous. But to have the pressures of ruling the kingdom taken off her back, and with such ease?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Tempting. So tempting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As a common man, he could not be appointed to a higher office—even if one existed and was vacant. Technically it was within her power as Queen to create one, but were she to make a special appointment for him… No, such had never been done in recorded history, as far as she was aware. If anything, that would be worse than simply granting him lands and a title.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Still, she wasn’t even sure marrying him would grant him the legitimacy that Shesan suggested it would. It was completely unheard of for a commoner to wed within the Royal Family. Her own claim to the throne was due to her bloodline, and with a common man she wasn’t even sure if—no. <i>No.</i> She was <i>not</i> going to think about that. She was not… it wasn’t even a necessary part of the fiction Shesan wanted to sell. And if absolutely necessary, she could find some other way to… to…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda doubled over and retched onto the floor of the throne room.</span>
<br><br>
