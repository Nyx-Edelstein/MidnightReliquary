<span>“—I said pick it up!” Ibboso bellowed, dropping into a fighting stance. “You are <i>weak</i>, and <i>I</i> will take your place!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Link yelled. “It doesn’t have to be like this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Choose your next words carefully, boy,” Ibboso spat. “They will be your last.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Palpable tension. Link’s hair stood on end. Even as he calmly and rationally considered how best to diffuse the situation, his mind ran through a dozen imagined combat scenarios.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took a deep breath, gathering his resolve and pushing the fear from his mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Whoever this man was—whatever his designs were—he still held to a code of honor. Thrice he demanded Link to defend himself, yet there he stood, waiting for Link to make the first move. It was a thoroughly Gerudo mindset. How could one prove their own strength and worth if their opponent didn’t fight back? Ibboso didn’t want to fight Link. He wanted to <i>defeat</i> him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wasn’t about to give up that easily.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Have faith, and you will be rewarded.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He licked his dry lips and swallowed hard. He looked down at his sword and shield, then back to Ibboso. “No,” he said, kicking his weapons away. “You may be right. I may not be a hero, but I will do anything in my power to save this world, and I am not your enemy. I didn’t come here to fight you. I came here to <i>help</i>. The Holy Mother herself charged me with this task, and I did not come all this way to betray her trust. You say you’ve waited ages for this opportunity. What’s a few moments more?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso shook his head and laughed. His deep voice resounded throughout the courtyard. Link stood tall. He didn’t like the sound of that laugh, but Ibboso hadn’t attacked him yet. It was a start.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How sad,” Ibboso said. “You think that message was intended for you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link narrowed his eyes. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, boy. The man Hylia sent to ‘save’ me came and went ages ago. You? You’re not fit to walk in his shadow.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pit opened in Link’s stomach. That couldn’t be! Hylia… she…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To your credit, I admire your resolve,” Ibboso said. “I was wrong to doubt your courage. You have my respect. I take no pleasure in what comes next.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A blur of movement. Ibboso charged—far faster than Link could dodge—grabbing him by his tunic. Link struggled, but he was no match for Ibboso’s strength.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not going to fight you!” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Then you will die all the same!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso reared back and flung him against the nearest wall. Link braced himself as he crashed into it, falling to the ground in a heap. Wheezing, he dragged himself to his knees and spat up a mouthful of blood. He ducked as his own sword flew his way. It narrowly missed his head, clanging against the wall behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso neared, closing the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no time to waste. Link drew on his fondest memories, using them as a focus for his magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Teaching himself to use the bow and impressing Uncle with his talent and determination. His feelings of pride and purpose after saving Marren’s Fold. The sound of Zelda’s voice as she sang to him, healing him at the northwest gate.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Straining, he put everything he had into the strongest Soothe he could manage. Like ripples in a pond, the world bent and curled with the pulses of his magic. His vision swam, and he braced himself against the ground. The courtyard washed away, and Ibboso with it. Link found himself standing next to Ryn in front of a dusty sepulcher with an open tomb at its center.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head, getting his bearings. What the…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Ryn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She didn’t answer. Link grabbed her by the shoulder. She turned to face him, eyes white, then fell away into darkness as tendrils of smoke and shadow engulfed the room. Link opened his eyes to see Ibboso standing over him in the courtyard, laughing. He tried another pulse of Soothe, but nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pathetic,” Ibboso said. He grabbed Link with both hands, hoisting him above his head and tossing him over his shoulder. Link hit the ground <i>hard</i>. He winced, arching his back and clutching his side as pain overwhelmed his senses.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Link cried, gritting his teeth and pushing through the pain. “This… isn’t real!” he said between breaths. “You… you’re dead… and I’m not hurt. I’m standing next to Ryn, and we’re both safe.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The aching in his chest and side subsided, and he felt his strength renewed. Link rose to his feet and turned to face Ibboso. The once-king grinned and stepped from the shadows into the light. His flesh rotted and fell away from his bones to reveal two burning eyes set deep in their sockets.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Safe? No, boy. Your life was forfeit the moment you set foot in this place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link circled around, keeping distance between them as Ibboso advanced. “Is that what you want me to believe?” he said. “Well, I don’t buy it! If you could beat me so easily, you wouldn’t have to resort to <i>this</i>.” He gestured around the courtyard. “Seriously, what is this? What are you trying to accomplish, Ibboso? You think I’m weak? I’m stronger than you think. You want to take my place? Well I’m not going to let you! So just stop with your mind games already, and let’s talk!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso stopped. Despite his lack of a face, he still managed to convey a look of pure, seething rage. He snapped his fingers and Ryn rose up from the ground in a pool of shadow, bound and gagged. Ibboso forced her to her knees.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I did not want to do this,” Ibboso said. “I have no desire to see your friends come to harm. But if you won’t fight me… then you will watch them die.” He raised his sword—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t you touch her!” Link yelled, darting forward before he caught himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Or <i>what?</i>” Ibboso spat. “What are you going to do, boy?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link <i>seethed</i>. “Do you have honor, or don’t you? She’s nothing to you! It’s me you want!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just as I thought. More words,” Ibboso said. He brought his sword back and swung.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“NO!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Every ounce of magic in Link’s veins ignited as he closed the distance and met Ibboso’s strike with his shield. </span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stared in disbelief as Ibboso wrenched his sword free from his shoulder. Link’s shield clamored to the ground as his right arm fell limp at his side. He clutched at the gaping wound and staggered backward, then fell to the ground as he took a metal boot to the chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>It’s not real,</i> he thought to himself. <i>It’s just an illusion. It’s all in my head.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>In desperation, he drew on his Blue affinity and projected his sight to the sky above. The ground gave way as he fell through eternity and scried down from the heavens.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His vision resolved just in time to see Ibboso plunge a sword through his chest.</span>
