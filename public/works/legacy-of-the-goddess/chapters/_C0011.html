<span>Zelda studied the woman sitting at the edge of the table across from her. It wasn’t that she didn’t <i>believe</i> Naibi. It was just… something about how she phrased that request felt a little off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Hahahaha!</i>”—Zelda almost jumped as Laylith cut in unexpectedly to her left—“What a superbly useful envoy you are! ‘I don’t have anything <i>meaningful</i> or <i>informative</i> to tell you. No, instead you must come with me across the desert to talk with someone else who is <i>actually useful</i>. Meanwhile, I’ll just sit here and judge you for not knowing things I only pretend to know myself!’ Don’t be so absurd.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Laylith!” Zelda shot back, fumbling for words. “I can hardly believe—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Such words from an old <i>spume</i>,” Naibi spat, making a gesture that was absolutely not befitting polite company. “I am here to speak with the Queen, not her doddering lapdog.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enough!” Zelda shouted as she stood and slammed her hands on the table, desperately trying to rein in the conversation before it escalated further. “Please! This is wholly unnecess—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I am <i>not</i> going to stand by and watch as you make a fool of yourself,” Laylith snapped. “This woman is a charlatan and little more, attempting to con you into believing she knows more than she does. Who knows what she’s playing at?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She <i>what</i>? Zelda looked to Naibi searchingly. The Gerudo woman merely shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh, Sheikah,” Naibi said calmly, seeming to slide out of the tiff as quickly as she entered it. “Never can get anything past your lot.” Zelda watched her intently as she returned to her chair, tracing a finger along the table as she went.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Say what you will, but I do not speak falsely,” she continued. “There <i>is</i> a great evil behind the Exiled King. I have seen firsthand the devastation it has caused. My patron tells me this evil is the very same power that defeated Hylia in ages past. Do I know this for certain? No. But she believes it, and that is enough for me.” She looked back to Zelda. “As I said, only she can tell you more. You should absolutely come and meet with her as soon as possible. I think we all agree that is very important.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda knew she had to respond, but something in Naibi’s words caught her attention. …<i>My patron.</i> Where had she heard that before?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Begging your pardon, Your Eminence,” Link said thoughtfully, “but how could anyone possibly know that? And why would you imply you know more than you do? It doesn’t exactly set the right kind of precedent.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi again shrugged. “What can I say? I was sent here to make contact with your queen. To find out what she knew, and whether she might be more of an ally than an obstacle in what lies ahead. I am also to arrange a meeting, one way or the other. As to why the Lynx believes as she does—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Hold on,” Zelda said, her mind catching up to her. “‘One way or the other?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Naibi nodded, speaking as naturally as if she were asking for tea. “Subterfuge, deception, misdirection? Kidnapping you if I had to. But that should not be necessary, I think.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sputtered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Unbelievable</i>,” Laylith said. “How could you possibly think we would allow Zelda to go with you? Especially after revealing your true intentions? I would sooner <i>die</i> than see her safety compromised.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I would think freely revealing the truth of my determination would be reason for more trust, not less,” Naibi said, frowning as she reclined back into her seat. “Or would you rather me dance around the truth and dress it up in pretty words so as to not offend your delicate Hylian sensibilities?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, <i>that’s</i> a new one,” Laylith scoffed. “Leave it to the Gerudo to think desperation and lack of morals are reasons for trust.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why did everyone and everything always have to be so damned difficult?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Laylith, <i>please</i>,” Zelda said. “Enough bickering. This is <i>not</i> productive.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi leaned forward, arms crossed. “Sheikah,” she said firmly, “I have no desire to see your queen come to harm. She will almost certainly play an important role in whatever is to come. You say you would die to save her? I swear to you now: I will protect her life with my own.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And I don’t buy that for a second,” Laylith said, not missing a beat.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress,</i> came Fi’s voice. <i>I can confirm that Naibi’s words are sincere.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a sigh of relief before she could catch herself. Immediately, all attention was back on her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually, I think she’s telling the truth?” Zelda said cautiously. She met Laylith’s eyes, giving a slight nod.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith groaned, muttering something under her breath. She turned and paced, then stopped and turned back. “Even if she is being honest,” she said, exasperated, “what do you expect to gain from this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started to answer, but had to stop herself. What <i>did</i> she expect to gain? Aside from hoping against hope to find answers to some of the questions that had been gnawing at the back of her mind, she wasn’t sure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good, it is decided then,” Naibi said from across the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is <i>not</i> decided. Not yet,” Zelda said, feeling indignant. “I’m still considering.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you?” Naibi said slyly. “Then you may want to tell <i>him</i> that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hesitantly, Zelda followed Naibi’s gaze to her right. She wasn’t sure what else she was expecting; Link had that look of <i>determination</i> on his face that said: “I am going to do the thing and absolutely nothing is going to stop me, not even the wise and considered counsel of my Queen and her Sheikah retainers.” Zelda knew immediately that even if she could find reason to object, she wouldn’t be able to talk him out of it. Not when they had already come so far.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And if that’s how it was going to be? She wasn’t about to let him go without her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, do we really have a choice?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I suppose we don’t,” Zelda said, resigned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, it is decided!” Naibi said cheerfully. “Now, shall we negotiate before or after we depart?”</span>

    <span><b><u>Zelda’s Journal - Journey to Meet the Lynx’s Envoy</u></b></span>
</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>Day 4, 17th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Two days of searching the Temple’s archives, and there isn’t even a hint of any real tangible information. Nothing at all on the Goddesses increasing magical affinities, or any legends of that sort. I should’ve taken Vestele more seriously when she commented on the sparseness of the Temple’s accounts. I spoke with the other sages, but they had little to add besides what she had already told me. There has to be important knowledge <i>somewhere</i> in all of this, but the sheer volume to work through is absolutely staggering. So much so that I could spend weeks sorting through and indexing all the records here and still barely dent in them. Ugh. I don’t have that kind of time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hyrule doesn’t have that kind of time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I spoke with Sage Kakaro on the history of the artifacts. Mostly hearsay and rumor, and not particularly interesting. The tea he prepared however was amazing—apparently the key to it is adding a variety of local mushrooms to the water, dried and crushed, before steeping the tea leaves. I’ll have to grab some before we go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I had Fi attempt to infuse the other artifacts with Divine Power, but none of them reacted like the tablet. I’ll leave them for the sages to store in the vaults for now. They are priceless relics of history, after all—no sense in trying to lug them around with me on the off chance I stumble upon some way of awakening their secret hidden potential. Even if they do wind up being useful at some point, the vaults are the best place to keep them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>More about the tablet. We did some additional testing, but it ceased vibrating anywhere in the temple after Link activated the egg. Fi believes it is likely to resonate again if brought into proximity with sources of Old Magic, but it must be charged again before use. She also believes the effective radius will scale with the amount of Divine Power used to charge it. Unfortunately, the charge slowly depletes over time, as we have seen. I’ll have to play around with it more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If only ancient magical artifacts came with clear and easily readable instructions…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link is still out of it. He seems to be in good health according to the healers, and his fever broke yesterday. I really hope he comes out of this okay. I wonder what awesome Lightsworn powers he’ll have when he awakens?</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 9, 22nd of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I have become the master of a dozen dangerous insectoid minions! Fear me, enemies of Hyrule, and tremble before my wrath! Muahahaha!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Experimenting with using Fi’s Compel magic on the buzzhoppers was a success. It took up the entirety of the late afternoon (and ate into my training time) but eventually I was able to get them to do simple tasks. I could command them to:</span>
<br><br>
<span>
    <ul>
        <li>Fly around in patterns</li>
        <li>Follow a path of markers laid out ahead of time</li>
        <li>Stay still and ignore everything happening around them</li>
    </ul>
</span>
<br>
<span>Furthermore, they successfully obeyed more complex commands like:</span>
<br><br>
<span>
    <ul>
        <li>“Fly around my hand”</li>
        <li>“Start flying when I raise my hand”</li>
        <li>“Swarm around Link”</li>
        <li>“Swarm around that guy over there” (even while the target moved)</li>
    </ul>
</span>
<br>
<span>However, they were not able to follow other commands such as:</span>
<br><br>
<span>
    <ul>
        <li>“Swarm around the Queen’s Champion”</li>
        <li>“Do something interesting!”</li>
        <li>“Fly fifty feet in that direction”</li>
        <li>“Fly around in a circle, and stop once I raise my hand” (Not good with conditionals or compound logic?)</li>
        <li>“Fly in a circle twice, then stop” (Too complex?)</li>
    </ul>
</span>
<br>
<span>I was able to Compel fifteen buzzhoppers before Fi told me that we reached the limit on Divine Power reserves allocated to the experiment. They returned to normal after the effects wore off, and were not in any way distinguishable from other buzzhoppers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps testing it out on a wider variety of creatures would be a good idea. However, I think I’ll leave it to Link to test on wolfos and kargaroks for now.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 13, 26th of Last Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>We’ve just set out on the road again. Our destination is much closer than I thought it would be; we are heading for the Sunseeker encampment, merely two days’ ride west of Last Bastion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I spoke with High Captain Roesar to get a debrief before leaving. He says that other than being on high alert and considerably more understaffed than normal, things were mostly business as usual. I hope it stays that way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The negotiations with Naibi went far better and smoother than I could have expected. It will still be a tough sell back home, but I’m happy at least with the outcome, and I’m certain Wymar will be thrilled to hear the news. She’s offering 2,505 capable swords wherever they are most needed, in exchange for a small chunk of fertile land for her tribe. Given the circumstances, I don’t think finding an abandoned barony somewhere at the edges of the Floodplains will be much of a problem.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The status of her people within the kingdom remains the most difficult part to sort out. She was wholly uninterested in titles, but naming her as a Baroness would be the necessary minimum for her tribe to be recognized as a landholding entity within the Hylian legal system. For a number of reasons, that might not go over so well with some of the noble families. I suppose they’ll just have to deal with it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi was not particularly keen on the Sunseekers essentially becoming a vassal state of Hyrule, but when I explained what that entailed (paying taxes, keeping to themselves or at least not breaking the law outside of their lands), she gave in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I suppose only time will tell whether this arrangement will wind up being a blessing or a curse…</span>
<br><br>
<span>After speaking with Naibi and the local officers about any threats and dangers we might encounter on the way, I am confident my current entourage will be more than enough to handle what small groups of bandits we might run into. I initially thought Naibi’s request was for me to travel with her alone, but it turns out she is perfectly fine with me bringing everyone else. So that settles that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unfortunately, she had no information on identifying the enemy’s agents or their general operations. I guess we’ll have to tackle that the hard way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We’ve restocked on supplies and obtained appropriate gear for dealing with the winds and heat. I am told that duststorms are common in the area. We’ve also changed out our oxgoats for ones from the fortress that are better suited to the climate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I am now the proud owner of a white cotton headscarf! I like it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To my surprise, I learned from Naibi that the Lynx was in fact not Gerudo. Supposedly she hails from a land far across the sea. I asked if there were any customs or ettiquete I should observe when meeting with her, but she only laughed and told me not to worry. I am most intrigued by this revelation, and am more eager than ever to meet her.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>As it turned out, the desert was much greener than Zelda was expecting. She inquired about this peculiarity at the first opportunity, and was told the vegetation did indeed get much sparser further south, and the land much drier. The Gerudo Wastes to the far south were supposedly a barren hellscape, but here it wasn’t so bad. Sure, there were few trees to be found—except for scraggly short ones here and there—but there was plenty of dense brush, and she even saw a few cacti every now and again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On the contrary, she found the land here to be absolutely <i>beautiful</i>. Breathtaking, rugged, and gorgeous, with rolling hills and craggy cliffs spreading out to the horizon in every direction—bare red earth exposed to the sky. Zelda definitely understood the appeal of living out here. It was hot, sure, but it wasn’t a bad heat, so long as you wore the right clothing and kept your skin shaded. The warmth of the sun on her back actually felt nice and comforting, like sitting next to a campfire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To Zelda’s delight, she even had the opportunity of getting to see an aracha colony up close. Well, close enough to scry at least. Their caravan gave it a respectable berth as they diverted around it. Aracha were small-ish arthropod creatures with adorably terrible-looking pincers for hands and long, spiky tails, that until now she had only ever seen sketches of. They weren’t particularly dangerous unless their hive was threatened, but a swarm of them could easily kill a full-grown oxgoat and strip it to the bone within a matter of hours. They lived together in colonies of thousands in great pillars of compacted dirt that were connected by sprawling underground complexes. Such fascinating creatures.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To her left, Link dozed soundly in the back of a supply cart. Zelda was glad he was managing to get some rest, though she did lament not having her usual conversational partner around. She had grown to enjoy his company in the past week or so. Though he was socially awkward at times and rarely spoke of his own accord, she found him to be surprisingly thoughtful and insightful more often than not. He was even happy to let her yap at him when she needed to de-stress.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scanned ahead and found Naibi towards the front of the caravan. Alone, with her retainers between her and Zelda’s retinue. Hmm. Perhaps this was as good an opportunity as she would get.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gently, she tapped the flanks of her oxgoat and sent it into a trot to catch up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As she neared, Naibi glanced over her shoulder and smiled, waving away the other two women between them. “To what do I owe the pleasure, young queen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She seemed to be in good spirits. That was encouraging.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello again!” Zelda said warmly, returning her smile. “Not much, really. Just enjoying the scenery. I thought maybe we could have a chat alone for a change?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course,” Naibi said, following Zelda’s gaze. “Beautiful, isn’t it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed it is. I’ll have to return some time, after all this has passed.” Zelda pondered to herself. “Naibi, if you don’t mind my asking—why are you so eager to leave? It seems quite nice out here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Gerudo woman shrugged with an exaggerated frown. “Nice, yes, but the weather is not nearly as favorable as it once was. The growing season is shorter with every passing year, and the droughts during the dry season are worse and longer than they have ever been. Feeding and caring for an entire tribe is hard work. The bandits do not make it any easier.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm, I see,” Zelda said, musing. She decided to go straight into the topic which most interested her. </span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you no doubt know, my people are largely ignorant of Gerudo history, at least in more recent years,” she said, somewhat clumsily. “And I am no exception. The Gerudo were once a strong nation and a valued trading partner. Until the raids, that is.” She looked to Naibi with eyebrows raised. “What changed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This is not a pleasant story,” Naibi replied tersely. “I do not believe you wish to hear it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda caught her eye and smiled with a slight shake of her head. “Life is often unpleasant,” she said. “That doesn’t make it any less interesting.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh. If you insist,” Naibi said. “Though do not say I did not warn you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry,” Zelda said with a grin. “You won’t offend this Hylian’s <i>delicate sensibilities</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi had a laugh at that, and Zelda joined her. It felt good. It had been a while since she had a good chuckle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I confess, you are unlike any other Hylian I have met,” Naibi said, looking her over. “What is it about, you Zelda? What makes you different?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Well</i>,” Zelda started. “If all the Hylians you’ve met have been nobles, I can see how you might have gotten that impression,” she offered truthfully. “I promise; we aren’t all prissy and uptight. At least, not all the time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you say so,” Naibi said, smirking. “I suppose I will have to take your word for that.” She turned and placed a hand on her hip. “So, you wish to know of the civil war?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… was not aware there had been a civil war,” Zelda said, somewhat surprised. Though on reflection, she supposed it made sense. What else could disrupt a nation so thoroughly?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But yes, absolutely,” she said, coming back to herself. “The civil war. The Sunseekers. Following the Lynx. Anything you have to share, really. I’m a bit of an historian myself. I would love the opportunity to learn and document everything. All of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say,” Naibi said, turning to look ahead. “Hmm, let me see,”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eagerly took out her notepad.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It began shortly after he returned from his trials—the man you know as the Exiled King—<i>Ganondorf</i>. At first there was peace, but the scale of the havoc wrought in his wake…” Naibi trailed off. Zelda already had questions, but she dared not interrupt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It was <i>staggering</i>,” Naibi said simply. “The tribes have always skirmished from time to time. For a stronger king to assert himself and his claim is <i>right</i> and <i>proper</i>—but there are laws and customs that dictate how this is done. All know this, and every tribe enforces the common law. But the war?” Naibi shook her head. “I had never believed my people capable of such… disunity. Of such savagery.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was a long pause, and when more was not forthcoming, Zelda decided to go ahead with her most burning question.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It always puzzled me, how there are so few males among the Gerudo,” she said. “Are the tales true? Are they really only born once every generation, and ordained by law to become king?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Naibi said, sounding amused. “Something like that. It is not important.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, I believe Naibi’s last statement to be a lie.</i></span>
<br><br />
<span>Well, <i>obviously</i>. Zelda opted not to respond to Fi, and had to bite her tongue otherwise. How could something like that not be important?! She supposed she would find out sooner or later—better not to press more than was welcome. Right now she just wanted to get every detail she could out of the woman.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright then,” she said. “So what of Ganondorf? What did he do that was so terrible? I don’t actually know anything about him aside from his name. Well, and that he apparently is in league with the Blin and has tried to kill me on two occasions. What can you tell me about this once-king?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi shrugged. “As I said, at first there was peace. The kings and their tribes banded together around him. <i>Ganondorf, King Among Kings</i>.” She laughed. “He who defeated the ancient evil that had enslaved our people. He claimed he would unite us into a single kingdom—stronger than any the world had ever seen. How wrong we were.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda couldn’t help herself; her curiosity easily got the better of her. She really wished people would stop talking about these things in riddles and hushed tones. “‘The ancient evil that had enslaved your people?’” she asked. “I don’t suppose this is the same ‘dark god’ I’ve heard tale of elsewhere? Morudo Geira, I believe the name was?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Never</i> speak that name,” Naibi spat, her expression growing dark. Zelda withdrew instinctively, clutching her notepad to her chest. She nodded, eyes wide.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep! No problem. Won’t mention it again,” she said, scribbling a note to herself to follow up later. This had to be <i>very</i> interesting. “My apologies. Truly; I did not know it was such a sensitive subject.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi shrugged. “As you say, you did not know. I am not offended.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hesitantly, Zelda pressed. “You were saying? Ganondorf returned from his trial after defeating this ancient evil?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Naibi said after a time. “And soon after he rose to power, the hardships began. The worst was the Great Drought, which led to famine. And with the famine, infighting and struggle. Despite his decrees and… harsh handling of insurrection, the tribes continued to fight over dwindling resources. Years went by, and the drought continued. Travel between Damaguri and the Mesas became… difficult. Bandits came to dominate the Mesas, which made trade with your kingdom next to impossible. The most desperate among them raided your lands, and you know where that led.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded along.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Others among us sought out other sources of food. We tried voyaging across the Gulf of Nayru, into the Lomei Badlands, but the land there was harsh and unforgiving. The harvests were scarcely better than back home, and even we were no match for the Lynel prides. After the third expedition failed, few others tried to settle there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waited for a natural lull before interrupting. “I am unfamiliar with the geography you reference,” she said. “We don’t have maps charting out past the Mesas. Where are these badlands?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know the Wasteland, yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It stretches far to the south and west, farther than any map,” Naibi said. “But most of the Gerudo live… or lived… in the grasslands of Damaguri. West, beyond the mountains and north of the Wastes, on the shores of the Gulf of Nayru. The Lomei Badlands lie across that gulf.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scribbled out the rough impression of these areas she got from Naibi’s description. “Do you have maps I can study?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure, back at the Highlands.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Eeeeee!</i> Zelda had to fight to contain her enthusiasm. “Thank you, that would be most appreciated!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda finished the sketch and paged back to her notes. “Hmm, sorry to interrupt. You were saying? Failed expeditions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi nodded. “Yes. The Great Drought never ended, and the weather never returned to normal. It seems we were cursed. As the Lynx later showed us, the… <i>dark god</i>, that once held sway over us, also provided for us. And with it gone…”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Aha</i>. Zelda was starting to see the shape of this now. Naibi must have sensed something, as she paused and looked to her questioningly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry. I don’t wish to pry any more than is warranted, and I’m certain there is much more to this tale that I am not seeing,” Zelda said, hedging her words against her next question. “But it doesn’t sound to me like Ganondorf necessarily made the wrong decision there. Just an uninformed one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Perhaps,” Naibi sighed. “I have considered this myself many times. Would I have done the same in his stead? Perhaps, had I not known. Perhaps even if I did. I would take a life of hardship over slavery any day.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded her assent, motioning for Naibi to continue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you guessed, it is not that action which led to his exile. No. As I said, the drought never eased, and the famine only grew worse. Despite this, he ruled with an iron fist. He spoke of unity, and of conquest. He claimed he would lead us to greatness, that we would…”—she looked over to Zelda uneasily—“…find fertile lands elsewhere,” she said. Zelda understood the implication, and did not press. Her people were not at fault for Ganondorf’s machinations.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Time went on, and tensions grew. Many factions sprang up, dissatisfied with his vision. The King Among Kings did not take kindly to such challenges. A prominent member of the Traditionalists was said to have been assassinated by one of his men. The next day, members of the New Dawn—a rival faction to the Traditionalists—dragged that man out into the streets and publically humiliated him before flaying him alive.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shuddered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I told you this was not a pleasant tale,” Naibi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed, it is not,” she said. “Please, continue.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ganondorf ordered his men to slay every member of the New Dawn in retaliation,” Naibi continued. “In the midst of this, a riot broke out, and was brutally put down. Jun Ghassim—one of the kings that had pledged fealty to Ganondorf—his wife was killed in the carnage. He vowed revenge and revolted. Overnight, there was fighting in the streets of Kamorh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At first, Ganondorf rallied and forced Jun Ghassim from the city and into the mountains. But a month later, he returned with two allies: Krinardazel and Kahaidessu. Together… with much bloodshed… the Alliance of Three Kings forced Ganondorf and his loyalists from Damaguri and into exile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And I wish I could say the tale ended there,” Naibi said, growing more intense as she spoke. “But then came the betrayals. Krinardazel challenged Jun Ghassim to a duel over some spat, and wound up killing him. He was accused of murder by Jun Ghassim’s followers, and soon the two factions were at each other’s throats. Kahaidessu decided the timing was ripe to step in and take power for himself. He took Krindardazel prisoner and demanded to be publicly acknowledged as the sole King of the Gerudo. Krinardazel acceded to his demands, but Kahaidessu was found dead in his chambers the very next day. Krinardazel fled, and ever since only anarchy has reigned. Kamorh and Selseib are lost. None with any sense dare return.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda furiously scribbled notes as Naibi recounted the events.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…But as her tale came to a close, Zelda had to admit, she was somewhat dissatisfied. Was that all? She was certainly convinced Ganondorf was a grave threat, and she was absolutely willing to work with the Sunseekers to address that threat. But this? All she saw was a brutal tyrant who lusted for power and dreamed of grandeur. Perhaps there was a malign power behind him, but it hardly seemed like a world-ending threat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know what you are thinking,” Naibi said, seeming to sense Zelda’s doubts. “You are unconvinced.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A bit, yeah,” Zelda confessed. “I’m sorry, I’m just not seeing it. I mean, I know of other tales of great leaders driven to madness. Do you know of Arminel’s Conquest?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi shook her head, looking intrigued. Zelda waved it off. “Eh, the details aren’t important,” she said, not wanting to divert on a lengthy tangent. “Another time, perhaps. But long story short? A great and brilliant general was led astray by a malign power. A Fae, to be precise.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know of Fae,” Naibi said with a curt laugh. “This is not the work of Fae.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And how can you be so sure?” Zelda asked, feeling slightly frustrated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi eyed her. Zelda held her gaze and did not relent, uncertain though she was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I too was doubtful at first,” she said finally, turning away. “We all were, until the Lynx showed us the truth. You will see it for yourself soon enough.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With that, Naibi spurred her horse ahead, leaving Zelda behind to ponder on her own.</span>
<br><br>

<br>
<span>Link threw himself to the ground as a massive club swung through the air. It hit the ground where he had been standing with a sharp <i>crack</i> followed by a resounding <i><b>kthump!</b></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He scrambled to his feet, debris and rubble shifting underfoot as he desperately grabbed for his sword and brought it to guard against his foe. The towering monstrosity <i>roared</i> as it readied its club for another swing. Its face twisted in pure, seething rage, and its burning eyes tore straight through Link’s soul.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It swung again and Link tried to dodge, but his movements were too sluggish. <i>Far</i> too sluggish. The club smashed into his ribs and he was sent reeling in pain. He tried to scream out, but wasn’t able to make a sound. His body twisted and fell into a heap under him. He tried to stand, tried to do <i>anything</i>, but was unable to move. A primal panic rose inside him as the feeling drained out of limbs and his breath grew shallow. He had to… had to…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Ugh. Not this again,</i> he groaned internally.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It often took him a few moments to fully wake up from these kinds of nightmares. In his mind, the monstrous pig-creature laughed over his mangled corpse as he struggled to regain control of his limbs in the waking world.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At last, he managed to twitch his muscles enough to stir himself awake. <i>Ow.</i> His head thumped against something hard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Oh, right. He had closed his eyes to take a quick nap in the back of a supply cart. Slowly, the fog lifted from his mind and he groggily opened his eyes. The oxgoat-pulled wagon creaked and wobbled under him with an echoing <i><b>kthump</b></i>; a wheel likely rolling over a rock in the trail.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much for getting some shut-eye after the training earlier this morning. At Grenja’s suggestion he was working to improve his physique, but he was already regretting it. That man’s regimen was <i>rough</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link pulled back the hood of his newly acquired cloak. It was a simple loose-fitting garment that clasped around his shoulders and billowed out, draping down to just above his ankles. Not particularly fashionable, but it served well enough to keep the sun off his skin and the sand out of his everything. It could also be worn over his warmer wool coat at night, which was a plus. The weather out here could be brutally hot during the day and freezing cold at night, so it was pertinent to prepare for both.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Half-lost in thought, Link caught himself absentmindedly fiddling with his necklace. He slid his hand down the length of chain and pulled out the jagged golden fragment nestled between his clothes. Rolling it between his thumb and forefinger, he examined it with a thoughtful eye as his mind stirred awake.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re supposed to make me lucky, right?” he muttered under his breath. “Think I might be lucky enough to go back to sleep without getting woken up again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><b>kthump!</b></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh. Guess not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Resigned, he sat up and peered out from the cart’s flap, squinting at the harsh daytime sky. Judging by the position of the sun, it had been about three-and-a-half hours. Good enough, he supposed. More than he thought at first.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was times like these he was thankful for having learned a great and mythical skill from his instructor in the early days of his training. As the tradition went, this secret technique was passed down from instructor to cadet in an unbroken chain since time immemorial. That skill being of course, the ability to sleep at almost any time and in almost any place. It had served him quite well during his several years of service; still, it had its limits.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a yawn, he fell back into the cart and looked down at the golden fragment in his palm. He knew he’d almost certainly be dead were it not for its aid. He often boggled at that fact.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A fragment of the <i>Triforce</i> itself. Here, resting in his palm. A piece of the most powerful artifact in existence, and it was his! Passed down by his family throughout the ages, to his uncle and then finally to him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t crazy. It had to be fate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This fragment? The Holy Mother’s intervention? Zelda and Fi, and latest of all, the Lightsworn artifact? It was too much to be pure coincidence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Every day after learning of the initial attack, he prayed to Hylia for an opportunity to make a difference. He had gotten that and more. <i>So, so much more.</i> He had saved over a thousand lives that fateful day. He stared down a Warlord, and had his prayers literally answered—even if it didn’t happen as he would have expected it to. He was knighted, became the Queen’s Champion—who was herself Hylia’s Champion—and was bestowed with the mark of the Holy Mother herself. And merely a <i>single day</i> after that, they stumbled upon a magical artifact that had laid dormant for quite possibly thousands of years, and just so happened to be in the company of the singular entity for which its engraved message was intended, who then followed the instructions to use said artifact in an ancient ritual to cause Link to awaken as a Lightsworn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fate. It had to be. Hylia <i>had</i> to have planned this, somehow, long before she sacrificed herself. Somehow, she knew all of this ahead of time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was he a true Lightsworn yet? He wasn’t sure. But at the same time, he was gifted with a series of visions—mysterious locations that he’d never seen or even heard spoken of before. The Goddesses themselves may as well have written a message in the stars: “Link: Go here!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And one of them? One of them had to be hidden away in the mountains, surrounded by a desert. And where was he presently headed? To meet with the Lynx, who was hidden away in the mountains, surrounded by a desert. The Lynx, who was in turn the one individual who seemed to have any information whatsoever about their enemy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t crazy. There was <i>absolutely no way</i> any sane and rational person could experience these events and not believe there was a guiding hand at work. He was clearly meant to have some important part to play in this story.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Dare he think it? Dare <i>he</i>, the son of a middling merchant-lord, believe himself destined to join the ranks of the heroes of legend? Of surpassing <i>every story he had ever heard told</i>, and facing down the same dark force that had killed Hylia?</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Dear Goddess,</i> he had prayed that fateful day. <i>Holy Mother, guide my blade. I will be your champion.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t sure what his part in all this would be, but it certainly wasn’t a small one, acting as a glorified doormat while someone else sat around and <i>talked</i> all day. He clutched the golden fragment in his hand—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—and nearly fell out of the wagon as it came to an abrupt halt. Wait, what? Why were they stopping? It should be at least a couple hours before it was time to make camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fearing the worst, Link grabbed his sword and hopped down out of the wagon, boots hitting the sandy gravel with a soft thud. He spotted Koja riding past on horseback.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s going on?” he called out. “Why’d we stop?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t know!” she yelled, continuing to ride forward. She turned her head as she passed. “A messenger from Last Bastion is on the way. The Queen ordered us to stop.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was… unexpected. Unexpected, and worrying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link steeled himself, getting ready to deal with some more fate.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Around her, the world spun. She heard the words almost before they were uttered. Somewhere in the back of her mind… some part of her in tune with the fragments… she already knew the words to be true.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>The Zora’s Domain has fallen. There are refugees. More by the hour. They are desperate and in need of aid. They say it is the work of Ja’bu. Your Grace, no one knows what to do! There are so many of them…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It was the dream. The same dream. Except, this time it was no dream. This was simply the last of the pieces clicking into place; a puzzle she had seen many times from many angles, but only just now fully understood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But… no… she had… she had told the Zora about her dreams! And Golvara… Golvara had…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Your Grace</i>!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace! Are you alright?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda snapped to as an arm jostled her out of it. She felt empty, like all the life had been drained from her body. A cold chill crawled up her spine as she looked around. There she stood, facing the messenger from Last Bastion as a crowd gathered around them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And the River Hylia was running backwards.</span>
<br><br>
