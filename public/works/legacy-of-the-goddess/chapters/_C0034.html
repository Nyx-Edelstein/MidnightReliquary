<span>As the team crested the final peak, Izu paused to take in the sight. It was nothing short of breathtaking. Vibrant and green, with swamps, hills, mountains, and forests as far as the eye could see—and with the ancient Lightsworn temple perched atop a lone prominence at the heart of the valley, commanding the entire region. From where he stood, he could even make out the blue ribbon of the River Hylia meandering in the distance—the lifeblood of the kingdom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no doubt about it. This was the place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It had taken three days of wearisome travel to get this far, relying on little but Zelda’s vague notes to guide them. But at last, Ryn had spotted the temple the previous evening while Scrying ahead, and they’d spent the better part of the morning charting their approach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The trek was treacherous—as navigating through uncharted terrain often was—but nothing their oxgoats couldn’t handle. The dense forest and winding streams they encountered on the way in made their progress slow, and the constant threat of fiends kept them on edge. Even if most of the creatures posed little danger to their group—and by the Mother, if Link hadn’t almost taken out that entire pack of wolfos by himself the other day—it was still best to stay vigilant and keep an eye on the sky, just in case.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Squinting, and with a hand to his head to shield his eyes from the sun, Izu got a better look. At each of the four cardinal directions of the square-shaped compound were stairs and ramps that led up to a central courtyard, which was itself surrounded by three tiers of staggered terraces. At each of the four corners, dilapidated ruins stood as silent sentinels: their crumbling, vine-covered walls bearing witness to the passage of time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu felt a sense of awe and wonder well up within. For a moment, it was as if he had been transported to another time and place, lost in the majesty of that which lay before him. The sheer grandeur of these ancient ruins left him feeling small and insignificant—a stark reminder of just how old his world really was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Beside him, Jedal turned to Ryn with a grin, his eyes crinkling with amusement. “You sure we’re in the right place, lass?” he teased. “I mean, where’s the gaping chasm to the abyss?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn rolled her eyes, but a small smile tugged at her lips. “Yeah, well. Unless there’s another ancient temple around here that looks exactly like this one, then yes, we’re in the right place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Link said, rubbing his chin. “This one’s different from the Spire—I’m guessing it’s not just more training grounds. I wonder what it was used for? Had to have been something important. How much of it’s still there do you reckon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja shrugged, casting a critical eye over the crumbling ruins. “Who knows? Hard to tell with all the vines and crumbly bits.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja snorted. “Astute observation as always,” she said, eliciting a chuckle from the group.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu gently nudged his oxgoat forward, interrupting the banter. “No use speculating—we’ll find out soon enough. Let’s keep moving.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aye, Captain,” Jedal replied with a lazy salute as he and the rest of the group fell in.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The woods and brush grew thicker as the team made their way down the mountain and into the valley below. While they avoided the densest growth, a sparse canopy still towered above, blocking out most of the midday sun and casting rippling shadows that danced in the wind. The air around them was warm and damp, carrying with it pungent scents of earth, moss, verdure, and much else that Izu couldn’t place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It would have been relaxing—pleasant, even—if not for the palpable tension he felt on his skin. An eerie calm hung all about them. The quiet rustle of leaves and snapping of twigs beneath their oxgoat’s hooves only punctuated the unnatural silence. Izu proceeded cautiously in front, with Link close behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He calmly glanced over his shoulder towards his teammate. Link nodded in return. He felt it too. Izu’s hand went instinctively to the hilt of his sword. It was only a matter of time before—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn’s voice broke the stillness as she cantered up beside them. “Don’t startle, but we’re being followed,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu steeled himself. “By what? Who?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lizalfos,” Ryn said with a heavy sigh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu closed his eyes and took a calming breath as he felt a chill run down his spine. He knew all too well the dangers these creatures posed. “How many?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just three by my count,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you saying we shouldn’t be concerned?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t think they don’t pose much of a threat to us,” Link said, though a note of uncertainty was evident in his voice. “Well, unless their spawning grounds are nearby. We could be in for a world of trouble if we get too close. They can be extremely aggressive and territorial.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu pinched at his brow. “And I bet the ruins up ahead would make a great defensible location for their spawning grounds.” He sighed. “Mother’s mercy. I’m not sure we’re equipped to deal with a nest without some serious prep work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Link said, resigned. “Pretty much exactly what I was thinking.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Figures,” Ryn muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you check and make sure?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn nodded. She closed her eyes, her head jerking back abruptly and her eyes going white.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shook his head slowly. How she could do that while mounted, he’d never know. “She’s something else,” he whispered to Link as they waited for her to finish.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, tell me about it,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Welp,” Ryn said after a moment, drawing their attention back to her. “Do you want the good news or the bad news?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bad news first,” Link replied without hesitation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Definitely a nest. There’s dozens of them,” Ryn said. “Over a hundred, maybe. Hard to tell.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Damnation,” Izu muttered under his breath. Those were not good odds. “What’s the good news?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They seem to be congregating around the courtyard,” Ryn said. “No idea why, but it might give us an opportunity to approach without putting them on alert.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Izu and Link both said in unison, sharing a look.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link couldn’t shake the sense of unease that settled in his stomach. Were they really about to…? Lizalfos or no, the thought of shedding blood unnecessarily on that scale made him sick.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t think we have much choice,” Izu said, clearly on the same page. “We need to take out the trackers. Can’t risk them alerting the nest.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link winced. “I really don’t like it, Izu. We’re better than this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The older man regarded him with a sympathetic expression. “I’m open to suggestions if you have any. But if we want to explore the temple, I only see this going one way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, I know,” he said in resignation. “Still, I don’t want to limit our options. Maybe we can capture them? Get Fi to help us interrogate them. Who knows what we might learn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That could take hours,” Izu pointed out. “Days.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded. “Yeah, I know. Still, I think we have to try. Are we any better than the enemy if we—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—You don’t have to say it, Link, we get it,” Ryn said, rolling her eyes. “By the Goddesses, if you weren’t so ficking cute,” she muttered.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link felt his cheeks go red, and felt a swell of emotion he wasn’t sure how to process. He hesitated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, so say we capture them,” Izu said. “Then what? What’s the endgame? Correct me if I’m wrong, but Lizalfos aren’t exactly known for their hospitality or diplomacy. You want to try negotiating?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stifled a groan, knowing that Izu had a point. Still, he couldn’t shake the feeling that there had to be a better way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let’s cross that bridge when we get there,” he said, putting off the decision until later. “For now, let’s just focus on capturing them. Obviously it’s going to be harder to take them alive. But there’s enough of us—I think we can manage. How’s that sound?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu stroked his chin thoughtfully for a moment, then nodded begrudgingly. “Alright. I suppose we can do that. Tactics?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link breathed a sigh of relief, his mind immediately shifting modes. Dozens of scenarios played out in his mind, and he let his intuition guide his thoughts.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja and Gazra can rush ahead and cut them off, and be alert for any others that are hidden,” he said. “You, I, and Jedal can each take a target, while Ryn and Kellin use ice bursts to help restrain them if necessary. Don’t worry about conserving magic—Fi can top us up if needed. Koja can watch our backs and keep an eye out for surprises. Ryn, do we know their positions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Six, seven, and three o’clock,” Ryn replied. “About a dozen meters out.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll take six,” Izu said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Three,” Link replied. “Which leaves Jedal with seven.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sounds solid,” Izu said. “Fi, can you let the others know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>After a brief pause, Izu turned to Link and gave him a thumbs up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“On your mark,” Link said, bracing himself and preparing to dismount.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mark!” Izu commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With well-oiled precision, the team scattered and engaged their foes.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>With each beat of his heart, Link felt the rush of Red magic pulsing through his veins. He broke into a sprint, his boots pounding against the earth as he charged forward. Within moments, he was upon his target—a yellow-scaled Lizalfos, a fair bit smaller and weaker than himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Weaker, perhaps, but it was incredibly fast and agile. The Lizalfos froze with wide eyes, taken off guard by Link’s ferocity as he lunged to tackle it to the ground. But even with his magically-augmented reflexes, it was still just a hair faster. Link made contact with a solid grab as the pair of them tumbled to the ground, but the Lizalfos struggled and managed to escape his grip, scrambling to its feet in an attempt to flee. Link rose to pursue, but before it could take two steps, its body was encased in a solid block of ice, much to Link’s relief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One down. His attention immediately shifted towards the others. How were they fairing?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s getting away!” Kellin shouted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mine too!” Izu echoed in response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Got it!” / “On it!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick. Link’s heart raced as he raced back towards his teammates. He—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s down!” Kellin amended.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mine too!” Izu called.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Phew. Close one,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Relief. Link felt most of the tension leave him as he stopped and caught his breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A moment later, Koja tossed him a length of rope from their supplies, and he made his way back to his captive to restrain it.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The Lizalfos hissed and growled as Link approached. He could sense their fear, and he couldn’t help but feel a twinge of empathy. They were simply doing what came naturally to them. But for the sake of the mission, the team couldn’t let them go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link massaged his temples. Mother Above, what had they gotten themselves into?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Examining their prisoners, there didn’t appear to be anything special about them. One had yellow scales, while the other two were brownish-green. They carried wooden spears with iron tips, and were outfitted in hardened hide armor. Little else of interest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, what do you know,” Grenja said sarcastically. “In a turn of events that should come as a surprise to absolutely no one, they aren’t cooperating.” He looked between Link and Izu expectantly. “Time to persuade them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja’s nonchalance made Link’s stomach turn. He didn’t want to resort to that unless it was absolutely…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Hmm…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He felt an itch on his chest and scratched at it, feeling his fingers gravitating towards his necklace. He felt the cool, polished surfaces of the fragments of Courage against his skin, and their rough, jagged edges. Something about those sensations grounded him in the moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” he said, humming, thinking aloud.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And then it hit him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait a second, I want to try something,” he said, motioning for the others to be quiet. How did this go again?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Memories. As usual, they were difficult to call upon in the moment, but he closed his eyes, drew a deep breath, and focused on what he held dear with his fragments in hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>The simple pleasure of riding on Epona with Malon back at the ranch. Lying with Ryn by the campfire as they gazed upon the stars and pondered everything together. The feeling of purpose and determination when Fi answered his prayers at the temple.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>As he opened his eyes, he drew upon his Green affinity to let out a Soothing pulse. Immediately the Lizalfos fell still. The yellow-scaled one blinked, cocked its head, and let out a trill.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head slightly, feeling perplexed. It… <i>what</i>? It was as if he had a connection to it. Like he could understand its feelings.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Fear. Curiosity. Worry. The desire to protect. Distrust. Anger. More fear.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link? What’s wrong?” Ryn asked, setting a hand on his shoulder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nothing,” he said, shaking his head. “Just, uh… I think I might be able to empathetically communicate with them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh my Goddesses! Really?” Koja said, sounding thrilled. “That’s so awesome! You tried to Soothe while focusing through your fragments, didn’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded slowly, still trying to wrap his mind around it. “Yeah. Not sure why. It just felt… right. I had no idea if it would work, but… uhm. I think they’re scared of us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No shit,” Grenja scoffed. “They should be.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja, stand down,” Izu cut in, commanding. “This is important.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Understood.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link cast a quick glance over the party and motioned for them to be calm, then cautiously, slowly, approached the Lizalfos trio, drawing on his magic for another Soothing pulse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The yellow Lizalfos let out another series of trills, and he could feel the mix of emotions that followed. Curiosity, fear, and a current of silent, desperate pleading underneath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re just here to explore,” Link whispered. “I’m not going to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt anyone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The creature didn’t seem to understand him, but the emotions didn’t fade away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Maybe if…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link cautiously reached towards the ropes, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The yellow Lizalfos snapped at him, and the trio began hissing loudly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He backed away and muttered a curse under his breath as he let up on his magic. The first pangs of exhaustion were starting to weigh on him, and he felt himself swaying on his feet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, I need a magic restore” he half-muttered, massaging his forehead and wiping sweat from his brow.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Of course, Master,</i> Fi answered telepathically as her wispy form materialized from the aether to dance above his head, sending trails of chromatic energy flowing into him and filling his reserves.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was better. Link took in a deep breath, feeling renewed, and then focused again. This time, he concentrated on feelings of goodwill and compassion, hoping to reach the Lizalfos simply in a way they could understand. To his relief, the creatures began to calm down again, and he was able to loosen the yellow one’s bindings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Careful,” Izu warned, his voice low and urgent. “We can’t risk it running.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” Link said with a nod, his eyes fixed on the yellow Lizalfos. “Just trust me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I hope you know what you’re doing,” Izu muttered, still clearly uneasy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link chose not to respond. He couldn’t quite explain it, he felt certain he was doing the right thing. As he unwound the last loop, the Lizalfos’ reaction was immediate. It scurried backward, eyeing Link curiously before standing tall and growling in challenge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He held his palms up just below shoulder level, trying to show that he meant no harm. To his relief, the Lizalfos seemed to relax a little, and let out a curious, warbling trill.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Curiosity. Befuddlement.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link could feel the creature’s emotions swirling within him, and he tried to communicate his own feelings in return. Determination. Resolve. Exploration. Duty. He wanted to show the Lizalfos that they were here for a reason—that they weren’t just some random threat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To his dismay, it still seemed hopelessly confused. Its emotions flicked from curiosity to anger and back again. Still, Link refused to give up. He still had a few more ideas to try.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Hey Cap’, I think you should see this,” Ryn said from Izu’s right, drawing his attention away from… whatever it was Link was doing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu turned to face her. “Urgent?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, kind of,” Ryn replied, looking nervous.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu sighed. “Gaz, Grenj, keep an eye on them please. Don’t let any of them escape. It’s the last thing we need,” he said quietly, trying to avoid distracting Link.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You got it, boss,” Gazra said. Grenja nodded and gave a casual salute.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu turned and followed Ryn away from the group, out of earshot. “What’s up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Remember how I said the Lizalfos were congregating in the courtyard?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well… probably best you see for yourself,” she said as she brushed a lock of hair to the side. “Kellin’s got eyes on it now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. That certainly didn’t bode well. What were they up to? Izu scratched his jaw as he glanced over to Kellin—eyes white, head back, Scrying afar.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” he said, sitting down and settling into a comfortable position. “Help keep an eye out back there?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep. On it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu closed his eyes and centered himself as he drew on his magic, bidding the view to mind. He felt a familiar rush as he fell through the sky, followed by a few moments of disorientation as he searched for his target.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thankfully, it was easy to find.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As he looked down on the structure from the heavens, he finally got a good sense of its scale. It was massive—nearly a hundred meters across, he reckoned. And just as Ryn had said before, there were well over a hundred Lizalfos present in the courtyard at the compound’s center.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He focused his sight there and more details came into view. They seemed to be conducting a ritual of some sort, with a shaman-like figure at the center of the courtyard surrounded by acolytes wearing dark robes. The group was separated from the rank and file by several heavily armed brutes, each of them wearing steel armor and carrying steel swords and shields. The crowd appeared to be stomping and chanting in unison—or so he guessed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Then he saw it. They had prisoners—several of them. Three Blin, two Zora, and one Hylian, all tied up on posts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Those poor bastards. Izu’s heart sank. Link was not going to like hearing this news, and he didn’t want to be the one to tell him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He continued watching as the shaman raised his staff, the crowd falling still as if spellbound. Was he giving some sort of speech?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu’s attention was drawn to three acolytes, each holding a glowing gemstone as they approached the shaman. The shaman took the three stones one at a time and placed them into matching recesses on a nearby dias. With a flashy motion, he then inserted his staff into a fourth recess, and the earth beneath them began to tremble.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother, he could feel that from where he was sitting! A few kilometers away, by his best guess.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He kept watching. At first it appeared the ground around the courtyard was sinking, but then he realized it was something else entirely. The entire platform was… lowering?</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Was it a lift?</i> Mother Above.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu’s vision blurred and he fought to keep focus. As the magical Lightsworn lift at the center of the compound slowly disappeared into the darkness, it revealed a gaping pit to the abyss.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Well that answered one question,</i> he thought to himself, still marveling at the impossible spectacle he had just witnessed. What kind of magic could do something on that scale? It was beyond imagining. He wouldn’t have believed it had he not just seen it himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A couple minutes later, the platform rose back into view. Just as he expected, it was devoid of the prisoners. The shaman and his acolytes addressed the crowd once more, but the throng was less organized this time. After handing the gemstones back to the acolytes, the shaman dismissed the crowd, and the mass slowly dispersed throughout the compound.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu felt a rush of energy and another falling sensation as he blinked hard and found himself back in his body, surrounded by the rest of the group.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked glum, and it wasn’t a stretch to imagine why. He glanced back over to their prisoners and saw that the yellow Lizalfos had been tied up again, looking roughed up—likely beaten into submission.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tried to escape?” Izu asked, already knowing the answer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Link muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is what it is,” Link said. “But at least we didn’t have to kill them. We can try again later.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm… Right. About that…” Izu said, relaying what he had just seen while scrying.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>As Izu recounted what he had seen, Ryn and Kellin worked together to sketch out a rough map of the compound, shading in areas that couldn’t be viewed from above.</span>
<br><br>
<span>According to their reconnaissance, the upper terrace to the north had several recessed areas that seemed to function as dens. The lower terrace to the southwest was wide open, covered in vines and other growth, and appeared to be the primary dwelling location of dozens of Lizalfos. The middle terrace to the east was less populated, with a small stream running from a fountain in the north into the mostly-intact building to the south.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link? Any thoughts?” Izu asked. Link realized everyone was staring at him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head abruptly. He had followed the report, but his mind still refused to process it. “Still trying to make sense of what’s going on here,” he said, his voice low.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re sacrificing people to a void monster, that’s what,” Grenja said, his voice filled with a mixture of anger and disgust. “I vote we go and put an end to that shit right now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It doesn’t look good, I’ll admit,” Link said quickly. “But even if that’s the case, I’d still prefer to do this with minimal destruction. Unless they force our hand, we don’t have to wipe out the whole nest just because they’re under the thrall of some cultists.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here here,” Koja chimed in. “I prefer to have less blood on my hands, thanks.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Less work and less risk for us that way too,” Jedal added. “No reason we can’t be smart about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That too,” Koja agreed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t care,” Gazra said with a grunt, crossing his arms and shifting his weight from one foot to the other.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whatever we do, we should decide soon,” Kellin said. “There’s likely to be more of them out here, and we still have the element of surprise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Agreed,” Ryn said, crossing her arms over her chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu turned to Link, his gaze intense. “Your call,” he said. “How do you want to handle it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gazed over to the Lizalfos trio as he pondered. The green-brown ones seemed particularly wary and fearful, unwilling to engage in any attempts at communication. The yellow one on the other hand, was still unconscious from the rough treatment she had received when attempting to run. He had made some progress with her, but it was a safe bet that they’d only get a hostile response when she came to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link groaned aloud and pressed a fist into the dirt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, so here’s the deal. I still want to try a diplomatic approach,” he said, looking over the group. “We have Fi, and she can learn their language. The only thing standing in our way is a bit of time, and getting them to talk. Once we can effectively communicate, we can figure out what they want and maybe broker a deal. We don’t have to trust them, or negotiate anything complicated—we just have to convince them that we aren’t a threat so we can get more information about the temple here and plan our next steps. In the meantime, we can run reconnaissance and search for alternate entrances just in case that doesn’t pan out.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja raised an eyebrow. “What, you mean like secret passages?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Link said with a nod. “A place like this? It’s bound to have at least one. I’ve never come across a fortified settlement without some kind of hidden escape route.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, maybe,” Koja replied. Shrugs all around as the team exchanged looks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright then,” Izu said, taking charge. “Let’s pack up and head back towards the mountains. Kellin, Ryn, any suggestions on where to set up camp?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There’s a nice overlook about three kilometers south-southwest,” Kellin said. “A stream nearby too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sounds good,” Izu said. “Lead the way, please. Gaz, Grenj, load up the prisoners. Let’s get moving.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The group murmured in agreement, preparing to depart. Link still felt uneasy. He was pretty sure Izu was only humoring him out of respect. Still, he felt a glimmer of hope. Seeking a path without any senseless violence would be difficult, but he was willing to try.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Worst case, they could always fall back to siege tactics—maybe even recruit help from Hylia’s Watch if need be. He didn’t want to ponder that at present, but consciously acknowledging the strategy helped to fortify his resolve.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As they mounted their oxgoats, a thought occurred to him. He turned to Ryn, curious. “Hey Ryn, you mentioned that there was a fountain and a stream in the middle terrace. Can you tell me more about that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn shrugged. “It was less of a ‘fountain’ and more of a natural spring. There were some ruins nearby, but not much more than a pile of weathered stone, really. Why do you ask?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There was a basin of water atop a fountain at the end of the gauntlet in the Spire,” Link explained. “Drinking from it is what gave me the vision of Hylia and increased my endurance, I’m pretty sure. I was wondering if the fountain you saw had any relation to that. If so, it could be really important.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn considered, then shook her head. “No, I’m pretty sure not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, okay,” Link said, feeling disappointed. So much for that idea.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After an hour’s trek up the mountain, the team arrived at their destination and began setting up camp. Although the view wasn’t as awe-inspiring as the one during their ascent, it still afforded them a decent vantage point to survey the area. They wouldn’t be caught off guard here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>While the rest of the group busied themselves with setup, Link called forth Fi, getting her assistance in replenishing their depleted magic reserves, while also inquiring about what would be necessary for her to learn the Lizalfos language. Izu overheard her responding that she could make some headway by simply observing them if they could be prodded into speaking to each other, though that direct communication would be faster and more effective. Made sense.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As Gazra strung the three Lizalfos captives up to poles staked into the ground, Izu did a final survey of the area and checked with the others to ensure that there were no pressing concerns. Satisfied that everything was in order, he walked over to Link and stood shoulder-to-shoulder as they both studied their prisoners.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So. What are you thinking?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link let out a pained sigh as he rubbed his neck. “Not sure. They just won’t talk. Too afraid of us, probably? I tried giving them food to calm them down, but they don’t seem to like much of anything we eat.” He glanced towards Izu briefly. “Honestly, I’m not sure what I was expecting with us keeping them tied up like this. But it’s not like we have any other options.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No kidding, Link. And yet…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu stroked his chin thoughtfully. “Maybe we should move them further away from camp? Give them some space and time to cool off and think. Meanwhile, you and Ryn can try to find some local food. Fish, insects, fruit, nuts, mushrooms? There’s got to be something out here they eat. I’ll keep watch nearby with Fi just in case they start chittering while you’re gone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded in agreement. “Sure, that’s worth a shot. I’ll see what we can scrounge up.” He hesitated. “I’m not the greatest fisherman though. And I don’t think Ryn is either.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No problem—leave that to Jedal,” Izu said, waving a hand. “Send him to get some fish, and Grenja to watch his back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, yeah. Good idea,” Link replied. “Oh, and we should probably take the stone tablet with us too. We haven’t tried using it yet, and it’s been on my mind. Might as well, given our proximity to the temple.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good thinking,” Izu said. He furrowed his brow. “But correct me if I’m wrong—that needs to be charged by Fi first before it can be used. If you want—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Right, right,” Link said. “Sorry, I almost forgot.” He scratched his head and let out a sigh. “Yeah, it shouldn’t take long. We can charge it and test it before we leave and see what happens. Then she’s all yours.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sounds like a plan,” Izu said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded to him and headed off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu sighed, stretched, then found a comfortable spot to sit and begin whittling. He could already tell it was going to be one of those days.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After digging out the stone tablet from his pack, Link called on Fi to charge it enough to activate long-range mode. As the face of the device lit up, they discovered that there were four pings, three of which were in the direction of the temple. Red, yellow, and purple, while the fourth pinged blue, back in the direction of Izu.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The blue one is clearly the transfabrulator,” Koja said. “But I don’t think we’ve seen the other colors before.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’ve seen red before,” Ryn corrected her. “I’m pretty sure it means Fae. I think it pinged Lucia back at the haunted pass.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh great, just what we need,” Koja groaned. “More mind-magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What do you think the yellow and purple ones are?” Link asked, putting aside the thought of another run-in with Fae for now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Isn’t it obvious?” Grenja said from across the camp, just as he and Jedal were leaving. “Lightsworn and Voidspawn!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” Koja said thoughtfully. “You know, maybe for once it is actually that simple.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here’s to hoping,” Ryn said, a fluid blend of trepidation and optimism in her voice.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Their trek through the forest was not without incident. They had a minor scuffle with a wild grubber, but came away victorious and with a mixed bag of items. Among them were spiky yellow fruit that looked tantalizing, but had a stench so awful it made Link’s eyes water. Besides that, the pair of them collected a small basket of various nuts along with a few mushrooms they were pretty sure weren’t poisonous.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Back at camp, the Lizalfos practically begged for the fish to be brought to them raw rather than cooked. And to their surprise, the reptilian creatures seemed to love the stinky fruit as well. They chatted excitedly amongst themselves while feasting on the small bounty, but didn’t touch the nuts or mushrooms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Izu had also tried carving a statue in the likeness of a Lizalfos and gifting it to them, but they seemed to be deeply offended by the attempt.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unfortunately, after the meal the Lizalfos quickly lost interest in conversation, and went back to being uncooperative. Link tried to talk with them directly again, but to no avail. They also didn’t seem like they cared for more food at present.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fortunately however, it was enough for Fi to make some headway in her translation attempts. Intriguingly, she informed them that the Lizalfos language had a grammar that bore a striking similarity to the Zoran language, but the lexicon was entirely different. She still needed to observe a lot more communication before she could effectively translate, though.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Not quite as much as he was hoping for, but it was progress.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Another hour of fruitless attempts. Eventually Grenja wandered over, asking how their efforts were progressing. Link gave him a quick rundown of all the tactics they had tried so far, to no avail.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja shook his head and tisked. “You’re going about this all wrong, my man!” he said. “If you want them to talk, you need to give them something to talk about.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked at him with a mixture of curiosity, confusion, and wary intrigue. Dare he ask?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It doesn’t really matter what they’re talking about, right?” he continued. “You just need to get them chatting for a while. Loosen their lips.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded slowly, still not entirely sure where this was going. He wasn’t about to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And I don’t mean torture,” Grenja said, as if reading his mind. He folded his arms. “So here’s what you do: split them up so that they’re all separated and have to catch each other up on what happens. Then—like I said—give them something to talk about. Make one of them watch while you spar with Gaz, or scare another one with the transfabrulator whooshing by its head. Or go full psychological on ’em, dance around them in a circle while chanting—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Err, yeah, I think I get it,” Link said. “Thanks, Grenja. That’s actually a really good idea.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s what I’m here for.” Grenja gave him a wink and friendly slap on the back. “You got this. Need help moving them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’d be great, yeah,” Link said. “Just uh—try not to rough them up too much this time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure. Whatever you say, boss.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link brainstormed with the rest of the team to come up with a plan, taking Grenja’s advice to heart. They separated the Lizalfos so that they were all isolated, out of line of sight and earshot of one another. Then, they began presenting them with unique experiences and novel stimuli in hopes of sparking conversation. Nothing quite as drastic as Grenja had suggested. Throwing feathers around and drawing patterns in the dirt. Dancing, music, song, using Fi to make extravagant displays—that kind of thing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>After a short while, they brought the Lizalfos back together again—and to Link’s delight, the plan worked perfectly. The creatures chattered amongst themselves for a solid hour, giving Fi ample data to analyze.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Confident Fi had all she needed, Link left them to Izu while he and the rest of the team prepared the camp for dusk.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Lizalfos!” Ryn’s voice rang out in the dead of night, sending everyone into high alert. “Scouting party. Four—no, five!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link bolted from his tent, grabbing his sword and bow on the way out. As he emerged, he caught Izu’s eye a few paces away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re getting away!” Ryn yelled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused for the briefest of instants, tactically weighing their options.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hunt them down!” Izu commanded. “We can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Belay that! Stand down!” Link boomed over Izu before he had a clear idea of what he was saying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja skidded to a halt, and Gazra stopped mid-transformation, reverting back to his Hylian form. Kellin, perched like a bird of prey on the cliff’s edge, whipped her head around to observe the commotion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu glared at Link, crossing his arms and setting his jaw. “Link? They’re going to know we’re here now,” he stated calmly. Though his words were indirect, the meaning was unmistakable.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Explain yourself. Now.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s nerves nearly got the better of him as he withered under the harshness of Izu’s commanding gaze. He felt the eyes of both teams weighing on him. He knew of course that he and Izu were co-equal in rank, but that didn’t stop the soldier in him from reflexively submitting to the authority of command.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took a deep breath and centered himself before standing tall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” he said, still not feeling terribly confident in his decision, but proceeding anyway. “But it’s a risk we have to take. We’ve worked so hard for the possibility of a peaceful resolution, and we’re so close! But if we resort to violence now, all hope of that goes out the window.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu’s expression softened and he let out a small sigh. He turned away, shaking his head and muttering something under his breath.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What the heck?” Koja interjected. “How did they find us anyway?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link rubbed his neck, sharing a look with Ryn. “We had a run-in with a wild grubber while gathering food,” she said. “And we weren’t careful to cover our tracks. They probably found the carcass.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yikes,” Grenja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, that’d do it,” Jedal said with a slow nod, chiming in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja groaned and slumped down onto the ground near the fire pit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So what now?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link glanced back at Izu, who let out another sigh and hung his head. “Your call, Link,” he said, sounding resigned. “What next?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He likely didn’t mean anything by it, but the gravity of those words stung. Again, the implication was clear: “You got us into this mess, now you get us out of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link put it from his mind. He weighed their options, considering their next move. The Lizalfos were known to be territorial and aggressive, but they were quite a distance away from their nest and didn’t pose an immediate threat. Still, he couldn’t rule out the possibility of them risking a confrontation to save their prisoners. He wouldn’t bet on it, but they had just sent out a scouting party…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked over at the three captives, noting the female’s protective tendencies towards the others. Could the larger group be willing to risk an ambush to save them? It was a possibility that he couldn’t ignore.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I honestly don’t know what to expect,” he admitted. “But we shouldn’t make it easy for them if they try to attack us. I think we should move camp.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin arched an eyebrow, voicing her doubts. “Through the forest and swamps in the dead of night?” she asked skeptically. “And what makes you think they won’t find us wherever we go? With our oxgoats, we couldn’t hide our tracks if we wanted to.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She makes a good point,” Izu said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ugh. He hadn’t considered that. Most of the nastier fiends were nocturnal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think it’s best if we retreat a bit further into the mountains for now,” Link said, trying to show more confidence than he felt. “I doubt they’ll chase us that far, especially if it looks to them like we’re leaving.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced around at the team. Izu seemed to ponder it for a tense moment, then gave a nod of assent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja groaned again and began throwing dirt onto the fire. The others set to work packing up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“One more thing,” Link says. “I want to talk with the prisoners, and set one free. The female, definitely—she’s been the most cooperative. We can send her back to the others with a message as a show of good faith.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You think that will work?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “Unless anyone has any better ideas?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No one spoke up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, well,” Izu said, turning and grabbing the tarp of his tent. “Let’s get to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>As he approached the prisoners with a bag of food in hand, Link called on Fi, and her chromatic form materialized from the aether just above and in front of the trio.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, tell her that I’m going to release her, but I want to talk with her first before she goes anywhere,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly, master,” Fi said. She then turned and spoke to the Lizalfos in a series of chirps, growls, and trills.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A short pause as the Lizalfos chattered amongst themselves, and then the yellow one responded. Fi turned back to Link and translated. “They do not trust you,” she said. “They are scared and angry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. He had anticipated that they were not going to be easy to persuade.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He drew on his magic for a Soothing pulse, channeled through his fragments, and laid out their remaining food offerings. Their emotions were once again palpable to Link. Fear, distrust, resentment, and anger all emanated from the prisoners, just as Fi had said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tell her that’s okay,” he said. “She doesn’t have to trust me. I just want her to take a message back to their leaders. If she agrees to stick around for me to ask some questions and give her a message, I promise we won’t harm her or her friends.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi translated his message, and the yellow Lizalfos responded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She wishes to know why you are releasing her, but not her kin.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. He hadn’t thought of a good answer to that. “Tell her that we wish we could release them too, but we need to keep them in case we need to send more messages. We don’t have any other way of communicating with the nest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That will be difficult to convey precisely, but I will do my best,” Fi said, before turning and relaying the message in their tongue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The yellow Lizalfos eyed him with suspicion, emitting a low growl before replying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She says that she will agree to answer your questions, but you must release the other two. She will stay in their place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. Link cocked his head. He hadn’t anticipated that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thinking about it, that only increased his estimation that he was doing the right thing here. If any of the rest of the Lizalfos were that protective of their own…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yeah. He was only planning to release one of them, but he <i>really</i> didn’t want to risk antagonizing them further. He didn’t really have a choice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” he said after a moment. “I’ll release one now, and another after she answers my questions to my satisfaction. How’s that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi relayed his words. The yellow Lizalfos chirped, then nodded. She seemed to communicate something with the others.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She assents,” Fi confirmed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded to her. He called out to the team to let them know what he was doing, then approached one of the brown-green Lizalfos and undid its bonds. The creature eyed him warily before snatching up some food and quickly disappearing into the night, giving the camp a wide berth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link watched it go while also keeping an eye on the others. The yellow Lizalfos was the key to making this work, and they were in for a rough and dangerous time of it if he wasn’t careful. With a deep breath, he turned back to Fi, ready to begin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He settled onto the ground, the cool earth beneath him offering some measure of grounding that helped steady his thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“First question: does she have a name?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi translated his question. The creature regarded them both with an unblinking stare before focusing intently on Link, her tail twitching in agitation. “Glik’ka,” she said clearly, her voice shrill, yet gravelly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gulped. The uncanny intelligence she displayed was unnerving. “Hello, Glik’ka,” he said, trying to inject some warmth into his tone. “I’m Link.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi relayed his greeting, but it was clear that Glik’ka was not interested in pleasantries. She only glared at him, her sharp teeth bared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Master, I believe you may have run afoul of some cultural taboo in the course of this conversation,” Fi said. “I am unsure of how to best proceed should you wish for continued cooperation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright then…” he said, racking his mind for a solution, but he didn’t have any better ideas than to keep going. He cleared his throat, trying to push through the unease that had settled in the pit of his stomach. “Next question. Why were they tracking us earlier?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi translated. Glik’ka snorted and responded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She says they were not tracking you,” Fi relayed. “They were out hunting when they came upon your group. They followed you because you pose a threat to their nesting grounds.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link raised an eyebrow. “Do you know if she’s telling the truth?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say with any degree of certainty, Master,” Fi said evenly. “Lizalfos physiology and psychology is substantially different from Hylians. I would need much more time with them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded. That figured. “Alright, well. Taking that on faith for now, please tell her that we don’t wish to harm them, or their nest. We’re here on completely unrelated business.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi’s hues shifted as she paused to think, likely considering the best way to convey his message. A moment later, she relayed his query. The Lizalfos regarded them both with a cold eye, its tail twitching faster now. It spoke in short, terse bursts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She does not believe you,” Fi said. “And further, I believe she is attempting to communicate obscenities and threats.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Great,” Link muttered. “Okay then, can you ask her what I can do to earn her trust?” He tried to keep his voice calm despite the rising tension.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi translated his question to Glik’ka, who took a moment to consider her response. This time, the Lizalfos spoke at length, her voice low and rumbling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She wants to know why you are here if not for their eggs,” Fi said, “She says you are not welcome in their nesting grounds, because you are not kin.”  Fi cocks her head to the side. “Apologies, Master, but that is an imperfect translation. It is the closest I can offer however without significant verbosity.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry about it,” he said. “I think I get the gist of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…She just wanted to know why they were here? That was it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Glik’ka regarded him with a critical eye, her scales gleaming in the moonlight. There was a long moment of tense silence, broken only by the rustle of the trees in the wind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link decided a truthful approach was best.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tell her we just came here to explore the temple, but that we didn’t know it was their nesting grounds,” he said. “We really don’t mean them any harm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Glik’ka relaxed slightly as Fi translated. Good, that was progress.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you ask her how long they’ve been here”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi relayed the question, and Glik’ka chirped a simple-sounding response. “The nest has always been the nest,” Fi translated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. Did they not bother keeping track of their history that far back? Or maybe he phrased the question poorly?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Specifically, I want to know how long Lizalfos have been in this area,” Link said. “Does she know when the first of their kind arrived here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi relayed his query to Glik’ka, but the response sounded much the same. “Her response is unchanged,” Fi confirmed. “She says ‘the nest has always been the nest.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link let out a frustrated sigh as he rubbed his face with both hands. They probably weren’t going to get any further with this line of questioning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about the cultists?” he asked. “The shaman, I mean, and his acolytes. What are their leaders like?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi shifted colors as she took well over a minute to compose and relay her translation. Glik’ka’s response was likewise lengthy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The chieftain is wise, and shares his wisdom with the blessed,” Fi said. “The chieftain provides for their tribe, and guides them in the great hunt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link furrowed his brow, taking a moment to process the words. That sounded like an oddly religious sentiment, which was surprising given what he had seen, read, and heard tales of thus far. Everyone had always assumed Lizalfos to be primarily driven by instinct and aggression, not spirituality. Their culture—at least the ones here—seemed far more sophisticated than he ever would have guessed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” he said aloud as he pondered. “That’s definitely not what I was expecting.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He really wanted to ask about the ritual Izu and the others saw, but he couldn’t think of a way to communicate how he knew about that without suggesting to Glik’ka that they had encroached on their nesting grounds directly. He was pretty sure they didn’t know much about magic, and she wouldn’t understand it if they described Scrying to her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He decided to just go for it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. Last question. What was the purpose of the ritual earlier? What happened to their prisoners?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A chill ran down Link’s spine as Fi translated and relayed Glik’ka’s response. “Our god hungers. We must feed him.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yeah. Alright. Voidspawn or no, it was going to be a difficult undertaking to convince the Lizalfos and their cult to let them enter their nesting grounds and slay their god.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head. They’d have to figure it out later. For now, he just needed to hold up his end of the bargain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A deal’s a deal” he said. “The message I want to send is this: We wish to talk with your leaders. We mean you no harm, and are willing to negotiate.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi relayed it. Glik’ka spoke first to the other remaining prisoner, then to Fi.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She says your message is to be delivered, but she cannot make any guarantees. It is out of their hands.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” Link said. “Can’t ask for much more than that, I suppose.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>True to his word, he unbound the second green-brown Lizalfos and set it free. Just as the first, it grabbed up a handful of food and took off into the night.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After Link shared what he had learned with the rest of the team, they searched for a path further into the mountains to avoid the potential of any further confrontations. Exhausted, they set up camp for the second time and did their best to get some much-needed sleep before dawn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As the sun rose on the new day, the team was greeted by the presence of three Lizalfos near their campsite, waiting patiently a moderate distance away. Two of them were heavily armed enforcers, while the other appeared to be an acolyte. They did not appear friendly in the slightest, and the entire team was on edge. Link knew that he needed to act quickly if they were going to defuse the situation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Summoning Fi from the aether, Link bid her to take a message from the delegation and welcome them to the edge of their camp as he went with Izu to meet them. She did so, and the delegation approached.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Master, the acolyte demands for Glik’ka to be released into their custody, and that you leave this area at once,” she translated. “He says that you are not welcome here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link took a deep breath, trying to keep his cool despite the gravity of the situation. He knew that this was a critical moment, and that their response would determine entirely how their mission here unfolded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At his side, Izu turned to Link with arms crossed. “I’m going to be level with you. I think we all saw this coming.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We still have to try,” Link said, more out of desperation than anything. “They seemed eager to sacrifice their previous prisoners. Maybe they’ll just let us pass if we ask?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu raised a skeptical eyebrow and pondered that, then deflated as he gestured towards the envoy as if to say, “be my guest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, tell them we wish to appeal to their god directly,” Link instructed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish, Master.” Fi turned to the envoys and spoke a few words in their tongue. As she finished, the acolyte immediately hunched over and emitted a rhythmic chirping sound. A moment later, the two enforcers joined in.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…They’re laughing, aren’t they?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded slowly. “Seems like it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed they are, Master,” Fi confirmed. “Specifically, I believe they are mocking you by expressing disingenuous amusement at your suggestion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grumbled under his breath as the acolyte recovered and spoke a few more words to Fi.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He insists you release Glik’ka,” she said. “Only then will he entertain your folly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link felt a twinge of apprehension. The stakes were getting higher, and the possibility of violence seemed more and more inevitable. But he couldn’t let that stop him. He had to try to find a peaceful resolution. He had to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” he muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He felt a lump form in his throat as he made his way over to Glik’ka. The team was silent as he passed through them—their thoughts on this plan evident on their faces.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He approached Glik’ka and began to loosen her binds. She eyed at him and then glanced towards the team before bowing her head slightly and scurrying away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link marched back to the delegation. “Okay,” he said firmly. “Ask them again. We wish to appeal to their god. Tell them we mean them no harm.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>As Fi spoke, Link channeled his magic and focused on his fragments of Courage to emit a Soothing pulse, doing his best to convey his determination to follow his conscience, and his sense of goodwill and desire to find a peaceful solution.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lizalfos watched him with quizzical expressions. Glik’ka, huddled behind the others, looked on as well, and then spoke to the acolyte.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She is telling him that you had many opportunities to hurt her and her kin, but that you chose not to, aside from taking them hostage,” Fi said. “And that, despite your intrusion, she believes you are sincere.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>The acolyte nodded to Glik’ka and paced away, then quickly spun back and swiped his talon across her face, drawing blood. Link felt a rush of anger and frustration, but he couldn’t do anything to interfere.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The acolyte motioned to one of the enforcers, who shoved Glik’ka and pointed towards the temple. Glik’ka backed away while bowing subserviently, then disappeared into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The acolyte then turned to Fi and chirped a response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He says that if you insist on meeting your fate at the talons of Kith’raxis, they will not bar your path,” Fi said.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>And with that, the delegation left.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned to Izu. He seemed equally baffled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn paced over. “It’s a trap. It’s got to be a trap, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm…” Link scratched his head. “I don’t know. I don’t think so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>If he was being completely honest with himself, he didn’t expect to get this far.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can Fi tell us if he was telling the truth?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t work with Lizalfos,” Link said. “She’d need a lot more time with them.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Grenja said as he strolled over. “What are we waiting for? An invitation?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu grunted in frustration. “I won’t lie,” he said. “I’d rather not take any unnecessary chances. But if you’re dead set on doing it this way…?” He looked Link over.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded firmly, feeling real conviction for the first time since this mess started. “I am. It’s hard to explain, but…” He shook his head. “I’m always asking myself, all the time, ’What would a real Lightsworn do?’ A selfless warrior, sworn to uphold justice, to protect the realm from evil, to act with the grace of Hylia in all things?” He met Izu’s gaze. “Can you imagine a Lightsworn coming here and wiping out an entire tribe of Lizalfos just because it’s the least risky option?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Izu replied tersely. “No, I cannot, Link.” He still looked uneasy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. “It’s not like I don’t understand the danger I’m putting us in, Izu. I do. All too well, actually.” He briefly reminisced on his encounters in the Spire as he held his necklace in hand. The horrors of the Haunted Pass. The scars he and his team still bore from their experiences there.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Which is why I’m going alone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Like fick you are,” Ryn said. “You don’t get to hog all the glory for yourself. Not this time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh, yeah Link,” Koja added. “That’s about the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard you say.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja crossed his arms. “Exactly. I don’t care what you say—if you think you’re going in there alone, think again.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu eyed Link, then glanced back at his team as if to ask, “Are you willing to risk their lives too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s their decision to make,” Link said sharply, glaring back at him. “And yours too. All of you,” he added, turning to face the others. “Listen: I understand if you want to sit this one out. In fact, that might be the better option so that there’s someone left if we—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—For fick’s sake, Link, will you listen to yourself?!” Izu snapped. He paced away, ran a hand through his hair, then whipped back. “Real life isn’t a story! It doesn’t always go the way you hope it will! We have no guarantees whatsoever that the Lizalfos won’t attack us when we get there, or ambush us at the first opportunity! Or do you think they’re going to just let us waltz in, carrying all our weapons and equipment with us? Hmm? How do you think they’ll respond if we insist on carrying weapons with us onto the lift? And even if we succeed—what then? Do you think they’re going to let us just walk out of there unharmed after killing their god?! We don’t even know how we can activate the lift from below! We don’t even—Mother’s Mercy, man! There is faith, and then there is… there is…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Pure exasperation. He motioned with an upturned palm from Link’s head to his feet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu took a calming breath, then continued at a more even keel. “If you want me and my team to literally follow you into the abyss, then you had best have a damned good plan. This ‘be the hero’ shit isn’t going to cut it.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>Dead silence. Link could hear his heart beating in his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He winced and grit his teeth. After a moment of internal deliberation and reflection, he turned his head with a pained sigh. He could argue several points there, but he knew that on the whole, Izu was right. He massaged his sword arm, still feeling the memory of the pain fresh in his mind, though it had been healed for some time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks. I needed to hear that,” he muttered, feeling empty. “It’s just—when I don’t see a way forward, but there’s still hope, I take the leap, you know? And I have faith that I’ll figure it out as I go. But no, you’re right. That’s burned us before, and it’s no excuse to go in without a proper plan. We don’t need to make the same mistake again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu crossed his arms as he looked Link over. “Sorry to be so blunt, but it had to be said. I’m just glad to see you come to your senses.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grunted in acknowledgement. “But I still want to try talking with them. I don’t resort to violence unless our hand is forced. Are you with me on that, at least?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu eyed him skeptically. “Link. They’re Lizalfos—legendarily untrustworthy. And every indication is that they’re controlled by a cult and have been brainwashed into thinking that a malevolent voidspawn is their god. They make sacrifices. Regular ones, for all we know. Hylian sacrifices. Zoran sacrifices. Who knows what else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know, I know,” Link said, holding up a hand. “But they’re people too. They have thoughts, emotions, language, culture—family. Just like us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So did the bandits.” Grenja said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned to face him. “Huh?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m just sayin’, you had no problem bashing the bandits into pulp,” Grenja said with a shrug.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s—I… what?” Link said. “Of course I did! We tried getting them to surrender first, and they just attacked us like madmen! And besides, that’s different. They chose lawlessness.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Looks the same here if you ask me,” Grenja said. “Only difference is, the Lizalfos haven’t attacked us yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link glared at him. “Grenja, that’s exactly my point.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja held up his hands. “Hey, I’m not questioning your calls. Just telling you like I see it. You want to give diplomacy a shot? No problem with me. I’ve got your back no matter what.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He’s not wrong,” Ryn said. “I mean, I’m all for peaceful solutions, but you heard what Fi said. We aren’t welcome.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? No, after that he said they won’t bar our path,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm…” Koja. She held up a finger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sighed and rubbed his face. “Go ahead.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pretty sure that was just his way of saying they’d be happy to feed us to—what did he say? Kath’rax?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Kith’raxis,” Kellin corrected.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right,” Koja said with a slight shudder. “Yeah, uhm. I really don’t get the impression there’s much more to it than that. If the plan isn’t to march straight into the maw of the beast…” She frowned. “Sorry. What exactly is the plan?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still working that out,” Ryn said</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Riiiight,” Koja said, drawing the word out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stared at them, dumbfounded. “You all think going straight in there is a bad idea?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja, Koja, and Ryn all looked between each other, then nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And you were going to follow me anyway?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>More nods.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“WHY?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhm,” Ryn said, holding out a palm. “Because you’re a ficking Lightsworn? The Queen’s Champion, chosen of Farore, wielder of three ficking fragments of the Triforce of Courage? Sexiest guy in a thousand leagues? Please, I’d never forgive myself if I let you die in there alone.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin groaned. “Keep it in your pants, sweetheart.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Blow me,” Ryn said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja cleared his throat. “Personally, I was expecting things to go south as soon as we got there. It might get dicey, but I’m pretty sure we can take ’em.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, more or less that,” Koja said. “You might not always have the best plan going in, but I’m not ever going to bet against you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gawked at them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, Link. I get it,” Izu said, drawing attention back to himself. “I understand that you want this to work out for the best. I just don’t see a path forward that works out like you want it to. None of us do. Not if we want to explore that temple.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. So what if we’re honest with them?” Link said. “What if we tell them exactly why we’re here. Exactly who we are and what our mission is. Tell them everything. About Hylia, Demise, Ganondorf, the Blight, Ja’bu—everything. If we can convince them we’re on the same side…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what makes you think they’ll believe us?” Izu said. “We have no proof. Maybe if Shesan were here and could show them one of her visions? But no—we’re just some Hylians to them. Hylians encroaching on their territory after pissing them off and being told to leave.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have my Soothe,” Link says. “Boosted by my fragments. It gives me a connection—lets me feel emotions and communicate empathetically. Hard to explain. It’s worked multiple times now to charm them, and I think I can use it to convince them I’m telling the truth. I just need time, and the right opening.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu scratched his chin. “Maybe. It’s a stretch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hung his head, then stood up straight. “Okay, look: Unless any of you have objections as to why this plan is unworkable, I want to give it a shot. We scry ahead to make sure there aren’t any surprises, head in until we meet some more Lizalfos, talk with them, then reassess. If we can convince enough of them—get them talking to each other while showing over and over that we mean them no harm—then I think that’s worth a shot. If things look bad, we back out. And we can be prepared for a fight—that’s fine. But I’m not willing to draw blood first. That clear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded along slowly, then shrugged. “Alright, yeah. That’s fair. It’s not the worst plan. Not the best one either, but it’s not bad.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link glanced toward the others. More nods, and murmurs of assent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” he said with finality. “Then let’s make it happen.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The team chose to leave behind the oxgoats and their heavier equipment at the camp, taking only what they could carry. Some food, various tools, and their weapons and armor. Additionally, they brought the stone disk and the transfabrulator. The journey back to the forest took longer than expected, as they had to detour around a swamp on the way back in. Far fewer fiends that way, and none of them poisonous.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Around midday, Kellin informed the team that they were being followed. Ten Lizalfos this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn Scried ahead to the temple, her eyes turning white and her head jerking back as she went through the motions. A moment later, she communicated what she saw to the team. The Lizalfos at the temple were on high alert and seemingly prepared for a fight. There were dozens of them on the walls, armed with spears, bows and arrows, and blowdarts. The shaman, several acolytes, and eight enforcers waited atop the steps at the nearest entrance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So hear me out,” Koja said, “but I don’t think that sounds like a welcoming party.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. No it does not,” Izu said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The way I see it, we only have two options,” Grenja said. “Fight or run. So which is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not yet,” Link said defiantly. “I know it’s tense, but we still have a chance to make this work. Fi, I want you to try talking to one of the ones tracking us. Tell them we’re friendly, and ask if they’d like to talk with us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Master,” Fi responded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The team watched as her avatar appeared nearby and glided away towards one of the Lizalfos. The Lizalfos immediately panicked, attacked and dispersed her avatar, screeched out a warning, then fled. The others scattered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm—I did not expect that,” Link said, stunned. “Okay, yeah. We should—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I feel strange,” Koja said, “Really tired all of a sudden. I think I… I think…” She scratched her neck, stumbled, then fainted in the middle of the party.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Poison dart!” Jedal exclaimed as he examined her. He removed the quill from her skin and picked her up in a soldier’s carry.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Retreat! Let’s get out of here!” Izu commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Muttering a curse under his breath, Link drew his sword and donned his shield. He took up one flank as the party formed up and began to flee—</span>
<br><br>
<span>He jumped as he heard a strange popping sound, followed by a hissing noise as a thick, acrid dust cloud enveloped them. The odor was completely overpowering, and he choked on the fumes. His vision swam and he began to feel woozy.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No!</i> He couldn’t… he wouldn’t…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head vigorously and dashed ahead, trying desperately to fight it, to escape the…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link came to his senses and found himself tied to a stake, surrounded by a throng of Lizalfos in the courtyard of the compound. The rest of the party was restrained with him.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Alright. Don’t panic,</i> he thought to himself. It was not looking good, but at least they were alive. It wasn’t over yet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The shaman finished his address to the crowd and began activating the lift. Link struggled against his binds, but it was no use. He attempted to call out to the others, but they were still unconscious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The lift sunk down into the abyss, and the sunlight gradually faded away, leaving them in shadow. A few seconds later, a dim reddish light, like the color of a twilight sky, lit up the platform with an eerie, unnatural glow. As they descended, the intensity of the light increased until he could clearly see the surroundings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The air was thick with surreal motes of black fog, and Link found it difficult to see through it. The cavern they found themselves in was enormous, far larger than anything he could have imagined. He couldn’t even make out the ceiling above. And as they reached the ground below, he saw that the area around the platform was covered in bones and scraps of equipment, all lit with that strange red hue that appeared to emanate from everywhere at once.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The shaman said something to the enforcers. Link tried to communicate with Fi to get her to translate, but her avatar was instantly attacked and destroyed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pair of enforcers lifted Link’s stake and hurled him off the platform onto the ground, then the others one by one. They were all still wearing their armor—thank the Goddesses—but their weapons were missing. His too, he noted. He still had the stone tablet strapped to his side, but his sword and shield were nowhere to be found.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The lift activated and rose back up, leaving them alone in this vile place. Link struggled again, but his binds held fast. A distant roar echoed against the walls of the cavern, sending shivers down his spine. Then again. Slightly louder. Closer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s heart pounded in his chest. His magic ignited in his veins as he strained in futility against his bindings, desperate to break free. His mind raced as he tried to come up with a plan, but he couldn’t—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Behind and to his left he heard a pained cry that shifted into a low growl. Gazra!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Over here!” Link called to him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sound of snapping ropes, and a moment later Link was free. He stretched and flexed his aching wrists, then immediately set to work helping unbind the others. None of them were lucid yet, but Koja and Izu were stirring.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ground shook. Slightly at first, but it grew in intensity with each passing breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was working to free Kellin now. Once he had her loose, he slapped her, hard. She immediately came to, eyes darting around in a panic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Quickly!” he said, motioning to the others. “There’s no time!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Groggily, she set to work helping him and Grenja rouse the rest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A deafening roar shook the cavern, and Link wheeled about. The monster that emerged from the darkness in the distance was unlike anything he had seen before. A towering lizard-like abomination with jagged spikes running down its back, its eyes glowing red with malice, and its long, misshapen maw filled with rows and rows of spiny teeth. Molten rock seemed to flow along its spine under its scales, and its massive, clawed forearms looked like they could mangle an oxgoat with ease.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wilted under the gaze of Kith’raxis—the dread god of the Lizalfos—then steeled himself for an impossible fight. He glanced back at the team. At least everyone was on their feet. But they were all weaponless, groggy from poison, and with no room to maneuver.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t looking good. If any of them survived this…</span>
<br><br>
