<span>“Oh, looks like we’re here,” Ryn said, turning about. “Huh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stumbled to a halt, coming back to himself. They had arrived sooner than he was expecting. How long had they been walking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He scanned ahead. Layers of painted rock rose to sharp peaks on either side of a narrow pass, and craggy cliffs stretched off into the distance in both directions. The pass itself was shielded from the sun by the surrounding mountains, and at its mouth stood an obsidian obelisk that rose several meters from the ground. A thick desert fog rolled in over the ridges in the distance. The fog, together with the morning sun, cast eerie shadows on the basin ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, that’s ominous,” Koja said, coming to a stop beside Ryn. She crossed her arms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sis, you know this place is haunted, right?” Grenja said from atop a small boulder a few paces away. “Of course it’s gonna be all ominous and shit. What’d you expect?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right, of course,” Koja said, touching a hand to her forehead. “How silly of me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link couldn’t place it exactly, but something felt off. He glanced back from where they had come. Just sandy dirt and clumps of desert brush as far as he could see. He peered around. Nothing unusual. Nothing stood out, or caught his attention.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A low wind picked up, blowing sand and dust in his face. Link pulled his mask up and trotted along towards the pass. The others followed closely behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He didn’t like this place. The prospect of finding another fragment excited him, and above all he was driven by determination and purpose to see Hylia’s will done—assuming they had come to the right place. But at the same time, his nerves were on edge. His mouth felt dry, and he could feel his pulse in his ears. Despite his hopes, they had found little to no useful information. Just the stories and his visions. They were going in blind to an unknown situation, and that was always a risky venture.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite his determination and sense of duty, he felt eager to be done here. The sooner they could get back to Hyrule, the better. The Goddesses only knew how much trouble the kingdom was in, and they were so far away…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhm, Link? Buddy?” Grenja said, setting a hand on his shoulder. “You okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link snapped to. He found himself standing in front of the obelisk, trailing his fingers along its surface. It felt cold and smooth, and had unfamiliar writing etched along the edges.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhhh… yeah,” he said, blinking hard and shaking his head. He pulled his hand away. “I mean—no. No. Definitely not. Something’s wrong.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aww, don’t tell me you’re cuccoin’ out on me already,” Grenja said with a grin. “Come on, man—where’s that heroic spirit? Did you forget why we came here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Link said uneasily. “No, it’s just…” He looked back over his shoulder to the other two. Koja was sitting down on a rock next to Ryn, while Ryn’s eyes had gone white. She must be scrying ahead. Good thinking.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Why hadn’t they done that sooner?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm. I see,” Grenja said. His grin faded and he adopted a more serious posture. “So tell me, what’s got you spooked?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned back to the obelisk, examining the writing more closely. “I don’t know,” he said, half-distracted. What <i>was</i> he worried about?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The writing wasn’t anything he was familiar with. More Old Script, maybe? Odd. He thought for sure by now he had enough familiarity to recognize at least some of the runes. “Hey Fi, can you read this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi?” Link whirled about, panic rising. “…Fi?! Fi, where are you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here! I’m here!” Fi called out. She ran up and stopped in the middle of the group, taking a second or two to catch her breath. “Sorry I’m late. I left something back at camp.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nuh-uh, no excuses,” Grenja said firmly, pointing a finger her way. “Remember, Fi: we’re on a mission! You had better not let that happen again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, you’re right,” Fi said, holding up her hands. “I won’t, I promise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh-huh. Yeah, that’s right,” Grenja said, striking an intimidating pose.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link glanced between the two of them, dumbfounded. <i>What the fick!?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link! Are you listening to me?” Link turned. Ryn was at his side. She looked worried.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ryn, something’s wrong,” Link said. “Fi—she has arms!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, so you noticed!” Fi said from behind, sounding cheerful. She twirled about, fluttering her hands in the air like a bird. “Do you like them? I thought they’d make me look more Hylian.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link boggled at her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No?” She frowned. “Link, I have to admit, you’re making me kind of nervous. I had hoped you of all people would understand that the situation is exceedingly dire, Master. Regardless of you believe you are seeing, you must—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Greetings, travellers!” an unfamiliar voice said. “Might I ask—<i>aahhh!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link spun to see Grenja holding a strange man by the throat, his other hand raised threateningly. “Who are you?! What are you doing here?! How’d you find us?!” the titan of a man bellowed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja! Stand down!” Link commanded, bolting over. Grenja grunted and backed off, but not before shoving the man to the dirt. Link brushed passed him and helped the stranger to his feet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked him over. He wore a brown wool cloak, hemmed in blue, and had thick, curly black hair. Was he Gerudo? Hylian? Link couldn’t tell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem,” the man said, dusting himself off. “Thank you.” He extended a hand. “Urik.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Warily, Link took his hand, giving it a firm shake. “Link,” he said. “What business do you have here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why, I was just about to ask you the same thing,” the man said with a nervous laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link glanced back to his teammates. Ryn was arguing with Grenja, while Koja stood off to the side, shaking her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So,” Urik said. “What <i>are</i> you doing here, if you don’t mind my asking?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link considered for a moment how much he should volunteer. He had no idea who this man was or what his intentions were. He was certainly no bandit…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re on a mission,” Link said carefully. “Official Hylian business. I’m the Queen’s Champion, and we’re here following up on rumors of a haunted mountain pass. We were hoping to find information about an old Gerudo King. I don’t suppose you know anything about Ibboso the Damned?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ibboso the…?” Urik frowned, scrunching up his face in confusion. “You mean—ahha! I mean, uh.” He coughed, turning his head and muttering something Link didn’t catch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link raised an eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, sorry, no,” Urik said. “I’m afraid I don’t know anything about Ibboso the Bold. <i>Damned!</i> I don’t know anything about Ibboso the Damned!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link regarded him dubiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You really expect us to believe that?” Koja said, strolling up to stand at Link’s side. “Hah! I never thought I’d meet a worse liar than Grenj.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen,” Urik said somberly, gesturing with both hands. “There’s still time. You and your friends need to leave this place while you still can!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not gonna happen, bud!” Grenja said. “We’re not leavin’ here ’till we get answers!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik turned again, pacing as he muttered to himself. “<i>No!</i>” he said under his breath. “I am not going… No! You can’t—UURRRAAAAAGGH!” The man suddenly doubled over in pain. He fell to the ground, shaking and holding his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hesitated, unsure what to do. He glanced to Koja, before—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik rose to his feet in a single smooth motion, as if lifted from above like a marionette.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Um, you okay over there?” Koja asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am,” Urik said. His eyes had glazed over, and his voice sounded different, as if a second voice spoke in unison behind his. Link couldn’t be sure, but the second voice sounded softer, maybe. Feminine?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He pointed at Link. “You. You are Lightsworn. Yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link started, taking a step back and reaching for his sword. “How do you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I can tell,” Not-Urik said. “You have the… scent.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… <i>what</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, I don’t like this,” Ryn whispered in his ear. “I think we should leave.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, totally with Ryn on this one,” Koja said. “We should leave. Now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nonsense!” Grenja said. “What are you afraid of? Just ’cause his voice got all weird and girly? Pfft.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned to his teammates, careful not to take his eye off the stranger. “We can’t leave,” he said. “Not yet. We knew what we were getting into by coming here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja let out a long, low groan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link!” Ryn said quietly. “Will you <i>please</i> just listen—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I hear you,” Link said. “Look, we’ll be careful, alright? At the first sign of any real danger, we’ll leave and reassess. Okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn turned and paced, hands on her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This will do nicely,” Urik said. Link spun. The man now stood three paces in front of the group, holding a purple gemstone up in the air. <i>Link’s</i> purple gemstone. The key he still carried from the Obsidian Spire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey! How did you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik held up a hand. Despite himself, Link fell silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Where did you find this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s none of your…” Link shook his head. “That’s… uh… one of the gemstones from the Obsidian Spire. We just came from there. It worked on some of the locked doors there without…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik held up his hand again. “This changes matters considerably,” he said. “I know why you are here. I may be able to help you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link regarded him with suspicion. “You mean with Ibboso? What do you know about him? Is this… is this where…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik ignored his questions as he walked through the group. They parted, giving him a wide berth. He stopped in front of the obelisk and tapped it with one finger. Immediately, it flew apart into segments. The segments twisted and turned as they hung in the air, in defiance of all reason. A moment later the segments recombined into… a differently shaped obelisk?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link and the others gaped in awe. Who was this man?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Come. Follow me,” Urik said, beckoning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite his misgivings, Link felt compelled to follow the stranger. Unholy possession by an otherworldly entity aside, he knew something they didn’t, and was obviously familiar with this place. Link glanced again to his teammates as they shuffled along. They looked just as confused and befuddled as he was.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>They followed Urik through the pass, along a ridge, and down a slight incline. Before long they came upon a small, dilapidated town. Twenty or so stone buildings stood in a loose cluster, staggered along the hillside. The buildings were in various stages of disrepair, ranging from “mostly intact” to “had definitely seen better days.” Trees and brush had reclaimed much of the space, though a wide cobbled path was still evident, leading straight through the center of the town. The path branched halfway through: the left branch led out of the town and disappeared into the foggy basin below, while the right path wound around a hill closer to the cliffs. Atop the hill, straight ahead, sat a much larger building that loomed over the rest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stopped in his tracks as he sensed movement. Was he imagining it, or had someone just darted across the way? Squinting and shielding his eyes from the sun, he thought he saw someone watching them from atop a roof as well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Did people actually live out here? Was it not haunted after all?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stay close,” Urik said. “The locals will not bother you so long as you are with me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The locals?” Link and Koja said in tandem.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Stay close</i>,” Urik repeated. “Follow me. Do not stop, no matter what.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They did as he said, following close behind. What was he so worried about?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are those… kids?” Grenja said as they entered the town.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked to where he pointed. Sure enough, three children hid—rather poorly—behind a well near the center of town, their heads poking out from behind the stone column. They wore tattered rags and looked downright emaciated, like they hadn’t eaten in days.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do not mind the children,” Urik said sternly. “Follow me. We are almost there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But they’re so thin!” Grenja said. “Why are they so thin?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Poor harvests,” Urik said after a moment. “It happens from time to time. Do not mind them. <i>Follow me</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Poor harvests my ass!” Grenja said, throwing his hands up. “We have plenty of food back at camp. We can feed them!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bro, we can’t just—” Koja began.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Don’t give me that shit,” Grenja spat. “Look at them—they’re starving! We can go raid some more bandit camps if we need to. I don’t care what you say, I am not about to leave these kids to starve to death.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something about this was very, very wrong. Every instinct in Link’s body screamed at him, but the level of alarm he felt was completely at odds with the situation at hand. He looked back towards the children and saw that a crowd of villagers had gathered there now, edging towards them. They didn’t appear to be armed, or in any way dangerous. If anything they looked curious. Frightened?</span>
<br><br>
<span>A young woman caught his eye and called to him, waving. “Sir? Will you help us? Please, sir, we need your help!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, no! What did they need help with? Link—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn grabbed his hand. She shook her head slowly, a grave look in her eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I will feed the children,” Urik said, capturing Link’s attention. He stood inches from Grenja’s face, holding the purple gemstone next to his head. It pulsed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You… will feed… the children,” Grenja repeated, in an apparent stupor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You do not need to worry about the children.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t… need to worry…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good,” Urik said. “Now follow me. Quickly!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link! Are you listening?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned back to Ryn. “What? Ryn, I don’t understand. What’s—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Koja! Hey, sweetie,” Ryn said. She sped along, taking Koja by the shoulders. It looked like she had stopped to gather flowers along the path. “Come on, this way! Just like the nice man said.” Ryn turned and motioned frantically for Link to follow as they passed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link followed. He reached for his sword, but… why was he reaching for his sword? Where was his sword?!</span>
<br><br>
<span>A shrill cry of pain sounded nearby, followed by calls for help. Link froze, searching for the—</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head. No. This wasn’t right. This wasn’t <i>real</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Boy, come! Get inside, now!” Urik yelled, holding a door open and gesturing inside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Pulse pounding, Link dashed towards the building. Bodies of wounded and dying soldiers laid strewn along the path, grasping at his legs as they begged for help. Link ignored their pained moans and ragged cries as he sprinted for safety. The path ahead of him stretched out faster than he could run. He was so close, and the door was right there! Ryn stood behind Urik at the entrance, beckoning, pleading for him to get inside. Link grit his teeth and <i>ran</i>, harder and faster than he ever had in his life. He was closing the distance, but slowly. His limbs felt heavy. The light of the sun faded and shadows closed in around him. Almost… there…!</span>
<br><br>
<span>He dove inside the doorway and Urik slammed the door shut behind him, barring it from the inside. Link dragged himself to his feet and bent over, panting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja eyed him from where she sat on top of a bed. “Woah there. Where’s the fire?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t mind him. He’s just eager to slay some ghosts!” Grenja said. “Don’t worry, my man. There’ll be plenty of time for that, just as soon as we get to the graveyard. Right, Urik?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For the last time, we’re not here to slay ghosts,” Koja said with a sigh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gaped at the pair of them wordlessly, then turned back to Urik. Urik stood in front of the door, eyeing him with arms crossed. Ryn paced off to the side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stood as tall as he could manage. It was difficult; he felt dizzy, and his head ached something fierce. “Urik?” he said, after catching his breath. “Or whoever you are. Whatever you are. What in damnation is going on here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, Link?” Koja said. “Not to sound rude or anything, but—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik held up a hand. Koja fell silent. “I will explain soon enough,” Urik said, his voice still echoing eerily. “For now, I need you to stay here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No way,” Link said. “You have got to be joking. After <i>that</i>? You can’t expect—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I will explain everything soon enough,” Urik repeated. “But there is something I must do first. You and your friends will be safe, so long as you stay inside this building. Do not leave for any reason. I will return shortly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With that, the man vanished. He was simply… gone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link blinked and rubbed his eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhm, okay,” Koja said. “What just happened?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have no idea,” Link said. “I think Ryn might know something? Ryn, what—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Ficking finally!” Ryn said, swooping in from the far side of the room. “Are you ready to listen to me now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh my dear, sweet Hylia,” Grenja said, jumping to his feet. “I think that guy was using mind magic on us!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No shit!” Koja said. “You think?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Will you two shut up for one second and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Now sis, normally I’m very patient with you, but right about now I’m reaching my limits. I might not be the sharpest—”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Oww!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn slapped Link. Hard. The sound echoed off the walls. He rubbed his jaw. “What the heck? What was that for?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Belatedly, he noticed Grenja and Koja had stopped their bickering.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now—all of you—shut up and listen!” Ryn said. “Not another word. Got it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everyone nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn let out a breath. “Okay. So, I don’t know what’s going on exactly, but … not real … this place? … none of it … but it’s safe here, just like Urik said … can’t believe anything you see … some kind of shared dream, or <i>something</i> … those people out there? They’re not people! … don’t look, it makes them angry … Koja? Are you listening? I said…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link tried to listen, but he found it harder and harder to pay attention. Instead, he found his eyes drawn to Koja. She sat on the edge of the bed, trembling in fear, gripping her knees with white knuckles. What was she—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link followed her gaze to the window and nearly jumped out of his skin. There stood the gaunt, emaciated bodies of the three children from before, staring in from outside. A taller, darker figure stepped in behind them and caught Link’s eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Those red eyes. Those dark eyes. So much pain behind those eyes…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world spun. The window shattered. The walls around them crumbled to dust, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>No.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Through sheer force of will, Link tore his eyes away. The world was <i>not</i> spinning and the building was <i>not</i> collapsing around them. The room was <i>safe</i>, just like Urik said it was. He dashed forward and drew the shutters closed. Behind him, Koja fell to the ground, gasping and crying. Link turned, slouching against the wall and breathing heavily. That was… that was too close…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja rushed to his sister’s side. “Sis? Sis, what’s wrong? Talk to me!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m sorry! I didn’t know it was you! I’m sorry… I didn’t know…” Koja repeated herself over and over, sobbing under her breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link!” Ryn said, rounding on him. “Didn’t you hear me? I <i>said</i>…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tried to listen, but had trouble holding onto his thoughts. All he could think about were those dark, red eyes, staring—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Oww!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn smacked him again. Then dragged him to his feet, kissed him, and smacked him a third time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey! Stop that!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>"Wake up! Please!” Ryn said. “You can fight this! You’re stronger than this! I know you are!"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I’m with you,” Link said, rubbing his jaw. “I think. I was just making sure the others were safe. It’s hard to keep my thoughts straight, but I’m not going to give in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Keeping them…” Ryn looked from him to Koja and Grenja, and then back again. “Link, what are you talking about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head and looked around the room. Koja was sitting on the bed, staring blankly at the far wall. Grenja sat on a chair nearby, carving lines into the table with his knife.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But… weren’t they just…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, right. That wasn’t real. None of this was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something behind him caught Ryn’s eye. She covered her mouth and backed away. Her eyes went white, then she turned and paced, muttering under her breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link boggled at her. She was obviously frightened. Why was she scared? They were safe here in the house. Urik said so. Urik told them…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link very carefully did not turn around. There was nothing behind him, and nothing to worry about. He—</span>
<br><br>
<span>He jumped as a knock sounded at the door. Grenja rose to answer it. Ryn tried to block him, but he shoved past her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja! Stop!” Link shouted. Grenja stopped, turning to stare at him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hesitated. Something nagged at the back of his mind. There was something he was trying very hard <i>not</i> to think about. Somehow he needed to think about it, without actually thinking <i>about</i> it. He needed to think <i>around</i> it. He needed to get Grenja to as well.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well? What is it?” Grenja demanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh. Don’t answer the door,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The knock came again. Louder and more frantic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what if it’s Urik?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not him,” Link said. “Definitely not him.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What if it’s those kids?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stammered. He looked to Ryn pleadingly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not safe out there,” Ryn said. “We need to stay in here until Urik gets back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja looked between them. “Listen, I don’t know what you guys are so hung up about. There’s just a bunch of normal villager folks out there, probably scared shitless and wondering why we showed up at their doorstep. And those kids! Link… man… come on! You can’t tell me that seeing those kids like that doesn’t tear at your heartstrings!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not sure what to think,” Link said. “We’ll do what we can, but we might have to leave those kids to Urik.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can <i>not</i> believe I’m hearin’ this!” Grenja said. “From you, of all people? What kind of hero won’t even lift a damned finger to help some poor starvin’ kids? Didn’t Hylia send us here to save them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think what Link’s trying to say is that it’s not that simple,” Ryn said. “There’s more going on here than you realize. I know it’s hard to hear, but we can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Not that simple my ass!” Grenja said. “You and I both know that’s just what they say when it’s more convenient to make excuses than to do what’s right.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn groaned. “Will you stop interrupting me for one second and just <i>listen</i>—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Blah blah blah, you just keep yappin’. No offense, Ryn, but you’re just about to put me to sleep. Now, if you don’t get the fick out of my way—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Grenja, look at your sister!” Ryn said, pointing across the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja narrowed his eyes. “Koja? What about her?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please? Just look. Really look.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She’s fine,” Grenja said guardedly. He turned around. Slowly. “Sis, you’re fine. Aren’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja nodded, rocking herself gently. “Yeah. I’m fine. It’s okay. We’re going to be okay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja turned back to Ryn. “See? She’s fine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Thankfully, Urik chose that moment to reappear, fading into view just as abruptly as he left. He turned and pointed to Link. “You. Boy. Come with me. There is no time to waste.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link breathed a sigh of relief. Now that Urik was back, maybe he could talk sense into—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I said come with me!” Urik’s eerie wrong-voice echoed in Link’s ears, expanding to fill every corner of his mind. Link stumbled backward, then stepped forward.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Ryn said, putting herself between them. “He’s not going anywhere. Not without the rest of us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik glared at her. Ryn flinched, taking a step back, but stood, holding her ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So be it,” Urik said. “You can go, but the other two must stay.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Link said. “I’m not leaving them here. You said it was safe, but it’s—” He cut himself off as his thoughts caught up with him. “It’s, uh, not so bad,” he said. “It’s not so bad here at all. It’s actually nice and cozy. Right, Koja?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah. Nice and cozy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urik looked between them. “I miscalculated,” he said. “I apologize.” He held up the purple gemstone and it flashed in his hand. “It will not happen again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked to Ryn. She nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So long as they do not leave this place, they will be safe,” Urik said. “I swear it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Actually, I was talking to Ryn,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn grinned. “Yes, Link,” she said. “Urik’s trying to help us. It’s safe now.” She looked around the room. “I think.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gave a nod, then turned back to Koja and Grenja.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought passed his mind. He decided to go for it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Grenja?” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah? What’s up?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At arms!” Link commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja snapped to arms and gave a firm salute, right hand balled over his chest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This is a direct order,” Link said, moving to stand in front of him. “We are in hostile territory and the enemy has engaged us with unknown magical capabilities. I am leaving with Ryn and Urik to sort this out. You are to stay in this building and guard Koja with your life while we’re gone. Do not open the door. Do not open the window. Do not peer outside the shutters. No matter what happens, do not do anything but sit beside your sister and keep her company until we return. Is that clear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sir, yes sir!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Repeat your orders.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>"Sir! Situation hostile; code deadrock. I am to remain in the building and guard Koja with my life. I will not open the door. I will not open the window. I will not peer outside the shutters. I will not do anything but sit and keep sis company until you return. Orders received—loud and clear, sir!"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No matter what happens,” Link repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sir! No matter what happens.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Dismissed,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja nodded and pulled up a seat beside Koja without another word. Link looked back to Ryn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good thinking,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you recall, I said we had no time to waste,” Urik said. “That was <i>two minutes ago</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. Link furrowed his brow. “But if we aren’t supposed to… ah. Okay then.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link found himself standing in the middle of decrepit ruins; the remains of a place long forgotten. The town—if it could be called that—was in far worse shape than he had seen at first. The “building” they had just left was little more than four mostly-intact walls, open to the sky above. Urik’s cloak was draped over the doorway, and a thin shimmering barrier surrounded it on all sides.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Come,” Urik said, gesturing ahead. “Keep your eyes down.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Around them, several—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Ryn grabbed Link’s hand and squeezed tight. “Don’t look,” she said. “Please. I can resist the draw, but you can’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The draw?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s what I’m calling it,” Ryn said. “I can break it by Scrying. Maybe you should try that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link considered. He wasn’t very practiced at Scrying, but if it meant—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not <i>now</i>, you idiot,” Ryn said. “I mean, if it happens again. But seriously, just don’t look.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Will you two hurry it up?” Urik said. “We are running out of time. He is not a patient man.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link and Ryn exchanged glances. For not the first time, he wished he had listened to her sooner.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Urik led them through the ruins, along the branching path that wound around the hill. Link kept his eyes on his feet, ignoring the shadows that danced at the path’s periphery.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, is that you?” a familiar voice called out. It sounded just like Javin—his old squadmate from years back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link didn’t answer him. He kept his eyes down. That wasn’t Javin. Javin died two years ago.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, where are you going?” Not-Javin said. “We need your help! Remmi—she’s trapped in the barn! Link—where are you going?! She’s going to die if you don’t save her!”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>It wasn’t real</i>, Link kept reminding himself. No matter what he heard, no matter what he saw, none of it was real. He was walking beside Ryn, and Urik was taking them to meet with Ibboso. Urik was a strange man, possessed by a strange spirit, but he was here to help them. Link was safe so long as he stayed with Urik. He was safe so long as he didn’t look.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The neighing of horses. A wagon rolled up beside them, moving at a leisurely pace. “Papa, can I drive now?” a young boy said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s heart skipped a beat. This wasn’t… it couldn’t be…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not now,” Karindal said. “Maybe later, son. We need to keep pace with the caravan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But papa! How am I supposed to learn if you don’t ever let me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mind your father, dear,” Orra said. “Get back to your studies.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You never let me do anything!” the boy said. “Uncle Raolin always lets me do stuff. Why can’t I stay with him?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I <i>knew</i> that man was a bad influence,” Orra said softly. “You never should have let that lecher near the boy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t you talk bad about Uncle!” the boy said. “He’s not a lecher. He’s cool!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not now, Orra,” Father said sternly. “Not in front of Arlinkar.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s not my name!” the younger Link said. “I told you not to call me that!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For the last time—you are not a common peasant boy, <i>Arlinkar</i>,” Father said. “Now mind your manners, and get back to your studies. Goddesses help me, I will make a nobleman out of you yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nuh-uh,” younger Link said. “You can’t make me. I’m gonna enlist at Talus in two years—just you watch! I’m gonna be just like Uncle! Isn’t that right, mister? Mister? Hellooo? I’m talking to you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link winced. Was he really that bothersome as a child? “Leave me alone,” he said. “Go away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn eyed him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry,” Link said. “The draw.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn squeezed his hand again. “Just ignore it. It’s not real.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Am too real!” younger Link said. “See? Watch. I can drive the wagon!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, son, you can’t drive,” Father said. “I told you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Why not? I’m bored back here and I already finished all my work, just like you said. Please, papa?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No,</i> Link thought to himself. <i>Please. Not this.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine, if you promise to behave,” Father said with a sigh. “But just for a few minutes.” The boy laughed with glee. “Here, take the reins. Gently. Easy does it now—woah, not like that! Stop, you’re going to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wagon rocked violently, then knifed to the side and veered off the path. Link heard the shattering of wood as a wheel broke. He closed his eyes and covered his ears, humming to himself to drown out the noise.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>It’s not real. It’s not real. It’s not…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He opened his eyes. He was standing on a cobbled path in an open field beside a wagon with a broken wheel. His father banged at the dowels with a hammer as he worked swiftly to replace it. A younger version of himself stood off to the side, crying as his stepmother chided him for his folly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not this,” Link said to himself. “Anything but this.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A shadow passed overhead, and a cold chill ran down his spine. The kargarok’s shrill cry sounded out over the field. Link tore his eyes away from the scene as he sped along the path. Urik and Ryn were still there, just ahead. He wasn’t lost yet, and he was not going to be taken in. He ran, not looking back, ignoring the terrified shrieks of his stepmother and shutting out the memory of his father forcing him into the iron chest. He closed his eyes as he passed a weeping child on the path, holding onto the broken and bloodied remains of his parents. “You did this!” the child accused him as he ran. “You did this! It’s all your fault! Come back here and face your mistake!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link caught up with Ryn and Urik just as they passed under an archway. Ryn looked to him, worried.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m okay,” Link said. “It’s okay. It’s behind me now. It’s all behind me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re worrying me, Link,” Ryn said. “You sure you’re okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Link said, doing his best to stay calm. His heart pounded in his chest. He looked around, bewildered. They were… standing in a courtyard?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You looked, didn’t you?” Ryn groaned. “I ficking told you not to look.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I tried, okay?” Link said. “I think it’s harder for me than it is for you. I have… a lot of bad memories.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“What, and you think I don’t?” Ryn said reproachfully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Link said, rubbing his neck. “That’s not what I meant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Whatever,” Ryn said. “It’s not important.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… where’s Urik?” Link asked, noticing that they were alone in the courtyard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Urik?” Ryn said, looking confused. “What are you talking about? Who’s Urik?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, no.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All the color drained from Link’s face. He stared at Ryn in horror as he backed away. This was—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn snorted, then doubled over with laughter. “Relax, I’m just ficking with you,” she said, wiping away a tear. “Urik’s gone to get Ibboso. He said he’d right back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…That’s not funny, Ryn,” Link said bitterly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Says you,” she said. “You should’ve seen your face!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How can you laugh like that?” Link said in dismay. “This is serious!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t you get it?” Ryn said. “The only power they have over you is what you give them. See, that’s the difference between us. You dwell on your darkness. I just laugh at mine and tell it to go fick itself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link rubbed his face. Maybe she was right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A deep voice called to them from afar: “So. You are the boy Lucia speaks so fondly of?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link started, but was careful to keep his eyes on his feet. “Uh, Ryn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, that one’s real,” she said hastily. “Pretty sure that’s him.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re sure?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh huh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked up. A tall man with braided black hair and light tan skin approached them from the other end of the courtyard. He was clad in regal armor in the ancient Gerudo style—red, black, and gold. A crown made of bone sat upon his head. There was no mistaking it. This was the man from his vision.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ibboso,” Link said under his breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man stopped roughly six paces away. “My, my. And who is this fair maiden you’ve brought with you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn snorted. “Flattered, but you’re not my type.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Watch your tongue with me, you insolent whore,” Ibboso said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stepped between them. Ibboso caught his eye. Link hesitated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mighty courageous of you to walk so brazenly into my domain,” Ibboso said. He raised his sword to level at Link’s neck. A shard of gold gleamed in its hilt. “And I see you’ve brought a gift! How kind of you to bring it back to me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s hand went to his necklace. To his horror, it wasn’t there. He looked up to see Ibboso holding it by the chain. The ancient Gerudo king stopped to admire the fragment of Courage before tucking it into his belt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Stop!” Urik said from a dark corridor just ahead. “He’s Lightsworn, and chosen of the Goddesses! Hylia sent him. Please—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I SAID BE SILENT, WITCH!” Ibboso roared. A cold wind blew through the courtyard and two heavy wooden doors slammed shut, trapping Urik inside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ibboso turned back to them and laughed. “You think yourself a hero? No… you are only the pale imitation of one. I know your kind all too well. You haven’t the strength to stand before the darkness.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link, don’t listen—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn cut off abruptly. Link shivered as the hair on the back of his neck stood up. He glanced back at her and his breath caught. There she stood, petrified in mid-speech, a soft red glow around her body.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your woman isn’t going to save you, <i>boy</i>,” Ibboso said. “Now pick up your sword.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link jumped and spun as he heard the clang of metal on stone. At his feet lay his sword and shield.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ibboso…” Link began. “I’m not here to fight you. I just want to help. We can talk this through. Whatever you want, we don’t have to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Enough!” The man’s eyes narrowed as a snarl of pure rage danced across his face. His eyes burned like cinders plucked from a dying campfire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stood his ground. A tense silence hung in the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Words,” Ibboso said. “Empty words, from an empty boy. You are no Lightsworn. You are little more than a coward, playacting the hero. I have awaited this opportunity for ages, and I will not be denied my prize.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something nagged at the back of Link’s mind. He glanced back over his shoulder, out of the courtyard and towards the town below. “…You’re in pain, aren’t you?” he said. “You just want this to be over. I saw it in my vision. You and your tribe—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—You know nothing!” Ibboso said. “Do not speak about that which you do not know! Now, cease your childish prattling and pick up your weapon! You need not fear. I promise to end you swiftly.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ibboso, please—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I said pick it up!” Ibboso bellowed, dropping into a fighting stance. “You are <i>weak</i>, and <i>I</i> will take your place!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” Link yelled. “It doesn’t have to be like this!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Choose your next words carefully, boy,” Ibboso spat. “They will be your last.”</span>
<br><br>
