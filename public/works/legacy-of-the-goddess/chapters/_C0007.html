<span>Zelda sat atop a guard tower at the edge of the castle grounds, looking out over her city. The crackling firepit nearby took the bite out of the cool, Brisk air. She held her furs tight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was alone now. Well, as alone as she ever was—Link and Cove were nearby, as were her guard detail. But she was unattended for the moment, and she desperately needed the solitude. So much was required of her in day-to-day life. So many were demanding of her time and attention. Petitioners, guards, counselors, attendants, and other castle staff. It seemed scarcely an hour went by without someone looking for her. Without <i>someone</i> needing <i>something</i>. Not an hour without some urgent and important decision needing to be made that very instant, lest everything fall apart and burst into flames and be ruined forever. How could anyone be expected to make headway in that kind of environment?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She let out a sigh, toying with the empty ring on her finger. What would Father do?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He’d be proactive, she knew. He’d take initiative in a bold and daring way that solved a dozen problems at once, and everyone would heap love and adulation on him for his swift and decisive action.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As she looked out over the city, she noticed the refuse was gone. That was a relief. Even so, it frustrated her to admit she couldn’t have done better. That she wouldn’t have been able to solve the problem as quickly or as completely herself, even had it been her sole focus. Despite her misgivings, Taetus was undeniably making progress. She didn’t like him, nor his methods, but perhaps she shouldn’t be so quick to judge? True; he was greedy, self-serving, conniving, duplicitous… but also nothing if not bold, daring, and decisive when he needed to be. She couldn’t help but see the best parts of Father in him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps she should put more work towards bolstering morale now that the situation was improving? But truth be told, the fear of another assassination attempt unnerved her. And it wasn’t just her own life she had to worry about. Others had already died in her defense, and to capriciously ignore that threat would be unwise. She could assign more Sheikah to her personal guard, but she also knew that they were tasked with mitigating against the marauding Blin and bandits. Pulling more of them away only meant more people would die. It meant more damage to villages, farms, and infrastructure. A deeper hole her people would have to dig their way out of.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No. That wasn’t worth it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hadn’t been happy with the number of people at the Remembrance Day ceremony at the castle grounds—and she hadn’t been either—but both Lensa and Vestele insisted. Could she find reason to do more things like that? Despite how stressful the event was, they assured her it went a long way towards showing her subjects they were cared for. And that meant a lot to her. She <i>did</i> care about them. More than anything, she just wanted her kingdom to prosper. For her people to live long, healthy, happy lives. She certainly didn’t want them to live in fear. She wanted so badly to meet with each and every one of them. To tell them it would all be okay—that everything would be okay, and that they would pull through. To comfort them, like she had done with that child and her mother.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Would they be okay, though? She honestly wasn’t sure. Famine still loomed on the horizon. And after hearing all those names… Despite her convictions, some part of her felt like they had already lost. There was just <i>so much sorrow</i> in the world. And so much uncertainty, too. In the face of all that, and in the face of what her life demanded of her, it was too easy to want to curl up into herself and hide away. To do otherwise hurt in a way she didn’t know how to deal with. To do otherwise meant she had to face that darkness head on, and acknowledge that <i>it might not actually be okay</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The thought terrified her. How long had it been since the Old Kingdom? How many had been claimed by the Blights already? How many had died trying to stop them, and how much had been lost in perpetually keeping them at bay? She couldn’t help but feel like her people were <i>destined</i> to lose. Like their world was slowly crumbling away over the eons as a force beyond her reckoning tore at its seams.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her thoughts drifted to her conversation with Vestele. What had defeated Hylia, all those ages ago? And how could anyone stand against something that could <i>kill a goddess</i>?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda remembered the moment she shared with Link last night, looking out over the pyres spread throughout the city. She remembered the resolve she felt then. That urge to action. She felt it even now, when she called it up. She knew on some level that they had to persist—that they had no other option. That despite it all, she had to keep moving. That she had to do what she could—had to play her part. They <i>had</i> to end the Blights, at any cost.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But what did that really mean, in practical terms? It was easy to feel that resolve, but it was another thing entirely to channel it into action. Even more still to do so consistently, in the face of unending hardship.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A definite step forward would be to ensure Link also bore Hylia’s mark. Another <i>“Champion”</i> building on their Divine Power reserves could only help. There were so many things she wanted to try, and Fi never had enough reserves. Fi seemed confident however that she had almost enough power to do it. Just a few more days…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let her mind wander, and found herself fiddling with with her bracers. What else could she do right now? She was reminded of Impa’s words: <i>Nayru’s wisdom will guide you.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Did her recent nightmares mean anything? Impa would have thought so. Probably. But if they did, Zelda didn’t know what. The details varied, but… souls of the dead… plunging into the River Hylia?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shuddered at a passing breeze and inched closer to the fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was the war effort. Could she go to the front? Her presence there might inspire the troops. And if her goal was to end the Blights, there certainly wasn’t anything more direct than <i>actually fighting against the Blin</i>. But then again, Wymar never once proposed the idea to her. If he had thought doing so was a viable strategy, surely he would have suggested it? Besides, any real action she took there would likely just result in her getting in the way. And the last thing Wymar needed was to worry after her safety while fighting back the Blin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She cursed under her breath. It felt like that was all she was ever doing—getting in the way. Her greatest accomplishment thus far was effectively standing aside and delegating the rule of her city to Taetus. Maybe Lensa was right? Maybe her part in all of this was just being a glorified figurehead and doing her best to distract everyone else while the actually competent leaders made progress.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But the thought of that just made her sad. No; she had to be able to do more. She wouldn’t be able to live with herself otherwise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Idly, she wondered if the Lynx had gotten her message yet. She should probably follow up with Lensa. It was a stretch, but maybe—just maybe—their salvation laid in forging an alliance with an outside force. Especially one that might be able to shed light on the assassins, the Exiled King, and the matter of the cooperating Warlords. And if they could reestablish trade with whatever stable Gerudo blocs still existed, that might go a ways towards forestalling famine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The more she thought about it, the more important that seemed—especially in light of recent revelations. Perhaps she should go to Last Bastion herself for a face-to-face meeting with the Lynx? Or would that be too drastic? Wouldn’t that put her at greater risk? And what would that do for morale here in the city? She wasn’t sure. Something to consider, at least.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Right now, she just wanted to be alone.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A knock and a slow creak as Lensa’s face appeared in the half-open crack of the door to Zelda’s bedchamber. “You sent for me, Your Grace?” </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lensa! Yes,” Zelda said, motioning as she put away her journal. “Please, come in. Have a seat.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa entered and closed the door. She pursed her lips and tilted her head. “Is something the matter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, no. Not at all,” Zelda said. “I just haven’t had a chance to follow up with you regarding my message to the Lynx. I wanted to ask about that. Any news?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That? Pff,” Lensa waved a hand dismissively as she sat opposite of Zelda and took a glass of wine offered by Sera. “A response came the other day,” she said. “But I didn’t want to bother you with it. An emissary arrived at Last Bastion, styling herself ‘Naibi, First of the Sunseekers.’ Whatever that means.” She took a sip of wine. “At any rate, it doesn’t matter. She refused to speak to anyone and made a number of unreasonable demands. It seems she was under the impression she would be meeting with you personally.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned. “That’s… odd. Why would they demand a meeting in person? That wasn’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Come now, Zelda. Don’t let it bother you,” Lensa said, swirling the glass of wine in her hand. “We all knew it was a long shot. Still, I didn’t expect them to be so… <i>uncouth</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Why did Lensa always have to be so difficult? Zelda sighed. “No, it’s alright,” she said. “I’ll do it. I was considering going there myself anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa scoffed. “You will do no such thing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda leaned back in her chair, eyeing the older woman. Lensa, for her part, just took another sip of wine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lensa?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Speak to me like that again, and you will be removed from your office.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The countess nearly choked on her wine. She set it aside and took a timely napkin offered by Sera, wiping herself clean. “Good,” she said, laughing. “Very good. You’re learning."</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do not patronize me either,” Zelda said. “I don’t have time for your games.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa placed a hand on her hip and cocked her head. Zelda wasn’t sure what to make of the woman, though she knew very well what she was doing. Tough love was always her way. Trial by fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s your plan?” Lensa asked pointedly. “You’ve already heard my thoughts. Leaving the city would be tantamount to declaring it lost.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a moment to compose her answer. How would Father handle this?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The situation has changed since then,” Zelda said after a short pause. “The city is more stable now. And this is not a matter of fleeing for my safety. There have been attempts on my life, and people have died in my service. I cannot abide that. Arlinkar believes this to be the same rogue group as before, and I find his arguments persuasive. If that is the case, then meeting with a legitimate authority within the Gerudo nation would be a natural response. …It’s a diplomatic mission. And we <i>really</i> can’t afford to turn away any offers of aid. Reopening trade routes would give us a great deal more breathing room, if nothing else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>One side of the countess’ lips curled upwards in a grin. “And how is this group any different? How can we trust them? How can you be sure it isn’t this <i>Lynx</i> sending the assassins?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What, and kill her own messenger?” Zelda scowled. “What would that accomplish?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa raised an eyebrow. “It isn’t me you need to convince, Your Grace. Do you expect the common folk to make distinctions between legitimate and rogue groups of traitorous savages?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had a point.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I suppose not,” Zelda said, crossing her legs, lacing her fingers, and running her thumb over the back of Father’s ring. “But does it matter? I can send heralds out to the city in my stead. Have them say I intend to hold those responsible accountable to their actions. Need the message be any more nuanced than that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa smiled, shaking her head. “It’s workable.” She shifted in her seat. “But then, what are you going to do about our mutual <i>friend</i> in your absence?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda narrowed her eyes. “What, Taetus? I’ve already spoken with him. He was too hasty to take action and stepped out of line. But I put him back in his place.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is that what you call it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pardon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nothing, Your Grace,” Lensa said, reaching for her wine again. “Pray tell, what did you say to him, exactly?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda winced, looking away. She hadn’t comported herself well that day. “I… made it very clear that he would be held accountable to his actions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you threaten him?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I might have mentioned something about considering ordering my guard to bring me his head?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa let out a long sigh and took an even longer drought from her glass. “So to summarize: you threatened to behead the man responsible for securing the lives and wellbeing of the common folk of this fair city, for punishing criminals and deigning to use his lawful authority against the arrogant and callous nobility. Is that accurate?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?! That’s not—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, Your Grace, it’s not charitable,” Lensa said, holding up a hand. “But it <i>is</i> accurate, and that is how he will say it. You realize you’ve played directly into his hand?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda ran her fingers through her hair, clasping her hands behind her head. “Okay. But surely he’s not… he wouldn’t…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa finished her glass and handed it to Sera, whispering something in the girl’s ear. “Honestly? I wouldn’t put anything past that man,” she said, sitting forward. “And I wish you had spoken with me before your <i>proclamation</i>. I get the reasoning of it—I do. It’s quite clever. He either saves the realm, or he fails and becomes a convenient scapegoat. But dearie, you’ve essentially given him free reign to pilfer your kingdom in the name of saving it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…So what do you suggest I do now?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, nothing much,” Lensa said, sitting back. “He’s doing a fine job of it—always has—and he’s always going to have the ear of the common folk. They idolize him, and how couldn’t they? He’s truly one of their own. He just needs oversight. That’s all. My advice is to put him on a leash. Establish a tribunal. Nyllara, myself… or others of your choosing.” She waved her hand back and forth. “Leave him to do his thing, but charge us with seeing that he doesn’t overstep. That he doesn’t do anything too unreasonable or without clear precedent. Stability is every bit as important as results.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded to herself. That sounded sensible enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And don’t worry about the heralds, either. I’ll take care of that for you. You focus on what’s important.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Lensa,” Zelda said, feeling relieved. “I appreciate it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My pleasure to serve, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda sat opposite Vestele in the cabin of a small carriage, gazing through the window and out into the fog ahead. What had initially been a request for information on magic and lore turned into an invitation to the Temple of Time, to browse the Order of Sages’ archives of history and vaults of historical artifacts herself. Supposedly there was something <i>very important</i> she needed to see there, though Vestele refused to say what. It had taken significant cajoling to get her to open up, but ultimately she agreed after extracting a few vows.</span>
<br><br>
<span>For her part, Zelda was all nerves, and could barely contain her excitement. It was only a minor diversion from Last Bastion. A day at most. Well, two if you considered the time it took to double back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda had just joined the main group, though they left Castletown a full two hours prior. She, Link, Cove, and two other Sheikah exited via a secret passage in the castle, while another agent of Zelda’s approximate height and build publicly departed with the rest of the retinue via the main gate. The group this time consisted of twenty-six heavily vetted guardsmen, various staff, six Sheikah (including Cove), and one Link.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt somewhat uneasy at enlisting four additional Sheikah—and pulling them away from their previously assigned tasks—but did so at Link’s insistence. To her surprise, the whole ordeal had gone over without event.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele looked up from Zelda’s research notes. Two fingers adjusted her spectacles as she eyed Zelda disapprovingly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er… is there a problem?” Zelda said, fidgeting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The <i>Minish</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blushed. She felt deeply ashamed at the prospect of wasting the High Priestess’ time, or of having Vestele think less of her. “It’s not that I personally believe any of it,” she said quickly, holding up her hands. “It’s just… you know how Fi doesn’t have access to most of her memories? After some prodding, she intimated that she might be able to identify instances similar to her kind of magic, were I to provide her with detailed accountings. I erred on the side of not omitting anything interesting—just in case there was some truth behind any of it. In compiling this list, I included all the more promising myths and legends I knew of, and everything else I could find referenced that wasn’t obviously bunk. I thought this would be a good place to start, but we can just skip it if you don’t think it’s worth the time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele sighed, returning her focus to the journal. Zelda bit at her lip and drummed her fingers anxiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm?” Zelda looked up, eager.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, nothing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh.” She tried to relax, but this was <i>torture</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘The Basilisk’s Gaze,’” Vestele said, tapping the page. “This one’s real.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Really?” Zelda sat up straight. “What do you know of it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not much, unfortunately," Vestele said, frowning. “It’s more than just a common myth, though. There are well-documented reports that have survived since the time of the Lightsworn. The Order calls it ‘Stasis.’ It’s a Red magic, although details of its use have eluded us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. <i>Red magic</i>? “But that doesn’t make any sense. How could it be Red magic?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele set the journal down in her lap and looked up. “Tell me: what do you know of the fragments, and their relation to magic?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shot her a look. “They’re… fragments of Golden Three’s power, right? Artifacts left over from the time of creation. They allow their wielders access to a purer expression of magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele frowned, returning her attention to the journal. “We’ll get there, I suppose. Let me get through this first.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded and went back to anxiously strumming her fingers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Several minutes later, Vestele turned the last page on Zelda’s notes, closing the journal. She set it down beside her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Zelda asked, perhaps too quickly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well. Soulsteel is real, too.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gasped. “No! So the Blin? Are they <i>actually</i> voidspawn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shook her head. “Nothing so simple, I’m afraid. As far as we know, they’re creatures of this world that originate from somewhere far across the sea. Though how they got <i>here</i> is anyone’s guess. You’ve probably noticed they bear a striking resemblance to grubbers?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, but furrowed her brow. “So… bloodrage? Soulsteel? Are they Red magic too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. At least, I don’t think so. They’re …something else.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what would that be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My best guess? Void magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Interesting.” Void magic? Zelda made a note of that, intending to follow up later with Fi. “And how accurate are the accounts?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not even the slightest exaggeration.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shivered. Bloodrage was bad enough. She didn’t even want to imagine what <i>Soulsteel</i> could do. “Seems they’ve forgotten about that one too, then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fortunately enough for us, yes, that does seem to be the case.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda tapped at her chin. “Any other lost magics I should know about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not that I’m aware of.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And the Master Sword?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shook her head. “Can’t say. Something like it might have existed, once. The power to seal away darkness, though? I believe I know what that refers to. There’s an artifact in the vaults that the Seekers originally used to seal away Fae—though its power has long since waned.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, making an additional note. “Anything else stick out?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t be sure,” Vestele said. “There are dozens—hundreds?—of accounts of magical artifacts that defy explanation. Most of them are absurd, though some of them are more or less believable. But which are real, and which are simply stories? The accounts themselves are variable in quality, sparse, and often contradictory. Your guess is as good as mine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pursed her lips. She couldn’t take that for an answer. “Surely the Order has gathered more information than that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, well,” Vestele muttered, shaking her head. “You’d be surprised. There’s clearly <i>something</i> behind all these fanciful tales. Yet not one has ever been substantiated. Well—excepting the fragments, Fae, and a few items related to Fae.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what about the fragments?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The priestess took a moment to stow away her spectacles. She leaned back, looking Zelda over. “I knew you’d ask after that eventually,” she said. “Are you sure you want to know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let me guess,” Zelda said, putting away her notes. “The Golden Three are dead too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Let us hope not, my child,” Vestele said grimly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt the color drain from her face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They left their power with Hylia when they created this realm,” Vestele continued, “You said you thought they allowed access to a purer expression of magic?” She shook her head. “No, Zelda—they <i>are</i> the source of magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda found her eyes drawn to her bracers. She held them up, staring at them in open wonder. “Huh,” was all she could manage to say.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;"><u><b>Zelda’s Research Notes - The Triforce</b></u></div>
<br>
<span>The Triforce is undoubtedly the most powerful artifact in existence, though surprisingly little is known about its true nature. Vestele tells me it was created by the Golden Goddesses themselves, and left to Hylia after their work was complete. The Order of Sages claims it to be the ultimate source of all magic. It is theorized to take the following forms:</span>
<br><br>
<span>1. As a unified whole which—supposedly—would grant the wielder the full power of the Golden Three, and thus the ability to recreate the world according to their heart’s desire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>2. As three “Pieces”: “Wisdom”, “Power”, and “Courage.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>3. As “Fragments” or “Shards”: Each piece can be further divided into nine fragments. Fragments are known to magnify the power of their wielder, or allow them access to lesser abilities related to the powers the three whole pieces bestow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Supposedly each piece or fragment can only be wielded by individuals attuned to their essence. They also have arcane rules governing their possession, and have been known to "seek out" their owners. I do not know precisely what any of this means nor what such entails (and Vestele assures me I am not alone in that), though it does explain certain peculiarities both myself and Link have witnessed.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u><b>Wisdom:</b></u></span>
<br><br>
<span>The embodiment of the powers of Nayru. Grants cosmic powers of divination. Legends say it allows its wielder to see plainly into the future. It was the first piece to be fragmented and lost to time—the event having occurred before the era of the Old Kingdom. When fragmented, each shard grants lesser abilities related to divination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>1. Wielder gains the ability to scry the location of closely bonded individuals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>2. The wielder may sometimes have prophetic dreams. The dreams are often highly symbolic or metaphorical, and are open to interpretation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>3. Wielder gains the ability to communicate telepathically with closely bonded individuals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>4. Wielder may scry at any recently visited location.</span>
<br><br>
<span>5. Prophetic dreams are more clearly defined.</span>
<br><br>
<span>6-9: ???</span>
<br><br>
<span><u><b>Power:</b></u></span>
<br><br>
<span>The embodiment of the powers of Din. Grants tremendous strength and endurance, and significantly heightens magical affinity. It was also fragmented well before the current historical record, with countless wars being fought over possession of its fragments. Each fragment considerably boosts the physical and magical prowess of its wielder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With some number of fragments, supposedly the wielder gains access to an ability similar to “Stasis” (i.e. - The Basilisk’s Gaze). Nothing further is known at present. It is hypothesized that several fragments (or perhaps the full piece) may confer abilities related to Siphon and Transformation.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u><b>Courage:</b></u></span>
<br><br>
<span>The embodiment of the powers of Farore. This one is the least known, even though supposedly a whole piece was wielded as recently as the time of the Hero’s Stand. The fragments are said to grant "luck," which the wielder experiences as preternatural reflexes and instincts that border on premonition.</span>
<br><br>
<span><u><b>Other Notes:</b></u></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link possesses one fragment of Courage, I possess three of Wisdom, and Vesyrn (previously Father) possesses one of Power. Nineve of the Zora possesses one of Wisdom. The Gorons possess one of Power. As mentioned elsewhere in my writings, knowledge of the other fragments’ locations have been lost to time. </span>
<br><br>
<span>Are there additional blue and green magics we don’t know about?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Could the fragments of Power be the force behind the Warlords?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>With eager anticipation, Zelda followed the High Priestess as they descended down a flight of stairs and into a dark, narrow corridor. A dozen robed monks with tattooed faces trailed behind. They walked in pairs, though perhaps four could stand abreast in the hallway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A short jaunt down the hall, and they came to a halt before a massive iron vault. What secrets lie hidden inside?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele turned to Zelda, handing her a torch. Zelda took it, and Vestele approached the vault. She inserted a long, oddly shaped key into a locking mechanism, then stepped back. Two burly men stepped forward and, with a great deal of effort, spun the contraption a quarter turn counter-clockwise. A loud <b>click</b> reverberated through the hall, and the door swung outward with a protesting creak.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“After you,” Vestele said, motioning.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stepped through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Instantly, her breath caught with a gasp. Inside was the most beautiful creature she had ever laid eyes upon. A young woman hung suspended in the air above a stone dais. Frozen; hovering in a beam of light. Her skin radiated a soft white glow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Her name is Niesis," Vestele said, stepping up beside Zelda. Behind them, the monks fanned out to surround the dais.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda couldn’t take her eyes away from the woman. Was <i>this</i> what a Fae looked like? “How…?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At her side, Vestele offered up a simple scepter. Zelda tore her eyes away from Niesis, taking the item and handing back the torch. It felt cold to the touch; a three-foot long metal rod with a prismatic opal encased in silver at the end.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This is the artifact the Seekers originally used to seal away the Fae,” Vestele said. “Niesis created it and instructed them in its use, though it’s power has long since faded. She aided them in locating the other Fae, then submitted herself willingly to imprisonment.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda studied the item, pushing a tiny amount of her own magic into it. Just as Vestele said, she did not sense any energies stored in the scepter. “Can it be recharged?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As most knew, ordinary items could be made substantially better by being imbued with magic. A sword would become sharper and take longer to dull, a pen would take longer to run dry, and a torch would burn brighter and longer with a steadier flame. Although Zelda expected the actual truth of the scepter to be more complicated, perhaps the simplest hypothesis was just that it once held a great deal of magic, and that magic had faded over time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele shook her head. "I don’t believe so. It may be possible, but all knowledge of that sort was destroyed long ago. That isn’t to say we haven’t tried. But simply Imbuing it doesn’t work, nor does leaving it in proximity to fragments. Nor does having a wielder of the fragments imbue it. Believe it or not, we have tried all the obvious ideas.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned, turning her attention back to the beautiful young woman suspended in the beam of light. Something didn’t add up. “You said she submitted herself willingly to imprisonment,” she said. “Why would she do that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your guess is as good as mine,” Vestele replied. “Perhaps she knew the threat she and others of her kind posed? As I said, not all Fae were as horrible as Cyrae.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But that doesn’t make sense either,” Zelda said. “I get sealing away the malicious ones. But why would Niesis want herself to be imprisoned too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who’s to say?” Vestele responded. “I’ve pondered it myself. It might not have been her choice? That’s the only explanation I’ve come up with. Perhaps there was some other danger the Fae posed? Or perhaps our predecessors simply viewed them as a threat to the long-term stability of our kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda held the scepter out in front of her, examining the opal again. On further inspection, she couldn’t help but notice the strikingly unique array of colors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Everyone,” she called, looking out over the room. “I’m going to summon the Emissary of the Holy Mother. Do not be alarmed.” She watched with slight amusement as the monks exchanged glances and murmured amongst themselves. She looked to Vestele. The priestess shrugged uncertainly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“When you’re ready, Fi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Mistress,” Fi said, materializing from the shadows before her not a second later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele spoke up, looking concerned. “Your Grace—if I may ask, what is it you intend?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated. She was hoping she wouldn’t encounter resistance here. She looked to Niesis, then to Fi, and then back to Vestele. “If my idea works… I intend to temporarily release the Fae, and see if she can answer some questions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t believe that’s wise,” Vestele said quickly. “Perhaps—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Vestele,” Zelda said firmly, putting all the authority she could muster into her voice. “You said she willingly submitted to imprisonment before. What are you worried about? We’ll just seal her again when we’re done.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vestele frowned, looking anxious. “I… don’t know, to be honest,” she said. “I don’t have any definitive concerns. It’s just… Fae should not be underestimated, Your Grace. They were sealed away and imprisoned for a reason.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda met the priestess’ eyes and took a moment to compose her thoughts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what if that reason was a poor one?” she asked. “What if our ancestors were only acting out of irrational fear? What if Niesis can provide us with <i>invaluable</i> historical and magical knowledge? Knowledge that could prove decisive in combating the Blin? Unearthing hidden secrets? <i>Ending the Blights?</i> Vestele—think about it! There are twelve powerful, trained mages in the room—thirteen if you count myself. Fi can also assist in restoring our magic if need be. I think it’s worth the risk.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The priestess considered. She looked to Niesis, then back to Zelda. With a sigh, she withdrew. “As you will,” she said. “I won’t stand in your way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She would be lying if she said Vestele’s reservations did not also give her pause. But something about this… something about seeing Niesis imprisoned like that? It felt wrong. If there was even the slightest chance…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi? Can you transfer some of your power into the scepter?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I may attempt to do so, if you wish for me to proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do it,” Zelda said, decisively.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi straightened up, looking to the heavens with her absence-of-arms outstretched. Chromatic vapors swirled around her, ebbing and flowing outward from her being. Zelda held up the scepter, and wisps of vapor poured into it. A few seconds later, and the opal pulsed with a faint glow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s working!” Zelda exclaimed. She couldn’t believe it. It was actually working!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi relaxed, and the energies abated. The opal faded just as quickly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No! No, no, no! <i>Damnation!</i>” Zelda cursed. She felt the opal. It was warmer now, though just as dull as before. She tried pushing her own magic into it, and it resisted. “Fi, how much power did you use?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Approximately ten percent of my budgeted reserves.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Again,” Zelda commanded. “Use three quarters of the remainder. We’ll take a break before moving on to Last Bastion if necessary.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you wish, Mistress,” Fi said. She drew tall again, and the energies swirled. Zelda held the scepter outstretched. She waited anxiously as chromatic vapors flooded into the orb. Its glow returned; intensified. Almost a minute passed before Fi stopped again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Belatedly, Zelda realized she didn’t actually know how to use the scepter. <i>Fick, fick, fick!</i> Thinking quickly, she rushed over to Niesis, rod extended. Instantly, the opal shattered and a shockwave of energy threw her back. She hit her head and blacked out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>From nowhere, a voice spoke.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The Void.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perfect stillness. Absolute emptiness. Unchanging. Forever. Eternal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Infinite.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Before there was time, before there was space, before there <i>Was</i>, there was the Void.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Void was all, and the Void was nothing. But how could <i>Nothing</i> be?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The first thought, spoken eons before life—eons before history and outside of time—was one of <i>Division</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And so it was that from <i>Nothing</i> came <i>Creation</i>. And with it…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Destruction</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Two halves of <i>Nothing</i>. Equal and opposite; a paradox and its own resolution; able to exist only because their sum total was still, precisely, <i>Nothing</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>My mind awoke.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Adrift in a sea of stars, I had no focus and no bearing. Before me lay an expanse that I somehow recognized as the whole of the cosmos, stretching from infinity at one end and receding into infinity at the other.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In that expanse, the three layers of reality stood juxtaposed; <i>Divinity</i>, <i>Concept</i>, and <i>Substance</i>. Each a reflection of the others, each flowing, twisting and turning in complex fractal shapes at the borders. I gazed upon the center where all things met, and with a start, I realized something there gazed back at me.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ageless eons passed in a single ephemeral moment, and I saw how all things were connected, how all things were, and how all manner of things could come to be. In that moment, I <i>knew</i> eternity. I was understanding, and I was perception. I became knowledge. I became <i>Wisdom</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Above me, two brilliant red flames came alight. Entranced, I watched the fires intensify. They grew rapidly, at a frightening pace. Swirling, they came at me. Faster and faster, hotter and brighter, until their radiance outshone all else. I tried to brace myself against the coming shockwave, but before I could react, I was torn apart and engulfed by a heat hotter than any sun.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The whole of my being burst into a raging inferno, wreathed in black flames; a white-hot sphere of condensed fury at its center. Eternal and all-consuming, I burned with raw, crackling energy; <i>will</i> concentrated to the densest substance. I became one with that fire, and it was one with me. It energized me, and drove me to seek perfection. This fire was strength, and it was unity. It was passion and desire; ardor and determination. Raw. Overwhelming. <i>Power</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The flames abated, and an off-white crystalline structure materialized around me. Bones and sinew interwove intricately, a biological scaffolding of bewildering complexity. Muscle fibers stitched together, organs and regulatory systems grew and connected inside, and layers of delicate tan skin folded around it all. My vision retreated to two conical sections emanating from a central locus. The ethereal plane of the divine fell out of my perception, just as the plane of concept became sharper and more focused. I felt a pulsing in my chest and in my ears, and knew that I was <i>alive</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was a sensation unlike any other. Overwhelmed with emotion, I laughed, and then cried out in shock. With this new form came a mind, and in that mind vast streams of knowledge bent and eddied with the current of my thoughts. But I had not the time to reflect, as the world around me continued to shift. Euphoria and wonder swelled inside my chest as a beautiful green-blue sphere rose from below, expanding to encompass my view.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was only then that I realized I was falling, and felt a pang of terror. But just as quickly the fear subsided, replaced by a serenity bequeathed by assurances whispered on the winds. Of course, I could not be harmed. This realm and its physical laws were little more than humble suggestions next to my own divine will. Emboldened by <i>Courage</i>, I threw myself at the sky, and flew.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wind screamed in my ears as I streaked through the clouds. Below, rivers crisscrossed into lakes and estuaries before meeting with a vast ocean expanding in all directions. I watched as mountains jutted out, defiantly presenting their peaks to the sky. Verdant hills came into focus, rising and undulating across the landscape. And with a deafening <b>crack</b>, I slammed into the ground, screaming my elation to the heavens for all the world to hear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Rising from the small crater left by my descent, my feet brushed lightly against the dew-wet grass. I delighted to feel the softness of its blades between my toes and the coarse earth beneath my feet. With a raised hand I met the sun’s resplendent caress, just as a cool breeze whipped about, tossing my hair and bringing with it scents of charred earth and stone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Belatedly, the realization struck: I was not alone. I turned sharply to see three majestic feminine silhouettes towering above me. An instant of recognition, and I fell to my knees in reverence of their divine glory. I knew they had been with me this whole time. They’d moulded me; shaped me from the Void itself. They were my mothers, my creators, my progenitors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nayru, Goddess of Wisdom. Din, Goddess of Power. And Farore, Goddess of Courage.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda came to in the arms of one of the monks, with Vestele kneeling at her side. The priestess was saying something, but she couldn’t make out the words. Zelda held a hand to her forehead, trying to gather her bearings.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked over to the dais, but Niesis was nowhere to be found.</span>
<br><br>
