<span>Ari’s heart hammered against his ribs as Kith’raxis—the dread god of the Gekkar—plodded towards them in the dim crimson glow, its massive form a nightmare of jagged spikes and molten stone flowing beneath obsidian scales. Eyes like burning coals fixed on their groggy, battered, and weaponless group with an eerie, malign intelligence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Courage blazed to life in Ari’s chest, and with it came a voice. An ancient, primal battle cry reverberated throughout his being, as if sung to him by the goddess Nenore herself: <i>Go now, my child. Fight. Stand brave against the darkness.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>His vision narrowed to a single, burning imperative—this beast would not touch the others. Not if he had anything to say about it. Magic ignited in his veins as he surged forward, heedless of weapons or strategy and caring not for the impossible odds.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari, no!” Ryn’s voice called behind him, but divine anger had already banished all caution and fear from his mind, save for one thought: <i>protect them</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He charged across the bone-littered ground, his magic accelerating his steps as he sprinted toward the beast. Roughly halfway across, he spotted the glint of steel—a half-broken sword clutched in the skeletal grip of some long-dead sacrifice. Without breaking stride, he dropped into a slide, his momentum carrying him across the slick stone as he wrenched the blade free from bony fingers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The weapon was crude, with its edge chipped and its tang cracked—but it was <i>something</i>. Ari rolled back to his feet, the broken sword raised as Kith’raxis reared back. Time slowed to a crawl. He set his feet and prepared to close and strike—just as its massive tail whipped around in a blur of motion. Despite his quickened senses and magically-heightened reflexes, the spiny, flaming appendage uncoiled like the cracking of a whip, faster than he could react. He tried to leap—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The impact lifted him off his feet and sent him skidding across the cavern floor to slam against a rock. Pain shot through his body as he felt something crack. His vision swam as he fought to rise from the ground, and he struggled to catch his breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari!” Gazra roared as he charged to join the fray, his bestial form rippling with raw power. Behind him, Grenja and Jedal also rushed to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kith’raxis inhaled, its chest swelling with volcanic fire.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s blood turned to ice. He could see the glow building in the creature’s chest and throat, could feel the superheated air beginning to shimmer. “Get back,” he rasped, struggling to get the words out through his battered chest. “GET BACK!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The cone of flame erupted from the beast’s maw, washing over all three men. Ari could do nothing but watch helplessly as Gazra’s bestial form was immolated mid-charge, his agonized bellow cutting through the roar of flames. Grenja’s panicked screams lasted mere seconds before the fire consumed him, while Jedal collapsed and fell to his knees in deafening silence, his body a blackened husk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The stench of burning flesh filled Ari’s nostrils. The sound of their dying and the frantic calls of the rest of the party echoed in the cavern as the flames guttered out, leaving only charred bones and armor. He grasped at the dirt, pulse pounding with helpless rage.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari bid his uncooperative body to rise, his muscles screaming in protest. He staggered to his feet, the broken sword still clutched in hand. The others were shouting, trying to regroup, but all he could see was the massive form of Kith’raxis looming before him, scaly hide shot through with molten veins that pulsed with a sickening light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He staggered forward, the broken sword raised as high as his battered and bruised body would allow. Kith’raxis turned back toward him, its cavernous jaw opening wide. Rows upon rows of serrated teeth gleamed in the hellish light as it lunged—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Agony beyond description screamed through every fiber of his body as those horrible fangs clamped down on his chest. The sound of his own bones splintering. The wet tearing as claws raked across his flesh. He slipped into darkness as Kith’raxis rent his body asunder.</span>
