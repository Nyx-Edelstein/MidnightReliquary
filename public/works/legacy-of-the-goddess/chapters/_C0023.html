    <span><b><u>Zelda’s Journal - Diary of Dreams</u></b></span>
</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>1st of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I saw the same young man in the woods from my previous dream. Or at least, I assume that to be the case. I can’t ever be certain with these things. He wore similar clothing and held a strange instrument, playing a melody atop a fallen tree in the middle of a clearing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I can’t quite recall the melody, but in the dream I had the oddest sense that the music was calling to me. Beckoning me to draw near. As I approached, the man took off into the forest, and I followed. He continued to play as I pursued, leading me deeper and deeper into the woods until I stirred myself awake.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>6th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>This was an odd one that I initially dismissed as unimportant. After my falling out with Lensa, I dreamt that I awoke in my bed at the inn, unable to sleep. I then decided to get dressed and take a walk outside to clear my mind. However, upon leaving the room I found myself standing on an open road in the middle of the night. There was no moon overhead, but somehow I could still see.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As I took in my surroundings, I heard a noise nearby and turned to see a figure watching me from behind a tree. I didn’t recognize them at first, but the tall figure and red hair made me think of Shesan. I called out to her, but she ducked away out of my sight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I was then awoken by Laylith. She said she was concerned for me as I was mumbling and tossing fitfully in my sleep. I thanked her for her concern, but asked kindly that she not wake me in the future. Who knows what importance my dreams may hold?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Earlier that day…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Idly, Taetus paced along the floor of the small chamber. It was still dark out; another three hours or so until dawn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tea, Counselor?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“None for me, Lord Sheikah, thank you,” Taetus said, observing the proper formalities. Truly, he despised that epithet above all others. <i>Lord</i> Sheikah? <i>Lady</i> Sheikah? What exactly were they lords and ladies <i>of</i>? He shook his head, putting the thought from his mind. He had to remind himself from time to time that it was merely another game to be had. Far be it for him—the wealthiest and most accomplished man in the kingdom—to question his place in society.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well,” Malg said with a shrug as he poured himself a steaming cup. “And you, Ma’am?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan,” Shesan said listlessly, not bothering to turn away from the window. “Just Shesan,” she said. “And no, thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg gave another shrug. “Just as well.” He stifled a yawn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Such an intriguing woman, Shesan. A traveler from another world? <i>Fascinating.</i> Taetus didn’t even know where to begin. He only wished that they could have met under more ideal circumstances. But then again, would they have met under other circumstances? Likely not.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He still hadn’t figured her out—which was unsettling to be sure: wildcards were the eternal bane of his existence. Still, one could only ever play the hand they were dealt. Malevolent goddess-killing entities devouring the world? Cursed pigmen wielding unholy weapons of nightmare and destruction? No matter! They would just have to…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Hrm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus clicked his tongue against his teeth and strummed his fingers behind his back. No; he had to be honest with himself. This was a rather prickly situation—one he wasn’t <i>entirely</i> sure he could finagle his way out of. He wasn’t ever thrilled to have to rely on the plans of others, but—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nervous, Counselor?” Malg asked. Taetus turned to see the man reclining casually in his chair, one leg folded over the other. He raised an eyebrow as he sipped his tea.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg: a refined gentleman of a Sheikah—or so he wanted the rest of the world to believe. Taetus kept tabs on all their lot as a matter of course, and so knew precisely what variety of monster this man was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…And here, he was presented with a challenge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He could never resist a good challenge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not at all, Lord Sheikah,” Taetus said. “Restless, perhaps. I think best on my feet.” One… Two… Three… He tilted his head. “I don’t believe we’ve been formally introduced. Forgive my impudence, but it was <i>Malg</i>, right? The same Malg from the Battle of South Haven?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>And now time for… <i>Absolute Cool!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The world slowed down around him. He couldn’t keep it up for long, but the briefest of moments was all he needed. A twinkling of the eye and the beginnings of a smile. Malg caught himself, then turned his head fractionally and narrowed his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Apologies,” Taetus said, feigning humility. He turned away and pursed his lips. “It’s just… well, my cousin served at Last Bastion during the skirmishes.” Second cousin, once removed. “I’ve heard so many stories.” Not stories from <i>him</i> about <i>you</i>, necessarily. Just stories.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh? Infantry, I presume? Or…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Logistics officer to Lieutenant Bartholomew,” Taetus said. Not <i>First Lieutenant</i> Bartholomew—just some other random fellow who happened to share the same name. One… Two… Three… Four… “Sadly, he passed shortly after the siege.” From a heart attack in his home near Kakariko, at the age of one hundred and three.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg set down his cup and stood, then extended his hand. Taetus shook it firmly. “Thank you for yours and your family’s service, Counselor,” Malg said. “Our kingdom is better for men like you. Goddess willing, we may yet pull through this mess.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine, Lord Sheikah,” Taetus said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please—Sir Malg.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine, Sir Malg,” Taetus repeated. He grinned, then nodded cordially as Malg returned to his seat. He—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan caught Taetus’ eye. The faintest of smiles as she shook her head and turned back to the window. His mind blanked. Fascinating? No—this woman was <i>terrifying</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Definitely need to keep an eye on that one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I must say, I’m—” Malg interrupted himself with a yawn. “Excuse me. Impressed. I’m rather impressed with your work here in the capital, Counselor.” A shake of the head and another sip of tea. “Marvelous work. Let’s hope it hasn’t been for naught, hmm?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am humbled by your kind words,” Taetus said, tearing his eyes away from Shesan. “Truthfully, I’ve done very little in the way of actual work. As ever, the people of this city know how best to help themselves. They need only a keen eye to chart the course—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—and a firm hand to keep them on the path,” Malg finished with a smile and a nod. “King Gaillard’s words.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed.” Taetus toyed with the ring on his finger. “Goddess rest his soul.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goddess rest his soul,” Malg repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Behind them, the doors to the council chamber swung open. Taetus turned to see the Queen enter with her guard dogs in tow. <i>Finally.</i> Knowing her, she had made a detour to the apothecary. Goddesses forbid she show up sober to an emergency strategy meeting when the fate of the kingdom was at stake.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda and Laylith strode over to the table while Cove and Gazra stopped at the door. Taetus bowed low. He waited until she and the others were seated before joining them at the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. Let’s get started,” Zelda said. “First thing’s first. Uhm. Hmm… I guess I could…” She stared blankly at the far wall and rubbed her eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tea, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, yes, please. Thank you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg poured her a cup as Laylith leaned over to whisper something in her ear. Shesan caught Taetus’ eye again. What <i>was</i> that woman thinking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right. So,” Zelda said. “Preliminary estimates put it at about ninety-thousand soulsteel-wielding Blin. Mostly Bulblin, Moblin. Reports have it that nearly all of the smaller ones failed to survive the ritual. Our forces are spread way too thin and the main army is in full retreat—forced march, with the Blin hot on their heels. To absolutely no one’s surprise, they’re not stopping to pillage. I won’t mince words; it’s not looking good for us. But, hey, what else is new?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She downed her tea and set the cup aside. A grim silence settled over the table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve just spoken with Arlinkar via Fi,” Zelda continued. “He and his team will be continuing on with their mission at first light.” She glanced briefly to Shesan, then to Taetus and Malg. “Sorry. How much have you two been read in on? About the triforce fragments, and all that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus and Malg exchanged glances.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Besides that we are on the hunt to procure the fragments before the enemy?” Malg ventured.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “There are a few leads we are following up on. Arlinkar is chasing down a fragment of Courage, while Golvara and Vesyrn are tracking down—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Excuse me, Your Grace. <i>Vesyrn?</i>” Taetus asked incredulously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Long story.” Zelda sighed. “Not one I want to get into right now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe what she means to say is that Vesyrn is not aligned with the enemy,” Shesan said. “He is, in fact, one of my agents. And while I deeply regret—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Not. Now. Shesan,” Zelda said bitterly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan frowned. Taetus carefully studied the both of them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Mmm. The pieces were finally starting to click into place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At any rate,” Shesan said, “Golvara is a prominent figure amongst the Zora—one whom I have been working closely with. Following the Ja’bu incident, Nineve’s fragment was lost. He is… as per my most recent intel, currently deep within corrupted Zora territory.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus noted the brief pause. That was uncharacteristic of her—at least from what he had seen. What information was she hiding?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As per our arrangement,” Shesan turned again to Zelda, “a team of Sheikah has been sent to aid in his extraction. Similar for Vesyrn, who is, on my orders, tracking down rumors of additional fragments of Wisdom in the Old Kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As for Power,” Zelda said. “Only four fragments remain out of Ganondorf’s control. Taetus, you now hold one—previously belonging to my father.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nodded solemnly. He had not asked for that particular responsibility, but then again he was not in the habit of refusing service to his kingdom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We have also sent an emissary to treat with the Gorons,” Zelda said. “It is my hope that we can convince them to put aside our past differences and work together. Although—again—we have heard no word back as of yet. As for the other two…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus frowned, leaning forward against the table. “Apologies, Your Grace, but what does any of this have to do with the coming siege?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hesitated. Shesan cut in. “The Blin having rediscovered Soulsteel is yet another distraction,” she said. “The same as Ja’bu and the same as the Blight. Effective distractions, mind you, but distractions nonetheless. The enemy seeks to tie up our resources and force us to commit to the defense while Ganondorf and his minions continue to work from the shadows. This is not Demise’s final play, and there will be more to come. Above all, it is <i>imperative</i> we keep in mind this fact as we decide on our next course of action.” She turned to glare pointedly at Zelda.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…About that,” Zelda ventured. “I think that perhaps this situation—as bleak as it seems—may provide us with an opportunity.” She paused, casting her eyes around the table. “I had another dream just earlier. A Blin shaman calling himself <i>Ildram</i> contacted me, claiming to hold another fragment of Wisdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The same individual from your previous dreams?” Shesan asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “I believe so. And I feel compelled to take him at his word on that, given that he was successful in contacting me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus raised a finger. “Sorry. Previous dreams…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Zelda said. “From the fragments of Wisdom I carry. From time to time I have… <i>vaguely</i> prophetic dreams. Rarely do they make much sense, except in hindsight. I have thrice dreamt of finding myself in a grassy field that was the site of some ritual. In the first dream, I was surrounded by chanting Blin. In the second, it was just Ildram, and the last… This one was unlike the others. It was more vivid, and he spoke to me directly—well, as best he could. I guess smart Blin are still Blin.” She laughed uneasily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anyway, I got the impression that there was a schism within Blin society, insofar as that is a thing. Ildram repeated several times that he was forced against his will by the Mokoblin—one of the Warlords—to learn and teach the secrets of soulsteel to the other Blin. I think he’s been trying to warn me of that fact.” She sighed. “Too late, it seems. But most pertinently, he told me that Ganondorf had given the Warlords fragments of Power.” She turned to her side. “I thought that was impossible, <i>Shesan?”</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is,” Shesan said confidently. “You are mistaken.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gawked at her. “I’m sorry, what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not possible. As simple as that.” She spread out her hands. “Ildram had to have been referring to something else. You said he struggled to communicate with you. What <i>exactly</i> did he say?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda furrowed her brow, taking a moment to ponder. “He said the Mokoblin held <i>strength</i>. ‘Strength from Great-one.’ And that the ‘Great one’ held a greater strength, bestowed to him by the ‘Old God’. If that isn’t him trying to say that Demise had Ganondorf give the Warlords fragments of Power—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No,” Shesan reaffirmed. “It has to be something else. Some other magic, a cultural misunderstanding, or else an error in translation. Unless you have somehow hidden the fact from me, the two slain Warlords were not in possession of fragments of Power. However, my intel says they <i>were</i>, prior to the Blight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda mumbled a curse under her breath. “Okay, sure. The first Warlord definitely did not hold a fragment—or else surely Hylia would have done something with it. However; the second or third still might. For all we know, some random soldier or Blin could be in possession of a shard right now. In fact, I don’t believe Wymar and the others even know what to look for.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Highly unlikely,” Shesan countered. “And in my opinion, not worth wasting time on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda crossed her arms. “Then do you have a better explanation for what ‘strength’ Demise gave to Ganondorf to give to the Warlords? Something less vague than ‘some other magic?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I don’t,” Shesan said. “However, it sounds to me like this is referring to a <i>past</i> event. As in, before or concurrent to Ja’bu, and quite possibly before the Blight. Given that, and also based on the war reports, I would wager it isn’t anything game-changing. Whatever it is, it <i>may</i> give us marginally more insight into defeating the final Warlord, but aside from that?” She shrugged. “Irrelevant. Perhaps once we’ve handled more immediate concerns we can attempt to make contact with Ildram again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah, an opening. Taetus cleared his throat. “Excuse me. If I may?” He looked between the two women, and did not register an objection.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I hate to state the obvious, but from the report that was read to us, it seemed to me as if the Lord General is planning on marching the army back <i>here.</i> To Castletown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nods all around. Taetus blinked and shifted uncomfortably.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem. Well then. In my estimation, speaking, of course, as the preeminent authority on the matter… Castletown is not prepared for a second siege. What’s more, we lack the manpower to set up defenses in the…” He looked to Zelda, Shesan, and then back again. “Week? Two weeks we have before the army arrives?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh dear sweet Hylia, Holy Mother Above. “Your Grace, do we have a plan?” he asked frankly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A long silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a breath. “The scroll that was delivered along with the message… It contains orders from Lord General. Plans that were laid out in advance for just such an eventuality. Not with regard to <i>soulsteel</i>, just the possibility of another siege.” She gestured to Malg.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg gave a nod, then turned to Taetus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Counselor: our orders are to trap the city in advance of the coming assault. We will have assistance from staged reinforcements from the southern contingents in the coming days, as well as from outriders sent ahead of the main army. The Blin will be lured inside the walls, where we hope to destroy them from within by setting the city ablaze.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>No. Surely…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus looked around. All eyes were on him, yet no one spoke. He found himself gaping and shut his mouth. He felt his heart in his ears, but did his best to remain calm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He licked his lips. “And… ah, what of the <i>citizens</i> of Castletown?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Mother’s mercy,</i> Taetus, what the fick?! Of course we’re going to evacuate first!” Zelda grumbled under her breath and turned away as Laylith set a hand on her shoulder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus breathed a sigh of relief and took a moment to compose himself. “Forgive me, Your Grace. I only—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—No, no,” Zelda said, waving a hand. “We’re all tired. I overreacted. Look: I’m not exactly sold on the plan either, but I’m also not one to question Wymar on strategy. If we’re truly this desperate, then I don’t see that we have any other choice than to prepare as directed. Still… I might have an alternative.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan raised a pointed eyebrow. “Oh?” the strange woman asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus folded his hands in his lap. He knew exactly what that meant. Inwardly, he braced himself for yet another brilliantly foolish idea that overlooked some glaring flaw, as if sheer ingenuity could make up the deficit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I want to mark Captain Izu and have Fi overload him on magic while he challenges the final Warlord to a duel,” Zelda said. “From what I’ve been told, he might be our best shot, given Arlinkar is a kingdom-and-a-half away.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah, there it was—just not quite as <i>brilliant</i> as expected. Only the Queen, and she alone, were capable of such imaginative idiocy. Taetus leaned forward, affecting an expression of only mild concern. “I’m sorry, Your Grace—a duel?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She smirked at him. He didn’t like that smirk. That smirk never meant anything good.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A duel, yes,” she said confidently. “Single combat. <i>Gugwayah</i>, I believe they call it. You see,” she turned to Laylith and then back to him. “Arlinkar found several books back at the Obsidian Spire. They were written in a language I believe to be…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus raised a finger. Zelda sighed. “Yes? What is—oh. The Obsidian Spire?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh. Sorry. Uhm…” Zelda tapped her chin. “It’s a not-actually-cursed binding site of <i>yet another</i> ancient evil Voidspawn terrible god-thingy, that also just so happened to double as a Lightsworn training ground. Link saw the location in his vision after, well, becoming a Lightsworn.” She held up a hand, preempting Shesan’s objection. “Sort of. It’s complicated. But yeah, he’s at least <i>on the path to becoming</i> a Lightsworn now.” A sideways glance to Shesan. “Not sure if I told you that yet. Oh, and don’t worry—Morudo Geira is very dead. Ganondorf killed her like a decade ago or something—that’s how he became the High King of the Gerudo. Anyway… uhm… Spire, right. So Link and a team of Sheikah sought out the location with help of the Sunseekers, shortly after we met with Shesan. He then completed the trials there, gained the blessing of Hylia, <i>found some books!</i> And, uh… wait, where was I?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus gaped in sheer bewilderment. “He gained the blessing of—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Not <i>Hylia</i>, exactly,” Shesan corrected. “Only a shadow. An echo. A remnant.” She waved a hand. “It’s unimportant.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Dubious. Taetus nodded anyway. “Very well. You were saying, Your Grace? Books?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, yes—books! Link and the others couldn’t read them of course—I think they might have been written in some precursor to both Hylian and Gerudo? At any rate, Fi was able to translate. One of them—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I’m sorry, but that sounds like an <i>exceedingly</i> important detail to have left out,” Shesan said irritably. “When were you planning on telling me this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda huffed. “Um, now? It happened <i>literally yesterday</i>, Shesan. Fi went over the books with Link while they were waiting for me to decide whether or not to mark Taetus, then later I got her to recite some of it to me and stayed up late transcribing the highlights. At some point I fell asleep and was contacted by Ildram, then <i>someone</i> woke me up before I could get more information from him, and then…” She cleared her throat. “And now we’re here. Questions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan let out a sigh, then stood and paced over to the window.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Most intriguing.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace,” Taetus said again, tearing his attention away. “What was it in these books Arlinkar found?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, right. One of them held the account of a Lightsworn master named Zobor. Supposedly he once stopped a Blight before it began by seeking out their Warlord and loudly challenging him to a duel in front of his subordinates. I am given to understand that in Blin culture, such a challenge cannot be refused.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And are you sure this account was from <i>primary sources</i>, rather than more <i>cultural references</i>?” Shesan asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blushed. “Well… admittedly, the editor of the book stated that the veracity of some details were disputed.” She glanced over her shoulder. “Before you say anything, I know how that sounds. Master Zobor did come off to me as a bit of a braggart, but can’t imagine he spun up the whole tale, especially given his standing within the Lightsworn order. We’re not <i>certain</i>—Link is, understandably, fuzzy on the details—but I believe that’s also how High Captain Raolin managed to save him from certain death at the hands of the Warlord during the siege.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus rubbed his temple. This was a lot of information to take in all at once. He might have to take notes later to make sure nothing slipped by.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Where to start?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This sounds promising, Your Grace,” he said. He turned halfway towards Malg and adopted a frown. “I can’t say I am much abreast of military strategy, but I have to wonder… given the High Captain’s intervention, is this matter of unrefusable honor duels common knowledge?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg began to reply, but it was Laylith who spoke first. “That depends on what you mean by ‘common knowledge,’” she said guardedly. “It isn’t exactly a closely guarded secret, but it also isn’t one that’s widely shared—for good reason. The life expectancy of young boys with dreams of grandeur and an eagerness to prove themselves tends to diminish somewhat after learning the fact. Not to mention the difficulties in maintaining formation and enforcing doctrine. The Blin almost always outnumber us, and our advantage in the field has always been in our superior organization and tactics. Needless to say, that advantage disappears if every other would-be hero breaks rank to save their fellows at the first opportunity.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm,” Taetus said noncommittally. “So, would you say it’s safe to assume the <i>Lord General</i> is aware of this particularity?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh yes, of course,” Malg said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus watched in lamentable resignation as the Queen visibly withered, setting her head on the table. He looked between Laylith and Malg, and…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two had locked gazes, as if engaged in a battle of wills. That was <i>most</i> odd. Had Laylith somehow offended Malg’s sensibilities with her interjection? Taetus was unaware of any rank relation between them. If anything, Laylith had seniority here. And to his surprise, it was <i>she</i> who broke first. She tilted her head, eyes settling on her lap.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah, how <i>interesting!</i> Of course. That dynamic only made sense. Like a moth drawn to the flame…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed,” Malg said, picking up where he left off. “It’s certainly not a bad idea, Your Grace. That is in fact how the second Warlord was defeated—following roughly a month of strategic maneuvering to set up for a final, decisive, Sheikah-led operation. Yes… a strong, skilled champion with an excess of magic…?” He rubbed his chin. “That may well give us the edge we need.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised her head. “Really? You think so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Malg gave a single deep nod. “I’m certain the Lord General has his own picks, but in my humble opinion, Guard Captain Izu would make a fine choice. A veteran soldier, competent Blue mage, and nigh-unrivaled swordsman? Who better? Why, it’s practically ideal. No doubt he would be honored to give his life for the kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, then did a double take. “I’m sorry, come again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s a suicide mission,” Shesan said tactlessly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room went still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Zelda said after a moment. “…Well, we still have time. I’m sure we can think of—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Even <i>if</i> they succeed in getting anywhere near the Warlord, and even if they succeed in killing him, there will still be hundreds if not thousands of Moblin wielding soulsteel between them and any reinforcements. By no means should you let that dissuade you, Zelda—but for heavens’ sake, girl, grow a spine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room went deathly quiet again. Taetus kept himself out of it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was Malg who broke the silence. “You shouldn’t be upset, Your Grace,” he said. “It’s a fine plan, and with work it may have decent odds of success. It’s undoubtedly worth trying, and someone has to do it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please, Malg, that’s not helping,” Laylith said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, he’s right,” Zelda said, sounding distant. She stared blankly at the far wall. “Do we know where Izu is presently? Last I checked, he was escorting the Sunseekers. How quickly can we reach him?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith and Malg locked eyes again. A flash of blue—another, and again. Malg scoffed, then stood and stepped away from the table and over towards the Sheikah guardsmen by the door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Three or four days, I think?” Laylith said softly. “Plenty of time. But it doesn’t have to be <i>him</i>, you know. There are plenty of other—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I don’t need to be coddled, Laylith,” Zelda said coldly. “If he’s the best one for the job, then…” She took a sharp breath. “I have to ask him, at least. I’ll leave it to him to decide.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>As if any sworn soldier in the kingdom could refuse such a request? Taetus grimaced, but again said nothing. This was dirty business that he wanted no part of.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Counselor, can you handle the evacuation?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course, Your Grace,” Taetus said. “I’ll begin preparations the moment we’re done here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded to herself, looking again out over the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus raised an eyebrow. Was that all? Really? Just “handle it, Taetus?” No bickering, no second guessing, no getting in his way?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith bent over to whisper in the Queen’s ear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I almost forgot.” Zelda let out a long sigh. “Regrettably, Chancellor Adresin was among the casualties in the battle near Talus that forced the retreat. Which leaves vacant the office of the Queen’s Justice. Due to a lack of time, available candidates, and… Ugh, whatever. The justifications don’t matter and you deserve it. Prime Counselor Taetus: I, Queen Zelda Numenia Proventia Hyrule, hereby charge you with enforcing my law, and upholding justice and public order throughout the kingdom. Do you accept my charge?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nearly choked on his own tongue. “Whaa… me? The Queen’s—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Do you accept my charge?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh,” Taetus blinked, then gathered his bearings, rose from his seat, and knelt. “Yes, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright then, that’s that,” Zelda said. “Rise with my blessing, Chancellor Taetus, and I’ll leave you to it. Laylith, please arrange for security so I can make a public announcement. The sooner the better. There’s so much work to be done.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ah—and there it was. Taetus stood. “Your Grace, if I may?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda groaned. “What is it, Taetus?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did his best to mask his annoyance behind a friendly smile. When would she learn? This was never personal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Might I ask what it is you intend to announce to the public?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shrugged. “The evacuation? Your promotion? My plans to mark a champion with the blessings of Hylia to turn the tides in battle?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm… tricky. Very tricky. He needed to be careful here so as not to unduly upset her.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Absolute Cool!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The seconds stretched out, giving him just enough time to compose the right words.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He couldn’t help but grin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I’m afraid I must object in the strongest possible terms. Evacuating Castletown is no small feat, and a delicate one at that. The slightest misstep or failure of coordination could result in a panic, leading to delays and ultimately disaster. Further, I fear that despite your intentions, you may be sending mixed messages. Why are the people to evacuate if the Champion of Hylia is anointing a hero to save them? Do we <i>expect</i> the hero to fail?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Okay</i>, okay. I get it,” Zelda said irritably. “You made your point—I’m shit at public relations. What do you suggest I do instead?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about it, Your Grace,” Taetus said. “You have plenty enough on your hands already. Why not just leave it to me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda put her hands up. “Alright, fine. It’s on you. I trust you can handle it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Most. Excellent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus again bowed low, then took his leave. He strode confidently from the room, feeling a million rupees richer already. At this rate, even Lensa would be begging him for scraps within a month.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>And just wait until Nyllara hears!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He could barely contain himself. History would remember these days, when it was a common man who kept the people of Castletown safe and fed, and who ushered in a new era of economic prosperity in the wake of a Blight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chancellor Taetus, Supreme Benefactor of Hyrule.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Who’s the most badass conniving politician in the world? Oh yes, that’s right. You are.</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Taetus stepped back from the chalkboard and rested his chin on one hand. The ordering followed simply enough from districting and proximity to gates. However—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do we even have enough guards on hand to secure the routes?” Counselor Semmes asked, clearly on the same page. “And what of wagons? Carts? Unless I’m mistaken…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You are not,” Taetus said. “That will be a tough one to maneuver. I’ll have to see what I can do.” He shook his head slowly. To complicate matters even further, the nobles would undoubtedly want to abscond with their possessions at the soonest opportunity—interfering with the need to secure transit for food, supplies, and people first. Not to mention the crisis of public order should the city lords be seen to abandon their districts in time of need. It was a most delicate situation, to be sure. Then of course there were the <i>high nobles</i>, who would argue—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And the elderly, wounded, infirm…?” Counselor Roldath asked. “I mean, there is some leeway in choice of destination, but still. I needn’t say it, but some of them wouldn’t survive the journey to Dunwich—let alone Orilon or Westborne.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus grinned. As much as he would love to dump a few thousand refugees on Lensa’s doorstep…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm, yes,” Counselor Derin said. “I’m not sure there is a way around that one. What were the last census numbers?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sixty eight thousand, three hundred and twenty six,” Taetus quoted from memory. “And right around twenty percent of that in those categories.” Less than the peak of nearly a hundred thousand just after the first siege, since many farmers in the northern province had deemed it safe enough to return to their holdings in the past month. But even then…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any ideas?” Derin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“None at present,” Taetus said after a moment. “But not to worry; I am certain I will think of something in time,” he half-lied, playing to his own character. The others nodded. Taetus knew it was best to keep up the veneer of authority and confidence, even if he himself was unsure in the moment. If they were to succeed in this nigh-impossible task, he couldn’t have even his advisors questioning his ability to lead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That does present some difficulties for staging,” Roldath said. “It won’t be as clean as I had hoped, but…” he trailed off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nods all around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shall we set up staging grounds <i>outside</i> the city, then?” Semmes suggested.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not sure we have any other option,” Roldath said, stating the obvious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are we certain we have enough manpower for that?” Derin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We will have to rely on the noble houses to supplement with their personal guard,” Taetus replied. “At least for the time being. Although, by reports we should have military assistance from the southern forces soon enough—first arrivals by the eleventh of First Flows.” Three days. Surely they could hold everything together for that long?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Excuse me, Chancellor?” Aethis said from the doorway to the chamber. “Countess Esrae has just arrived, and the others are growing restless. Are we ready to convene? Shall I send them in?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus glanced irritably over his shoulder at the boy. No, they <i>weren’t</i> ready. They needed more time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Time, however, they did not have.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you Aethis,” Taetus said. “Yes, please send them in.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The aide bowed and hurried from the room. A moment later, the doors opened and a dozen dignitaries entered the council chambers: three high nobles (or rather, <i>one</i> high noble and two second sons), eight city lords, and one High Bishop.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Welcome, Your Holiness, and thank you for joining us on such short notice,” Taetus said with a bow, addressing High Bishop Rharu first, as was proper. Rharu nodded to him and the other counselors and took a seat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Countess Esrae,” Taetus said. A short bow was met with another nod. She and the others stood in a loose cluster on the chamber floor, looking uncertainly between each other. “And my lords and ladies,” Taetus finished. “Welcome all, and let us waste no time. I have called you here today because Castletown faces another siege.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gasps, mutterings, and a shrill cry. Lady Raspel fainted and was helped to her feet by Lord Abmont.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>No!</i> You can’t be serious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I thought we were winning the war?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Where is the Lord General?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Where’s the <i>Queen</i>?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother Above, what are we doing <i>here</i>? We should be—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I demand to speak with the Queen!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Order.” Taetus held up a hand, but the clamor continued. “Order!” he shouted over the chamber. “The Council is now in session, and the chamber will come to order!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Silence at last. Taetus cleared his throat to speak just as Lord Marvek of House Kah stepped forward from the group.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh? What was this?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In session?” the young man asked rhetorically. “This is not the time for games, <i>Counselor</i>. We need—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Chancellor, actually,” Taetus corrected. He waited a moment to let that sink in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Pardon?” Lord Marvek eyed him uncertainly, then looked back over his shoulder to Lord Nedar of House Nen.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus grinned. Oh, this would do nicely. If he played his cards just right… “That would be <i>Chancellor Taetus</i> now, if you please, Lord Marvek,” he said. Brief pause… “Unfortunately, Chancellor Adresin met with an untimely end in a recent battle—the details of which, among much else, will be made clear in due time. Following news of the coming siege, I have been charged by our Queen with overseeing the evacuation of Castletown, and have also been appointed to the office of Queen’s Justice. Just as before, in these trying times I will require from each of you the utmost—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>—Bastard!</i>” Lord Nedar of House Nen spat, right on queue. “We won’t stand for this! If you think we’re just going to roll over and…”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Most splendid,</i> Taetus thought, letting the young man rant to his heart’s content. Like father, like son.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus took the free moment to ponder again on the situation. Roldath was right; there were far too many citizens incapable of making even a moderate journey in good health, and no way to make up the deficit in wagons or beasts of burden to carry them. It was perhaps the greatest challenge they faced. They would have to prioritize somehow, and that was not going to be pretty. People dropping dead on the trail just wouldn’t do, and they couldn’t leave them behind, either. Unless…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Ah.</i> That might actually work?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus looked up. By the Goddesses, was that buffoon still talking? —Oh, good, he was done.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Bailiff, please escort Lord Nedar from the chamber,” Taetus said casually. “He is clearly upset at Adresin’s passing, and unable to fulfill his duties.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A stunned silence settled over the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Get your hands off me! I’m not—I said <i>get your hands off!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lord Nedar: the Crown requires you to send a replacement to represent House Nen immediately,” Taetus said. “Oh, and please send your father my warmest regards.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This isn’t over!” Nedar said as he was dragged away. “Mark my words, Taetus! You just wait!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus waited patiently for the ruckus to be finished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any other objections? …No? Well, then as I was saying…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“But of course, Mrs. Ermis,” Taetus said reassuringly in front of the small crowd that had gathered near the market district. “You have absolutely nothing to fear. The Lord General is confident in his strategy, and he expects that this maneuver will allow us to defeat the final warlord, thus bringing a swift and final end to the Blight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But what about Talus?” the old woman said, clearly confused. “And the war? I thought we were winning?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus gave a solemn nod, then spoke again in a hushed tone. “I won’t lie to you: our situation is dire,” he said. “I fear our ancient enemy has rediscovered the secrets of <i>soulsteel</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Gasps and hushed cries sounded throughout the crowd, but Taetus held up a hand. Every man and woman present held on bated breath to his next words.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is true: the Blin have forced a temporary retreat. But no matter! Our Queen still possesses a remnant of her blessings from the Mother Goddess, and I have word from her that she plans to use these blessings to combat the fel beasts when the time comes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused, looking over their faces, into each of their eyes in turn. “As ever, my friends, Hyrule <i>will</i> prevail. But—and it all hinges on this…” He leaned in, voice barely loud enough to be heard by those in back. “If we are to succeed, then I require each and every one of you to do your parts. I have already spoken with the city lords, and in the coming days…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“…My friends, I wish I could say otherwise, but the times ahead of us will be difficult. As ever, Hyrule <i>will</i> prevail, so long as each and every one of us does our part in the coming days. I must leave you now to attend to my duties, but you need only look to Lady Veres for direction…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“…Fear not, my friends. I have met with the Council and together we have come up with a plan to ensure the swift and safe evacuation of this district. However, in order for the Lord General’s stratagem to work, each and every one of us <i>must</i> do our parts. I leave you now to attend to other pressing matters, but Lord Beril has my full confidence, and he will see you through the coming days…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“These too. And those… and those. Not those!” Zelda said, scurrying from bookshelf to bookshelf in her study as she directed the staff on which items to take and which to leave behind. The Blin might get her city, but they would <i>not</i> have her books.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked around. “Sera?” she called. “…Sera?” Where had that girl gotten—oh, she was right there. Zelda blushed slightly at the sight of the younger woman’s knowing smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still here,” Sera said warmly. “What can I do for you, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you get them started in the library too?” Zelda asked. “I know everyone’s busy, so tell them it’s not <i>top</i> priority, but highest non-top priority. Whatever that is—I’m sure there’s a word for it but it’s escaping me right now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace. Right away.” Sera winked, then turned to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, wait! Except for, uh…” Zelda tapped her chin, then grabbed a loose sheet of paper from her satchel along with a quill to jot down a list of titles.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ugh. On second thought, there were way too many to list.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know what? Just bring back everything I’ve checked out in the past year plus every scholarly work on the subject of magic. Emphasis on ‘scholarly’. Just cross-reference the catalogues. If it doesn’t mention a sage in the authorship, don’t bother. Got that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course!” Sera said. She turned to leave, then pivoted back in place. “Pardon, but how do I know which ones you’ve checked out?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda covered up her face. “Sorry. Uh, just ask Madame Lerii if she’s still there. If not…” She broke off as she noticed Shesan strolling into her study out of the corner of her eye. Ugh, what now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…If not, then I’ll ask around for help?” Sera suggested.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Yes, sorry. Thank you, Sera. You’re amazing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sera curtsied and promptly took off. Zelda made her way down the staircase—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—and stopped mid-stride as Fi materialized just ahead of her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress: an update as you requested. Link and his party have just departed their campsite on horseback. Estimated time of arrival: approximately one hour. As per your previous orders, I will soon be focusing my undivided attention there so as to provide assistance if needed. Is there anything else I should relay to Master Link?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, Fi,” Zelda said. “Thank you for the update. Wish them luck for me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Not like they’d need it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi turned her head slightly as if pondering the request, then nodded. “Yes, Mistress. I will do so.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her ethereal form dispersed, leaving Zelda standing face to face with the woman of her nightmares.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have a moment?” Shesan asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Not really.</i> “Sure! What brings…” No, wait. Zelda groaned. “Hold on. Fi, wait!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Mistress?” the spectre said, reappearing before her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda paused a moment, collecting her thoughts. “Before Link and the others have a chance to get into trouble, I want to try an idea. It shouldn’t take long.” It was a long shot, but…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned back to Shesan. “Sorry, time-critical. Mind waiting just a minute?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hrm… Zelda glanced around her study. Would just any rod do? Or was there perhaps something she could use that was already conceptually close to a ‘magic rod’? That seemed important. Maybe she should have given this more thought.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She darted over to the hearth to grab an iron poker, and then ran back upstairs to retrieve a lodestone from her desk. Thankfully, it was still there.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi floated after her, and Shesan followed closely behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, Shesan?” Zelda asked as she set to work magnetizing the poker by running the lodestone repeatedly along its length. “Know anything about magic rods?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…<i>Magic</i> rods?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda glanced up as she continued to work. Shesan just stood there, eyeing her impassively. Zelda sighed. “I’ll take that as a no?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “I suppose if you’d like to tell me what you think ‘magic rods’ are, I could tell you whether or not your conception concords with my own understanding, if indeed I have any on the subject.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rolled her eyes. Back to this again? “You know we might die soon, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’ll see what we can do about that, won’t we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda put it from her mind. She wasn’t about to get into another argument with her this early in the day.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She set aside the lodestone and held up the iron bar. That should do it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Magnets aren’t understood all that well,” Zelda said. “Lodestones are theorized to contain a primordial manifestation of green magic.” She took a barrette from her hair and held it up to the rod. It clung weakly to the surface, in defiance of gravity. She held the bar upside down to show as much, then removed the pin and set it aside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s little more than a parlor trick, but you can transfer a lodestone’s power to an iron rod by rubbing it along its length, just as you saw me do. Some other metals work, but most don’t. Unfortunately, if it’s possible to extract the magic from lodestones, the knowledge has been lost. Attempting to work a lodestone or a magnetized bar into other metals, or grinding them into powder for other uses destroys the magic. As far as I’m aware, the only known use for the trick is in creating compasses.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda paused to check with Shesan. She seemed to be listening intently. “Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My thinking is that if we start with magnetized iron rod—the closest thing I can think of to what might be considered a ‘magic rod’, and then imbue it with magic until it is heightened to a more conceptually pure form…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She held the rod out at arm’s length, then drew on her green affinity and pushed a steady current of magic into the item until it lit up with a faint green glow. It took a little over a third of her reserves, by her estimate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, can you suffuse this with Divine Power? Aim for around fifty units.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Certainly, Mistress,” Fi said. She twirled once and wisps of chromatic vapor trailed from her into the rod. Zelda waited in eager anticipation. Shesan raised a curious eyebrow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned. “Notice anything, Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative, Mistress,” Fi said. “I do not detect any changes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm…” Zelda said, waving the rod around. She turned and whipped it in the direction of the far wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh well,” she said with a sigh, setting it back down on her desk. “Was worth a shot.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“May I?” Shesan asked, reaching for the item.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shrugged. “Sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan took the rod and held it over the pin. It flew up from the table and snapped to its surface with an audible <i>click</i>. “Hmm… interesting. And what was it you were trying to do, exactly?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gave her a smug grin. “Well, I had hoped to create an actual magic rod. A device that can store magic and allow anyone to later release it in bursts of energy. Given that the Blin have rediscovered soulsteel, I had hoped that perhaps we could arm our own warriors with another ancient weapon. Help to even the odds.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Shesan said, setting the rod back down. “And what made you think that suffusing it with Void Power would do anything?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda crossed her arms with a grunt. “Didn’t you have something you wanted to say?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It wasn’t a rhetorical question,” Shesan said, raising her palms. “I’m genuinely curious.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mistress, do you require my continued presence?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh, right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry, Fi. No, I think we’re good for now,” Zelda said. A thought. “Hey—before you leave, do you think you could reabsorb the Divine Power you put into the rod?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Void Power,” Shesan corrected.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The stuff she’s made of? The magic that powers her?” Shesan offered. “It isn’t unique to her, and it certainly isn’t ‘divine’ in origin. I did tell you she is a being constructed from the Void and held together with magic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shrugged. “Fine, <i>Void Power</i> then.” Whatever.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi hummed and shifted colors, then floated above the rod. She concentrated for a moment, then a mist of chromatic vapor drifted out from it. She swirled around the mist, collecting what she could.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have successfully reclaimed approximately seventy percent of the—” She paused, looking between Zelda and Shesan. “—Void Power expended in the attempt to charge the item.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “Thank you, Fi. That will be all for now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi faded away, leaving her alone with Shesan once more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Awkward silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So what made you think—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I don’t know!” Zelda said irritably. “We—or at least <i>I</i>—don’t know anything about ‘Void Power’ and its uses. Only what I’ve learned from Fi. Given that <i>presumably</i> it is a force that has not been seen in the world for some time, I thought that perhaps, maybe, it just might have been the missing element to constructing magic rods.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded. “And you’re certain magic rods once existed?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waved a hand from side to side. “Not exactly. That’s part of the problem—there are so many stories and legends, and the veracity of records degrades as we look further and further to the past. I have no reason to believe they <i>aren’t</i> possible. They feature heavily in some older tales from the earliest periods of the Forsaken Era. Further, energy bursts are a thing, and we can imbue arbitrary objects with magic, so…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded again. “Seems sensible enough. Although I must caution you, sometimes even the most sensible of theories fail to hold up under scrutiny.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed her. “Not going to chastise me for ‘playing around with things I don’t understand?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan shrugged. “I did caution you not to, but as you seem hell-bent on ignoring my counsel anyway, I suppose the next best thing is to see to it that you don’t screw up and destroy us all in a cataclysmic explosion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started, doing a double take. “Wait, can magic actually—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>By the gods</i>, girl, no! Don’t even think about it!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda held her gaze for a long moment. “Fine. What was it you wanted to tell me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan took a breath, then turned to the side and rubbed her forehead. She looked out over the railing of the second floor to the workers below. “Can we go somewhere more… private?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure,” Zelda said, gesturing and then leading the way to a private office.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Shesan wasted no time once the door was closed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just earlier, Golvara and his escort came into contact with a group of corrupted Zora. Two of his retainers and one of the three Sheikah sent to aid him were killed in the engagement. Golvara managed to escape with the other two. His safe return is far from certain, but they are closing in on Zora-held territory and, I expect, will be back at Last Bastion in a matter of days. We don’t have a more precise estimate yet, though I will update you the moment we do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a breath. “Wow. Okay.” She ran her fingers through her hair as she pieced through the information. “Unfortunate. But good news overall?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. Zelda bit her lip, looking to Shesan suspiciously. <i>Just earlier?</i> How exactly did she get the information so quickly?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s more, the teams sent to rendezvous with Vesyrn made contact about six hours ago. Following a pitched battle, <i>Allanah</i> and two of the six Sheikah have been taken into custody by Vesyrn and the other four. One of the captives is in critical condition, though Vesyrn believes he may yet survive. Allanah herself is refusing to go any further, or even allowing the others to complete their mission unhindered, even on pain of torture and under threat of death. She claims her directives were from Vian, and cannot be countermanded except by direct order from the Crown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda buried her face in her hands. “Okay, yeah. That’s… problematic. But I’m not sure that…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She trailed off as Shesan extended a hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s mind froze. “Uh?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Before you ask,” Shesan said, “I have precisely the same capacity as you to communicate to certain of my agents at a distance; namely Vesyrn, Golvara, and Naibi. And, yes, this is the first moment I have found it directly relevant or otherwise important for you to know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…You mean, like with Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Shesan said. “Exactly that. Now if you would—” she gestured again with her hand “—this will need to be brief. I haven’t the power to keep it up for long. I need you to tell Allanah to do as Vesyrn commands. Got it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded hesitantly and took the strange woman’s hand, clamping down for now on the complex swirl of emotions she felt in her stomach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world flashed white, and Zelda found herself standing in a clearing a few meters from the edge of a forest. A tall, burly man with black hair and a scraggly beard stood looming over a lithe woman with blonde hair, bound and restrained as she was forced to kneel on the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn, and Allanah.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two turned to face Zelda, and Shesan who stood at her side. The captive woman looked up. Her face was bruised and bloodied, and she had a wild look in her eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Princess Zelda? Is that really you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan squeezed her hand, and Zelda took in a sharp breath. “Queen Zelda, now. Allanah—listen to me carefully. Much has transpired, and much depends on your success here. I need you to follow Vesyrn and do as he commands. The fate of the whole world is at stake.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Allanah bowed her head. “Yes, Your Grace. As you command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world flashed white again, and Zelda stumbled back as she was overcome by vertigo. She landed in a chair back at the office near her study.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…How?” was all Zelda could think to say.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Irrelevant,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head. “How can you even <i>think</i> that? This is—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I assure you, the process I went through is not repeatable nor in any way open to scrutiny from this side of the veil. Further, I’m not about to stand here and listen to you chide me on not making better use of the very same abilities you yourself have access to. Unlike you, I have been <i>quite</i> busy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grit her teeth. “I can’t project myself to the other side of the kingdom at will, <i>Shesan</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, but Fi can.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You ficking idiot! We’re in the middle of a fight for our existence! This whole ‘I’m only going to tell you things you need to know’ is ridiculous!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The words settled, and the room was quiet for a long moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know it may seem that way, but I have my reasons,” Shesan said. “Our enemy is great and powerful, and there are certain things I cannot risk. Believe it or not, there <i>are</i> worse things than death, Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay. That gave her pause.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…There has to be <i>some</i> way we can—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She cut off as Fi manifested herself yet again in the small room. “Mistress: a critical update. Link and his team have encountered a potent magical presence…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Jedal—the single Sheikah guard Taetus brought with him at Laylith’s insistence—held a torch high as Taetus and four city lords climbed down the ladder from the dark, musty chamber and into the recesses below.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh, what is that smell?” Lady Bellane asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus refrained from comment as he reached the bottom and lit his own torch. Behind him, Lord Larmak helped Lady Bellane and then Lady Nerem off the ladder. Lord Broll was the last to follow. The sounds of rushing water grew louder as they continued on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A minute or so later, Taetus pried open the first rusty iron door along the hallway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What in damnation is that?!” Lord Broll said, in all likelihood remarking on the admittedly imaginative interrogation device situated squarely at the center of the small cell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother Above…” Lady Bellane whispered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My lords and ladies,” Taetus said. “As you can see, this is a last resort, intended only for those who absolutely cannot make the journey otherwise. As we speak, Bishop Olo has already begun enlisting volunteers to tend to and guard those we must leave behind. But again, I must stress…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“You needn’t worry, Count Dannek,” Taetus said. “As always, I honor my debts.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes… quite,” Dannek said dryly. “And you’re sure you can arrange this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nodded. “I have already sent for two full caravans,” he lied through his teeth. “One from Kakariko and one from the northern marches. The first will arrive in eight day’s time. Now—in exchange for arranging for the safe transport of your family’s ancient and priceless pottery, I will require…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Truthfully, no such caravans existed. However, at least this way they could get all the grain out of the city before Count Dannek wizened up to his ploy. This was a massive risk to be sure, and one that would no doubt earn him much ire, but by the time anyone figured it out, he’d have the support of the military and wouldn’t be reliant on House Kah in the slightest. With luck, he might even be able to arrange for a suitable excuse to absolve him of any responsibility…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“You needn’t worry, Countess Esrae,” Taetus said. “As always, I honor my debts.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Countess eyed him dubiously. “Just to clarify: right of first refusal on all insurance contracts when we return? For three seasons? You’re certain you can swing that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But of course,” Taetus said with a grin. “I have made other arrangements with House Kah… and let us just say that Count Marlas is not exactly in the best position to negotiate.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Taking a short respite from the day’s work, Taetus eased into the luxurious kodongo leather chair of his new office. There was still so much to be done, but—barring unforeseen complications—the most difficult parts were behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To his delight, he found the chair to be exceedingly comfortable. And the room was so spacious as well! He could definitely get used to this. Having his own workspace, free from the prying eyes of even the other Counselors?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Idly, he gazed out over the castle grounds through the window of the balcony. To his dismay, he saw roughly three dozen able hands busy carting <i>books</i> from the castle library.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He let out a long sigh. It was necessary, he supposed. He understood the reasoning—still, did Zelda have to be so <i>public</i> about it? Surely even she could understand it wasn’t great for optics.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was just all so…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Absurd,” he muttered to himself, spinning around in his chair and looking up at the ceiling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If only Nyllara hadn’t had to leave the city. He found himself most in want of her good company.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus nearly jumped out of his seat as the ethereal form of the Emisary of Hylia materialized in front of him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Master: I have a critical update for you…”</span>
<br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Mistress: I can no longer sense Link’s presence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s lip trembled and her eyes burned. She turned to gaze out of the window of her study. They had been anxiously awaiting news of Link’s fate ever since Fi informed them of the danger an hour ago. Still, she never thought he could… he was really…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So he’s dead, then?” Shesan asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncertain,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda spun. She looked between Shesan, Taetus, and Laylith, then back to Fi. “I don’t understand. If he’s not dead, then…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As I said: I can no longer sense his presence,” Fi said. “He is beyond my reach.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So… he’s not dead?” Taetus asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi hummed as her colors shifted. “Unknown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head. They weren’t phrasing the question right. “Fi, what is your estimate that Link is still alive?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unknown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her face and let out a groan, then turned and collapsed into the nearest chair. She felt like she was going to be sick. There was so much to deal with already. She couldn’t take this too.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She looked up. Of course, everyone was looking to <i>her</i> for direction.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Laylith, I want you to gather every single mage and seeker in the kingdom that can make it back to Castletown before the Blin arrive. <i>Every. Single. One.</i> We are going to look into the information Link recovered from the Spire, and see what can be done.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith snapped to arms with a salute. “Yes, Your Grace! At once.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned and left the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stood and rounded on Shesan. The woman started and took a half-step back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…And by the Goddesses, Shesan. One way or the other, you are going to help us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan gave a single slow nod. “I’ll do what I can.”</span>
<br><br>
