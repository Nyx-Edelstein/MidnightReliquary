<span>Vigilant and wary, Link proceeded down the dark, winding corridor. As he rounded the second corner, he saw light up ahead. Further in, the corridor opened to a large, dimly-lit room. The light wasn’t quite enough to see by, but he could at least make out a few details.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just ahead, at the eastern side of the room, was a roped-off area with four posts in a square. He couldn’t be certain, but it looked very much like a sparring arena. Link strapped his lantern to his belt and put on his shield—just in case. Who knew what to expect in this place?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He scanned the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If he had to guess, it was somewhere between a half and a third the size of the cavern with the remains of the massive worm-thing. The ceiling however was just as high, and diffuse light shone through from a circular opening at its center. Below the opening, at the center of the room, was a massive pit that ran lengthwise across the room, east to west. It was a good six or seven meters deep, and was filled with sand at the bottom. Half-a-dozen or so iron ladders lined the eastern and western edges of the pit at regular intervals, and at the northern and southern sides were rows of staggered benches.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Strange. Very strange. Was it a fighting pit? Link wasn’t sure what else it could be.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He decided to explore the room, walking clockwise along the pit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Along the southern wall he found a short recess blocked off by thick iron bars. At the far side—about three meters in—was an ornate chest trimmed in green and gold.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He got a closer look. The bars were thick and sturdy—no way he was breaking through, even with magic. Maybe with a long enough pole he could get at the chest?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He continued on for now. At the western end of the room was a row of target dummies and a couple of weapon racks. The weapons they held looked to be in decent condition, though all of the edges were blunted and the points rounded off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link spun, taking in the room as a whole and seeing it for the first time. Was the Obsidian Spire just an abandoned Lightsworn training ground?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Relaxing a measure, he continued on clockwise around the pit. Past the northern row of stone benches, at the northeast corner of the room, was a metal hatch facing diagonally upward. It had two handles on either side, and looked to open horizontally inwards. A sign hung over it, but Link couldn’t read what it said. It didn’t look like any language he was familiar with.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just off to the side were two switches that looked just like the one from earlier. Above them in a line were three exposed gears resting on spokes that jutted out a couple inches from the wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, can you read that sign?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Negative, Master. However, based on previous observations at the Temple of Time, I conjecture it may be Old Script; probability: seventy point six percent. Conditional on the language not being Old Script, my models overwhelmingly predict it to be a close variant.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Old Script, huh? Link took a few moments to dig out some paper and a charcoal pen out of his pack, copying down the writing for later. If nothing else, perhaps Vestele or someone else at the temple could translate it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finished, he stowed everything away. Now, back for that chest…</span>
<br><br>
<span>On his way back past the weapons racks, Link took one of the spears and the halberd and crudely tied them together using a length of rope. Heading back to the southern edge of the room, he poked his makeshift chest-opening implement through the iron bars.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…<i>Urg!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It was significantly more unwieldy than he expected when holding it like this. The crude implement wobbled uncontrollably at the far end, and despite his best efforts he was unable to open the chest from this distance. He also tried snagging the outside hook of the halberd to the corner of the chest and pulling it towards him, but it was either too heavy to budge or was otherwise fixed to the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A few more minutes of unfruitful struggle and Link decided to give up. There had to be some other way in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unsure what else to do, he threw aside the makeshift implement and headed back over to the sparring arena. Steeling himself, he readied his sword and shield and hopped inside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…He waited with bated breath, but nothing happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link felt like smacking himself. What was he expecting? Some random opponent to just pop out of the ground and attack him? Right now he felt rather foolish, but mere moments ago it had made <i>some</i> kind of sense…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head and climbed out of the arena, returning to the switches and the hatch at the northwest corner. Maybe they held the key to progressing?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link inspected the hatch more closely. The handles were latched shut with a simple locking mechanism. He flipped it open and pushed inward. The flaps gave way without so much as a creak, and Link peered inside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On the other side was a dark, narrow tunnel leading away into darkness towards the north. The path was blocked by thick iron bars, and the rounded walls and ceiling were incredibly smooth. Directly ahead and to his right—to the east and south—were thick metal grates. The holes in the grates were less than an inch in diameter. Link couldn’t make out anything on the other side of either grate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was nothing else of note here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link drew back and closed the hatch, eyeing the switches. He was hesitant to fool with them, but it didn’t seem he had much choice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Left or right?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He chose the right switch and gave it a firm pull. It wouldn’t budge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay. Left then. He gave it a tug. <i>Click click click click click!</i> It ratcheted back into place as he released it, and the gears above spun. Link heard a low rumbling noise coming from nowhere in particular. He turned around to see guardrails rise up around the pit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Also, a stone door now blocked the entrance to the room from whence he came.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Nope.</i> He was not having any of that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link pulled the right switch. It ratcheted back into place with several clicks, and the gears spun in the opposite direction. He heard the sound of metal sliding over metal, then a gush of rushing wind. The air pressure in the room plummeted, and a wind picked up from nowhere. A moment later and a loud howling sound erupted from the center of the room, drowning out everything else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The central pit was now a miniature sandstorm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Aaaah!</i>” Link remarked, grabbing the left switch again. It wouldn’t budge. He definitely didn’t panic as he tried the right one a second time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…As it clicked back into place, the wind died down and the sandstorm stopped.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link pulled the left switch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The guardrails lowered and the entrance was once again open.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Phew.</i> He wiped his brow and let out a sigh of relief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait. Maybe…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link skirted back around the room to get a good look at the south end. Nope, the bars were still firmly in place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He headed back to the switches and pulled the left switch, raising the guardrails and closing the door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The bars were still there.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The right switch, activating the sandstorm in the pit?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nope.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother Above</i>, that wind was loud. Shielding his face, Link edged closer, trying to get a better look into the pit. Even with the light above, it was difficult to make out much of anything with the sand obscuring his vision.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link checked back at the metal hatch and tried to open it again. It was shut tight. He put all his weight into forcing it open, but it wouldn’t budge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned back to the sandpit. He was reluctant to venture into the pit with the mechanism active, but maybe that was the key? He donned his sand goggles, threw on a mask, and approached the edge, holding his lantern above his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even with the light of his lantern, he couldn’t make out much except for whirling clouds of sand. It didn’t <i>look</i> like anything big and nasty was down there…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Resigned, he approached one of the ladders and climbed down into the pit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As he traced around the north edge of the pit, two vaguely humanoid figures came into view—a pair of skeletons still half-buried in a mound of sand. The corpses had been stripped to the bone and wore only tattered cloth and leather straps. A pair of swords and shields lay next to their bodies. Something around the neck of one glinted as it caught and reflected the light of his lantern.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That certainly seemed worth checking out. But first, Link needed to make sure there weren’t any other surprises down here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Exploring the rest of the pit, he found several small indentations along the floor, each less than two feet deep. There were six in total; each of them uniquely shaped—each the bottom half of one of the perfect solids: sphere, tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was it a puzzle? If so, Link had no idea what he was supposed to do to solve it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Reasonably confident there weren’t any hidden traps or lurking monsters, he approached the skeletons and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stopped in his tracks, a sense of foreboding tickling at the back of his mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Stalfos weren’t real—they were just stories. Scary tales told to children to get them to behave. <i>They weren’t real.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…Were they?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Better safe than sorry. Heart thumping in his chest, Link rushed the skeletons, stomping their skulls into pieces and breaking a few of the other bones for good measure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Looking back over the mess, he felt rather silly. <i>Stalfos?</i> Really?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tried to push past the thought, getting to work inspecting their remains. There wasn’t much of note. Their weapons were rusted and looked very rough; unusably so. The remnants of their tattered clothing was likewise uninteresting. He did however find a red gemstone on a necklace hanging down into one of the skeleton’s rib cages.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link hefted it in his hand. It was almost identical to the blue one from earlier.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Blue gemstone: blue-runed door. Red gemstone…? Was it really that easy?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link frowned. What was this skeleton doing with a red gemstone anyway? And how had these people died? Had they come here together, or had they fought to the death? And if the one was capable of holding onto a gemstone without being burned… Did that mean they too were a Lightsworn? —Or rather, that they had started on the path. Link had to remind himself that he wasn’t a full Lightsworn yet, despite nearly everyone else’s insistence to the contrary…</span>
<br><br>
<span>It really bothered him that he didn’t have any answers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing else left to do, he climbed back out of the pit and made his way back over to the switches. Time to return to the others and let them know what he had found.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br />
<span>“Lightsworn training grounds, huh?” Grenja asked skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, in part.” Link gestured behind to the once-grand vestibule. “I mean, it was probably also a temple or holy site, judging by the murals and stuff.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about the worm-thing?” Grenja asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know,” Link said honestly. “Maybe they were training to fight it? Or maybe they were just guarding the place so it couldn’t get out.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So let me get this straight,” Grenja said. “For who knows how long—possibly <i>thousands</i> of years—the Lightsworn can’t manage to kill a giant worm monster. Then one day, big G-man just waltzes on in here and gives it what-for. Is that what you’re telling me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seriously?” Koja let out a long sigh from a few paces behind. “Grenja, you are never allowed to question my naming of things ever again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sis, I don’t give a damn how many times you say it—I am not going to call us ‘The Party to Totally Lay Waste to All Evil,’” Grenja said emphatically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you just did,” Koja said. “Was that so hard?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That does not count!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look—I don’t have the answers any more than you do,” Link said, ignoring their squabble. “Just sharing what I saw. We know it has to be related to Lightsworn <i>somehow</i>.” They came to a stop in front of the red-runed door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well <i>I</i> think it makes sense,” Koja said. “At least, about as much sense as anything else in here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link held up the red gem to the circular inset. Just as before, it leapt from his fingers and snapped into place. The runes glowed, the gem turned, and the door slid upward, disappearing into the wall. Light from the area ahead illuminated the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No kidding,” Ryn said dryly. She approached the open doorway, arm outstretched.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Vwoom!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“See?” Koja said with a stretch and a yawn. “Told you.” She turned back to the entryway. “Cards, anyone?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t think I’m gonna forget—you still owe me from last game,” Grenja said, turning to follow her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And I’ll pay up!” Koja said. “You know I’m good for it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja grumbled. He gave Link a thumbs-up just as he rounded the corner. Link lamely returned the gesture a second too late.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I really hate you by the way,” Ryn said to his side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link eyed her. “For what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“For being so Mother-ficking awesome and having all the fun while us worthless plebs are left behind to stew in envy?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link winced. Did she really have to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, don’t give me that,” she said matter-of-factly, stepping in to thump him on the chest. “You want me, you get the whole me. <i>Mouth and all.</i>” She whispered the last words in his ear. Link shivered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fair enough,” he said, placing a hand over hers. It wasn’t like the Holy Mother was around to take offense. It would still take some getting used to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked down into her eyes. Her beautiful, green eyes…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Ryn said with a sly grin, gesturing to the barrier and stepping aside. “I can’t hope to live vicariously through tales of your glorious exploits if you don’t get to exploiting.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” Link said, rubbing his neck. “Guess I should get going.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I eagerly await your return, O glorious hero,” she said playfully.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link stood in what, by all appearances, was a spacious and luxurious living area. This was <i>definitely</i> an abandoned Lightsworn training ground. What else could it be?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He paused. Something was off… Why was everything here so well preserved? This had all been here since time immemorial, and yet none of it looked any worse for wear. He trailed a finger over a rather comfy-looking chair. There wasn’t even a layer of dust.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Odd. Was it the magic of the barrier?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Come to think of it, what was the rest of the facility for? There was no way the areas he had already visited comprised even half of the bottom level of the massive five-tiered structure. Where was everything?</span>
<br><br>
<span>First thing first. Link checked a nearby bookshelf—he would never hear the end of it from Zelda if he left these behind. There were a total of seven books on its shelves, all in seemingly pristine condition, though he couldn’t read any of the titles. He opened one, scanning the pages.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, is this Old Script too?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>It is likely, Master.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you think it’s enough for you to translate?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Depending on the contents, it may be suitable; however, I estimate it will take several hours and will require you to page through each book so that I may observe its contents in full. Master, given the circumstances, I suggest we postpone this activity until a more opportune time.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, I’m right with you on that,” Link said. He closed the book and set it back on the shelf. When he was done here, he could cart these back to the others and have Fi do her thing. One of them could turn the pages for her while he got some rest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stood and went clockwise around the room. He checked the stone door. It had no runes, no socket, and there was no visible means of opening it. Behind the wooden door was a lavatory. Nothing interesting there.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To the southwest was what appeared to be a dormitory. Four double bunks rested at the corners of the room, with two small dressers between them at the north and south sides. A clay pot sat on top of the north dresser.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link checked the drawers of the south dresser. Empty. Same for the north. He turned back to—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Smash!</i> The pot fell to the ground and shattered. Whoops! He must have accidentally knocked it over with his gear as he turned. In the debris, he found a single green rupee lying on the floor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What the— Careful not to cut himself on the shards, he picked up the rupee and examined it. It was a regular green rupee; nothing the least bit strange about it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Who put rupees in pots? Was that some kind of ancient superstition?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unsure what else to do, he slipped it into a pocket for later examination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To the west from the main room was a supply closet. The shelves were mostly empty, save for a single pile of linens and a bar of soap. At the back of the room was another runed door. This one was purple, and a small sign hung over it. Did it lead further into the structure?</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Hmm. But it had no place to insert a gem.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Master, this sign matches verbatim what was written on the sign from the previous area. I remain unable to translate.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Interesting,” Link mumbled. “Thanks, Fi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Back from the main room, the northwest adjoining room was a mirror image of the southern barracks. Four double bunks, two empty dressers, and a single pot with a single green rupee inside. Tempting though it was, Link was careful not to break this one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The last room—to the north—was slightly larger than the others. There were two cots off to either side, a desk and chairs at the center, and a wooden chest against the wall at the far side.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Ah-ha!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>…Locked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They had lockpicks back at base camp, but Link wasn’t any skilled with them. Ryn could probably tease it open if he lugged it back, but the chest was firmly fixed in place. Oh well. Link took out a hammer and metal wedge from his pack and set to work breaking it open. It was difficult, but he managed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Inside were several loose sheets of paper and a shining purple gemstone. Link took the gemstone—he could come back for the papers along with the books later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link headed back to the closet and stood before the purple-runed door. He held the gemstone up to its surface. The runes and the gem pulsed in unison, and the door slid upwards, leaving him with the gemstone in hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. Neat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Beyond the door was a dark, narrow hallway stretching to the right, with a sharp bend at the end.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something about this gave Link pause. What kind of place hid the better part of a colossal structure behind a supply closet? Surely he was missing something. But where else was he supposed to go?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lantern in hand, he ventured forth.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“<i>AAAAHH—oomph!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link landed with a soft thud in a pile of sand. Gale-force winds blew in his face. He rolled out of the way and smacked into a wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ow.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was dark, and unbelievably windy. Despite being battered against the walls of the long wind tunnel as he was propelled into its depths, Link was uninjured, save for a few bruises.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no going back that way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He really should have been more careful before opening that last hatch. Link stood and dusted himself off—as well as he could, given there was now sand in his everything. A few moments of searching, and he located his lantern in the darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Luckily enough, it wasn’t any worse for wear. What’s more, his pack was intact a few feet from where he landed; its contents undamaged. His sword and bow were much the same, though his arrows were scattered about the small room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link refreshed his Luck and gathered up his equipment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A runed door at the edge of the room glowed faintly as he approached.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Shink!</i> Link stepped into the dark room and the door immediately closed behind him. Runes flared up along the walls and the ceiling lit up, illuminating the space inside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the center of the room was a pedestal with a small ornate box, trimmed in blue. A skeleton in tattered rags lay near its base.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the far side of the room was a stone door with blue runes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sighed, pulling out his bow and nocking an arrow. He fired a shot at the skeleton.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It didn’t budge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shot the box.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The floor underfoot shook and Link wobbled. A low rumbling from the center of the room and the pedestal receded into the floor as a circular aperture opened in the ceiling above.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Out of the opening, a large… shadowy blob-thing plopped down. Link stumbled back, getting a good look at the thing. Two long, multi-jointed limbs protruded from a black, almost gelatinous body that rippled as it made contact with the floor. It didn’t seem to have eyes; only two recesses where the eyes should be. Its only other facial feature was a gaping maw with rows and rows of teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Of course it had a gaping maw with rows and rows of teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link readied an arrow. Abruptly, the creature turned towards him and hobbled forward.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Plat, plat. Sklook. Plat, plat. Sklook.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link let the arrow loose, aiming directly between its sunken eye sockets. The voidspawn—it certainly looked like one and Link had no idea what else to call it—let out a terrible <i>hiss!</i> as the arrow landed. It writhed and flailed as a thick shadowy smoke billowed from its wound and its gelatinous mass deflated to nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Was that it? Seriously? Was that supposed to be a challenge?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link watched in dawning horror as the smoke coalesced into a cloud at the center of the room and poured into the skeletal remains lying on the floor. The skull’s eyes lit up with an orange fire. The once dormant bones began to shake and rattle. Black smoke clung tightly to them, inhabiting and animating the previously lifeless body. The skeleton curled its limbs and sprung off the ground with surprising dexterity, picking up its sword and shield. Stunned and distracted, Link failed to react as the Stalfos turned and bolted towards him.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Nope.</i> Link wasn’t giving it any chance. He threw his bow to the ground, readying his sword and shield and drawing sharply on his Red affinity as the skeletal warrior closed. Magic burned within his veins, and the world slowed to a crawl as his senses heightened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stepped forward and baited out an attack, then deftly dodged with his massively superior reflexes. The attack went wide; his opponent comically overextending. Before the Stalfos could recover, Link closed and severed its skull from its spine with a single precision strike.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The skull went flying as the bones collapsed into a heap. Link chased down and stomped on the skull for good measure, shattering it to pieces. The shadowy smoke inhabiting the skeleton evaporated.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Phew.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>A rumble and another slight tremor. The pedestal at the center of the room rose up from the floor. Link wasted no time claiming the blue gemstone inside.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link stood before a long wall lined with gears and cogs, with switches to the north and south that exposed massive wheel-mechanisms. This room likely held the key to the wind tunnels.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unfortunately, most of the gears were broken or missing teeth. There were a total of nine slots for gears on the wall, of which only the northmost two and the southmost one were in working order. Link checked his spare bag. He had… <i>appropriated</i> five gears from other areas in the structure, but previously neglected to take them with him. He looked back to the wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Five good gears. Six damaged gears.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Urg.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link tried anyway, prying the damaged ones loose with a dab of lantern oil and replacing them with the good ones from his bag. Finished, he double checked the last broken gear and replaced it with the least damaged one from the collection for good measure. It was only missing three teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He spun the northern wheel mechanism, throwing his weight into getting it moving again. As before, the gears on the wall started to spin; faster and faster as the motion traveled down the wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><b>CRACK!</b></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wheeled about. The damaged gear had cracked in half and was lying uselessly on the floor. What’s more, one of the adjoining gears had been stripped of teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He let out a sigh and headed back upstairs.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After catching his breath, Link pulled himself over and kicked off the waist-high barrier. The howling wind blew in his face and pressed against him, threatening to send him careening over the obstacles and back down to the start of the gauntlet. He strained against that incredible force, pumping his aching legs against a smooth stone floor that offered so little purchase. He ducked past and grabbed a swinging beam, positioning himself <i>just</i> right—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—and nearly collapsed after using the beam to leap over to the next safe area, ducking behind a pillar to shield himself from the unrelenting wind. Peering over the corner, Link saw he still had roughly two-thirds of the way to go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had massively underestimated the difficulty of this trial. There was <i>no way</i> he could keep going like this, and he couldn’t afford to burn all his magic without a guaranteed way back to have Fi restore it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link unfastened the length of rope around his belt and fished out a hook from his pack. It would be slow going, but if he was going to make it to the end of this challenge without dying of exhaustion, he would have to be more methodical in his approach.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>So… tired…</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a final burst of speed, Link ran and dived into a small alcove at the end of the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Finally. Finally he was done. He shook his nearly-empty canteen and downed the last bit of water.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mother Above, that was exhausting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked over to see a switch next to a solid stone door. Above the switch was two exposed gears. Just what he needed! Maybe he could operate the mechanism now. Link pulled the switch, which predictably opened the way ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Another</i> wind tunnel? Link wasn’t about to get sucked in this time. His ribs still ached from the last misadventure. No way he was going to get blown around like a ragdoll again.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Uhh… what do you need <i>all</i> the rope for, again?” Koja asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wrndm tmnfl,” Link replied, craming the lengths of rope into his pack. He took a swig of water, swallowed, then bit off another chunk of jerky. Fi’s stamina restoration magic was a blessing from the Goddesses, but relying on it so heavily left him feeling like he’d missed a day’s worth of meals. Thankfully, they had rations to spare.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja blinked. “Sorry, didn’t quite catch that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think he said ‘wind tunnel,’” Ryn said, not even bothering to look up from her cards.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mhmmpfh,” Link said. He waved a goodbye and gulped down more water as he set out.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Shink!</i> The stone door closed behind him. Runes glowed along the walls and the ceiling lit up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Deja vu.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just as before, a pedestal sat at the center of the room bearing an ornate blue box. At least there weren’t any skeletons this time. Link stepped—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ground shook and the pedestal sunk into the floor. Panels in the far walls opened to reveal three skeletal warriors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Stalfos charged him.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Huffing, Link stood over the remains of his re-dead enemies. Blood oozed from a nasty cut on his forearm, and he was pretty sure he had exhausted his magic reserves. But he was still standing, and they were not. That was a victory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He ignored his aching, protesting muscles and dug through his pack to find bandages, then set to work patching himself up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t looking forward to dragging himself back up the wind tunnel <i>again</i>, but he had little choice if he wanted Fi and Koja to work their magic.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“…and then I bandaged it up and dragged myself back here,” Link finished.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hold still,” Koja said. Link winced as she tightened and snipped the suture. Motes of green swirled around her hand and flowed over the wound. Link grit his teeth and flexed his hand as the flesh knit itself back together. It itched something fierce.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Should hold for now, but do <i>not</i> rip it open again,” she said sternly. “Not unless you want me to have to cut away the extra flesh and sew you back up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grimaced and shook his head vigorously. “Thanks, I won’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Getting a bit bossy over there,” Ryn idly remarked. She was busy stacking a deck of cards together into a structure that vaguely resembled Hyrule Castle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry sweetie,” Koja said with mock affection. “I have no intention of encroaching on your territory.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Bitch</i>,” Ryn muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry—what was that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I said you’re a <i>lovely person</i> and I’m lucky to have you as a friend, even if your views on relationships are ficking stupid,” Ryn clarified. She delicately placed another set of cards on top of the heap, only for a random gust of wind to knock the whole thing over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, so sorry,” Koja said with a deep frown. “I hate when that happens. Better luck next time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn only glared at her as she slowly and deliberately ripped a card into tiny pieces.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…I should go,” Link said, turning to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t worry, my man!” Grenja yelled from behind. “I’ve got things under control here. I’ve been starin’ at the entrance for an hour straight. Ain’t no one gettin’ past me!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… thanks,” Link said awkwardly. “Good job, Grenja.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja gave him a thumbs up.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>What was that noise? Link held his lantern high, trying to make out the shadows at the other end of the dark hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A smaller voidspawn turned to face him—much smaller than the large one in the first room with the Stalfos. With an unnatural <i>hiss!</i>, it opened its maw to reveal rows and rows of jagged teeth. It leapt towards him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wasted no time, running the foul blob-creature through with his sword. As soon as the metal pierced its skin, it burst and vanished in a cloud of dark smoke.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Bloop. Skloop. Splat.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, three more shadow-blobs hopped and blurped towards him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link ran forward, attacking them in quick succession as he pressed further into the darkness. The narrow hall led out into an open room.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Shink!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Bloop. Blorp. Bloop.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The blobthings seemed to be congealing on the walls and falling to the floor.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Blorp. Skloop. Splook.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>There were now six of them. That he could see.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Bloop.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Seven.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link darted down the hallway, seeing light up ahead. He rounded the corner and found a metal door leading to an opening beyond. He tore through and slammed it shut behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There didn’t seem to be any way of securing it from this end. He pressed his ear up against the door to listen, but didn’t hear anything.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hopefully blob-monsters couldn’t open doors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He took a moment to rest and get his bearings. To his right was a massive green cube. Above it on the wall, a mural depicted a man pushing the cube from behind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Experimentally, Link positioned himself behind the cube and gave it a shove. It didn’t budge. He leaned into it and drove it with all his force… and it slid an inch or two.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, that was going to be difficult. What even was the block <i>for</i>?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Walking through a short hall—suspiciously shaped as if to allow a certain object to pass through it—Link found himself in a large open room. A statue of a rabbit sat at the center. On the rabbit’s back was a small, ornate blue box.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, on the far side of the room, were two open archways—again very suspiciously shaped. To the left were two ledges leading upward into other rooms. They weren’t too high—Link could probably climb them if needed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A sudden twitch of movement grabbed his attention. He drew his sword, turning to face—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The rabbit statue flopped its ears and blinked.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Squeak squeak!</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link chased the rabbit through a branching hallway into a long, narrow room, then into a shorter hallway and then into another smaller room with many entrances and exits and then up a ramp and into another long room and then back again to the <i>other</i> room and then back to the branching hallway and then…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stopped to catch his breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait, was this this same hallway as before, or a different one?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span><i>Squeak squeak! Squeak squeak! Squeak squeak!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It was no use. This was too confusing, and the damned thing was just too fast. Every time he tried to approach it or get near, it darted off again. Trying to corner it didn’t work. Trying to surprise it didn’t work.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He’d have to map the place out and think of something clever…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link grunted as he shoved the green block forward another few inches. He had decided to just ignore the rabbit for now. There was a weird shaped metal plate on the floor near what looked to be the way out of this area—if the blue-runed door there was any indication. He was holding out hope that pushing the block on top of the plate would do something. Maybe it would reveal a hidden passageway or do <i>anything</i> to help him with that thrice-damned rabbit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Beads of sweat dripped from his brow as he pushed the block down the last hallway. Almost… there…</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a final shove he slid the block onto the plate.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Click! Fuzz.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The green block vanished. It just… vanished, in a shower of green light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link scratched his head. What did that do? He headed back down the corridor, checking each of the rooms and halls in turn. Nope. Nothing there. Nothing had changed, except—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except the green block was now back exactly where it started. The rabbit chittered and squeaked loudly in the next room over as if to mock him.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link opted for a different approach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Slowly, calmly, he approached the rabbit, slinking down to make himself look less threatening.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey there,” Link said softly. “I don’t want to hurt you. I just want the gem in the chest on your back. Can I have the gem? Please?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Squeak.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uhh… Link wasn’t sure what that meant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll trade you for it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Squeak.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link fished out a bag of shiny pebbles from his pack, then took a step forward. The rabbit’s ear twitched and it crouched like it was about to hop away. Link stopped.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Was that a yes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Squeak squeak.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link waited for a good minute before extending the bag and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—The rabbit turned and hopped off.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link took aim, carefully lining up the shot—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Clink!</i> It harmlessly glanced off the rabbit’s side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>SQUEAK!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Was he just imagining it, or did the rabbit sound offended?</span>
<br><br>
<span>It hopped off into the next room.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Gonna… gonna getcha… this time…” Link said between gasps.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had it now. He was going to push the block down into the hallway and just in front of the metal plate. Then the little bugger would be cornered when he ran that way, and then Link could <i>finally</i> catch it, take the gemstone, and move on from this forsaken place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was all coming together. Just a little further.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The cheeky bastard scampered past him, just out of reach. Link paid it no mind. It was about to get what it had coming.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just wait, you little shit,” he muttered, pausing for a short breather. “I have just the plan for— wait, where are you going? No… nonono—”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Click! Fuzz.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link fell forward onto his hands and knees as the block dematerialized. He punched the ground over and over as inarticulate cries of anguish escaped him.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>It was done. It was finally over!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link cackled like a madman as he held the blue gemstone high in the air above his head. He then slid down to the ground with his back against the green block to catch his breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His eyes fell on the pile of rabbit-rubble near the corner of the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, don’t you look at me like that. You brought this on <i>yourself</i>,” he said accusingly, pointing a finger at the debris. “You have no one to blame but yourself! It didn’t have to end like this, but you made me! I was happy to be friends, but you <i>forced</i> me to… you…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>What in damnation was he saying? Link smacked his forehead, snapping out of it. He needed to get out of here, and fast. He needed to get some fresh air before he lost it.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ragged and weary, Link drug himself up another flight of stairs. He neared the top and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The stairs closed up behind him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The stairs…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Seriously?!</i> How many more trials did he have to go through? Wasn’t the rabbit enough??</span>
<br><br>
<span>He pressed ahead with weapons ready. It wasn’t like there was anywhere else to go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked ahead into an open, dimly-lit room, pausing at the doorway to get an idea of what horrors he was about to face. He rubbed his eyes. No; he wasn’t seeing things—the room was filled with large bones. Gargantuan, oversized bones that looked like they belonged to a creature from a storybook.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was really starting to hate bones.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the center of the room, sitting inside a pentagonal-shaped recess was… a shiny, semi-circular object? Link couldn’t quite make it out from this distance, but one end glowed with a faint green light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Steeling himself, he stepped towards—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Shink!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Predictably, as soon as he set foot into the room, the stone door slid shut behind him. Runes along the walls flared, and an aperture in the ceiling opened. A massive plume of smoke flowed down into the bones.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link took a step back, pressing up against the wall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The bones stirred, rumbled, and swirled about, snapping into place.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Goddess Above.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>In front of him stood a towering skeletal abomination. A… skeletal Hinox? A <i>Stalnox</i>!? The abomination swiveled its head left and right, and its sunken, shadowy eyes fixated on Link.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It lurched forward.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link half-stumbled into base camp from the west, trailing puddles of water. Koja sat by herself on the stairs, tending to her nails. Ryn was lying sprawled out on a bedroll, staring up at the ceiling. Grenja was doing pushups near the entrance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ryn rose to her feet as she noticed him. “Uh, Link…? Why are you soaking wet?” She sounded concerned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Long story,” Link said, wringing water out of his tunic. “I’m fine. Food first. Fi, do the thing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Master.” Fi twirled and danced overhead as ribbons of chromatic vapor settled around him. Link snatched up a piece of jerky and tore into it as he felt his vigor renewed. <i>Mmmmmm.</i> So good.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link?” Ryn repeated. “Why are you wet?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmph.” Link chewed and swallowed. “Because I slid down an aqueduct and landed in a pool of water inside some kind of lounge area just over there.” He pointed back to the living quarters.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Why?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To evade a horde of angry Stalchildren.” Link gave up chewing and swallowed the rest whole, sipping some water to help it down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What the fick, man?” Grenja darted over. “Stal-<i>children</i>?” He paced around, lifting Link’s arm. “Did they bite you? Are you infected?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He swatted Grenja away. “No, I’m just— Hey! Stop that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link—<i>why</i> were you being chased by a horde of angry Stalchildren?” Ryn pressed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I dunno,” Link said plainly. “I ran into them because I was looking for the last block to solve the puzzle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There’s this puzzle in the sandpit room with a bunch of block-shaped holes at the bottom—I think I mentioned that, right? Well anyway, the blocks that fit into the holes are spread all throughout the structure. Now that I have the transfabrulator, I’ve gotta go all over the place and retrace my steps through the trials so I can take the blocks back there and solve the puzzle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Blocks? Trans—what?” Ryn shook her head in confusion. “Link, slow down. What’s a <i>trans… fabricator</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link unhooked the metalic half-circle device from his belt. It fit comfortably in his palm. He held it up for them to inspect, flat side facing outward. The runes on its surface glowed faintly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Well I’ll be,</i>” Grenja said slowly. He whistled, giving Link a soft pat on the back. “I can’t believe you actually found it! Nice going, man. I always knew you had it in you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?” Koja said, scurrying over. “What’d he find?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll, uh, let you tell her, Link,” Grenja said. “You earned it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked to Koja. She rolled her eyes and shook her head, waving a hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi calls it a transfabrulator,” Link said. “Whatever that means. Bit of a mouthful if you ask me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Some kind of ancient Lightsworn artifact, I take it?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “Yeah, probably.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Looks neat,” Koja said, bending over to get a good look. “What’s it do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link smiled with a glint in his eye. “Just watch,” he said. On the side of the device, he selected the cube from the six options corresponding to the six perfect solids. He aimed away from the group and squeezed the handle. A perfectly-shaped green cube materialized where he pointed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Koja gaped at him wordlessly, doing a double take.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wow,” Grenja said. “Er—never thought I’d see it up close.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh-huh,” Ryn said dubiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s not all,” Link said with a grin. He flipped a toggle-switch near his thumb and pointed off at a wall in the distance. He gave the device a firm squeeze and the cube went flying towards the wall with incredible speed.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><b>CRASH!</b> Clunk-tink!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It hit the wall with absurd force, causing everyone to flinch as a veritable thunderclap reverberated through the hall. Link had tested it—the blocks the device made were every bit as heavy as the one in… that place.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He checked back with his companions. The three of them stood in wordless awe. Link tapped the front of the device and the block <i>fuzzed</i>, warping away with a shower of light.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I want one,” Grenja said, breaking the silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, bro. Like there’s going to be a whole pile of them just lying around,” Koja said sarcastically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just the one, unfortunately,” Link affirmed. “I mean, as far as I know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, are you sure you should be slamming it into the walls like that?” Grenja asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…No,” Link said with a weak smile, rubbing his neck. “But I checked—the walls seem pretty solid and it didn’t even leave a scratch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Still…” Koja said uneasily.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, I’ll keep the potential catastrophes to a minimum,” Link said. “Promise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Where <i>did</i> you find it, anyway?” Ryn asked.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“—Wait, was this before or after the rabbit?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>I do not want to talk about the rabbit</i>,” Link said, trying and failing to keep the tension out of his voice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, okay!” Ryn said with a laugh, holding her hands up. “Sorry, won’t mention it again. So did you get that block you were after?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head. “Nope, but I found this.” He put away the transfabrulator and took out a weighty green gemstone from a pouch at his side. “I’m not sure where the matching door is yet, and I still have go back for the block. Just thought I’d stop by and rest up before trying again. Speaking of—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link took in a deep breath and stretched, bouncing on the balls of his feet to get his blood pumping. “I should probably get going if I want to make any more progress before I need to sleep,” he said. He waved to Ryn, turning to go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t take too long,” Ryn said, flopping back down on her bedroll. “At this rate I’m going to die of boredom. …If Koja doesn’t kill me first.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait—hold up,” Koja called out from behind. “Remind me, why’d you need the block again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stopped and pivoted. “To solve the puzzle?” he answered. “So I can get whatever’s in that chest—the one in the sandpit room.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had every expectation the chest just held another gemstone, but there was no reason to pass it up. It would probably be required later on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh-huh.” Koja said flatly. “The chest behind the iron bars, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Yes?” Link answered uncertainly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The chest behind the iron bars with an ominous sandstorm pit nearby, containing a puzzle that is almost certainly a trap?” Koja clarified.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yep</i>, that’d be the one,” Link said, his patience slipping.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And have you thought to avoid the trap by just <i>breaking through the bars</i>?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, of course,” Link said. “That was the first…” He trailed off as his thoughts caught up to him. He glanced down to the transfabrulator on his belt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Oh.”</span>
<br><br>
