<span>Drained. Empty. Like she was piloting a soulless shell.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This is how Zelda felt at times such as these.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She’d lost count of the number of times she had to slip away to her study, or elsewhere as the situation permitted. To weep silently, or to cry and scream and break things, venting her anger and rage at the unjustness in the world. She knew she was not alone. The faces of everyone around her spoke the same truth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everything seemed to be going so well! But that’s how it always went. Some momentum here, and a swift swift smack to the face immediately thereafter. This was no different. The war with the Blin was coming to a close—and sure, there were all these other issues to contend with on the side (with more and more cropping up over time)—but damnation if they weren’t on the verge of returning to something approaching normalcy! They were making undeniable progress! The second Blin warlord had been slain, and the main army, lead by the Lord General himself, were on the cusp of retaking Talus and stemming the Blight for good.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Only for the impossible to happen, and for her people to be facing an unstoppable onslaught all over again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except this time it was infinitely worse. Not even the fifteen meter tall, five meter thick fortifications that were the walls of Castletown could protect against weapons that could cleave through metal as easily as through air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They needed a miracle. Again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda breathed a deep breath. Patience. Focus.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite it all, she knew she could not be seen to waver in front of her people. She couldn’t be seen to be weak. The face she would present, even to those closest to her, would be one of resolution and determination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I am <i>Queen</i> Zelda Numenia Proventia Hyrule, and I <i>will</i> lead my people.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The words stirred something deep within, filling her with warmth and determination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda wiped her face clean, inspected herself in the mirror, and climbed the ladder to the top of the guard tower.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>She watched from Castletown’s central guard tower as mages trained at her orders, led by the Order of Sages and various monks who directed them according to Zelda’s instructions. Mentally, she likenened herself to a perched loftwing; an ever-present symbol to remind her people that she was watching, and that she was with them still. As much as it was possible to convey that image, she tried. The entire world was on fire—at least according to each and every one of her subjects and advisors who constantly sought her attention—and of course each of them had a different idea about what was the most pressing emergency.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite all that, here she stood. Resolute and impassive. Doing her best to be a beacon of hope, despite everything they had to endure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda was immensely thankful to have worked out enough of her issues with High Priestess Vestele that she could rely on her and High Bishop Rharu to coordinate the research attempts. They were not on the best of terms due to differing ideologies, but the priestess did not allow those differences to get in the way here, even though she very easily could have. Zelda knew full well it was a foolhardy endeavor at best, and she needed all the help she could get to see it through. Mentally, she remembered to thank Vestele personally for this should she get the chance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Notwithstanding it’s relative depopulation, Castletown continued to be a bustling hub of activity. The entire market district had been appropriated for this task. Not that there was much to be done in the way of “appropriation”; the city had been all but emptied of residents, merchants, vagrants, and everyone else—all of whom long since fled to Kakariko or other relatively safe havens in the western countryside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All around her, soldiers worked hurriedly to make preparations for the coming siege, and to accommodate those yet to arrive: the rest of the mages and then the southern forces—scheduled merely a day and a half ahead of the main army, with the Blin hot on their heels. Only a few dozen mages had arrived so far, but they were expecting many more in the days to come. A couple thousand, at least—though most of those wouldn’t be here until a day or two before Wymar and his forces, thus putting a hard limit on the different avenues of research that could be explored.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s lips drew to a line.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was not ideal. Not ideal at all. She would give anything for another week to prepare. But they did not have that time. Six days is all they had to learn everything they could from the manuscripts Link found at the Obsidian Spire—and not even that much! Care needed to be taken because of regeneration, and the ever-present problem of magical scarcity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a delicate balancing act. Using magic was wholly necessary for exploratory research… and for logistics and siege preparations… but no matter what, the mages absolutely had to be in fighting shape for when the Blin arrived. And each mage had their own talents and capacities at that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It would be a nightmare to coordinate everything in anything approaching an optimal fashion. As it was, they simply assigned each incoming mage to one of three groups (after sorting based on color), depending on their skill, affinity, and capacity. The first group—those with the highest skill—were directed to do freeform exploratory research after being debriefed according to their color’s expectations. The second group—those with the highest affinities regardless of skill—were directed to assist the first group in whatever manner they needed, but only to attempt the most promising avenues and techniques after the first group was spent. The last group—everyone else—was to serve in an advisory capacity only, and to function as magical batteries for the first and second groups.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Essentially, the first group charted the course, the second explored the most promising options given they could do so most efficiently, and the third expanded the range of the other two. Mages with multiple affinities were asked to exercise their best discretion, and to shift between color camps as they saw fit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once again, it was not in any way approaching ideal, but it was the best Zelda and her advisors could come up with on short notice, striking a balance between getting things done and not wasting so much effort on trying to solve the coordination problem that they ate into progress.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Zelda herself was in the second group of the blue camp. As such, she would pursue the most promising avenues there, unless something in the Red or Green camps proved that much more enticing.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>The tower hatch swung open suddenly, startling Zelda out of her reverie and nearly off the parapet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chancellor Taetus. (He was a Chancellor now, she had to remind herself.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, my apologies,” he said at once. “I did not mean to startle you, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ever perceptive, that man. Zelda waved it aside. “No worries. Deep in thought, is all. Is there something that requires my attention?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus proffered an open hand. “I have good news, for a change.” He smirked. “I am to understand that Golvara has made it safely through enemy territory, and is expected to arrive at Hylia’s Watch three days hence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda paused, then nodded. She had to remind herself that Taetus and the others had not yet heard this news. She had only just heard it from Shesan the evening prior.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She supposed she should loop in Taetus at some point. She questioned however if now was the best time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unfortunately,” he continued somberly, “two of his escort and one of our Sheikah lost their lives during the exfiltration mission. Goddesses rest their souls.” He hung his head as he said the words.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded grimly. She would see to it that the deaths of these brave souls, and all others who gave their lives in service of her kingdom—of the entire world—would be honored, in time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Assuming they survived the coming siege, at any rate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sighed. There still remained the question of what to do with this news. So much had transpired since then, it had nearly slipped her mind. Golvara bore a fragment of Wisdom. A priceless artifact, though not one that would be immediately useful, aside from keeping it out of the hands of the enemy. Not from Zelda’s understanding at least—five fragments total would be necessary to clarify her dreams, which she felt was by far the most useful of her powers. Her abilities to communicate or scry at a distance hadn’t even worked since Impa’s passing—and there were none in her life who could fill Impa’s shoes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned her eye eastward, to the horizon. In the direction of the approaching onslaught. The blight would be upon them before anyone could make it from Hylia’s Watch to Castletown—and even then, would Castletown be the safest place for another fragment?</span>
<br><br>
<span>No. Not by a long shot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus cleared his throat, bringing Zelda’s attention back to the present. “Shall I send word to Hylia’s Watch, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>In her periphery, Father’s ring on Taetus’ finger caught her eye as he thumbed it idly, waiting for her response. Zelda rubbed a finger over her own ring—another of Father’s—the signet ring empty of its jewel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shook her head. “Let them know the message has been received, and that we are contemplating the best course of action. See to it that Golvara and his escort are given a hero’s welcome—as much as that is possible given the circumstances—and for all involved to await further orders.” She met Taetus’ eyes, then glanced back over the grounds. “There is much on my mind, and I will need to meet with you and my other advisors before I am sure of how to proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus saluted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—And thank you, Chancellor Taetus, for everything. Despite our differences, I have come to rely on your expertise, and to count on you as a true friend. Goddesses guide your steps.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus paused briefly, before giving a humble bow. “It is an honor to serve our kingdom, Your Grace. I shall see your will done.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He left, leaving Zelda to her thoughts.</span>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
    <span>Efforts to Recreate Lost Knowledge from the Obsidian Spire</span>
</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>10th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>We are just getting started, so the lack of progress is to be expected. Several of the Blue mages expressed interest in Coldstepping, though none present have been able to come close to replicating the technique. I of course tried it myself with the assistance of Fi overcharging my reserves. Unfortunately, I haven’t the athleticism to make use of it, despite sometimes being able to conjure stable footholds in midair.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps Izu will be better able to make use of the technique? It seems to require something like the entirety of my reserves and half that again, so we shall have to see. I note once again that I possess by far the greatest blue affinity in the kingdom. Perhaps with a month or two to train, some of our more skilled mages could…</span>
<br><br>
<span>But I digress. I’ve directed the Blue mages to look elsewhere in their research, lest we waste all our magic on a technique clearly outside of any of our grasp for the time being.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We had the red mages begin practicing katas with weapons. There have been several injuries—some quite severe—though no progress. Holding weapons while under the effects of Invigorate is, as I was forewarned, a recipe for disaster. I wonder how Link managed to master this technique overnight? Clearly it was related to his status as a Lightsworn—a gift from the Goddesses themselves. If only we could find a way to create additional Lightsworn…</span>
<br><br>
<span>I put a halt on these tests for now. It’s simply too dangerous to proceed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Still a few days remain. I hold out hope that we may yet find our ace in the hole.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>It pains me, but I cannot in my mind separate all this ancient knowledge from the memory of those who purchased said knowledge with their lives.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Arlinkar, Grenja, Koja, Ryn. The Crown and all of Hyrule thanks you for your service. You will forever be missed.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>11th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>No meaningful progress, and what’s worse, I have a million other things pressing for my attention. Let us hope tomorrow is better for results.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just for good measure, I’ve directed about ten percent of the mages of each color to work on trying to recreate elemental rods. We’ll see how the progress goes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I spoke briefly with Shesan. She has some interesting theories on the nature of magic, but nothing immediately applicable. She maintains that she does not know specifics of “our” magic any more than we do, though claims that it is but one expression of a more fundamental phenomenon inherent to many worlds. She terms it “innate multi-shard end-positive intent-focused investiture.” I have no idea what any of that means, and the examples she shared are, frankly, confusing and alien.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If ever I have more time, I would love to pick her brain on this subject.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>12th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>More on Red magic: no mage has been able to achieve a partial Transformation. I am told by every single expert on the subject that they believe the tales in the recovered manuscripts to be just that—tales. As it is, it takes many months, if not <i>years</i> to master Transformation. Those capable of such are scarcely willing to try a partial Transformation, and of those none have had any success.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It does appear that substantial Healing can in fact reverse Transformation. This is useful knowledge to be sure, though not immediately applicable. Common practice of such may reduce the widespread fear and mysticism regarding the technique in time. But again, time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Absolutely zero progress has been made with respect to Stasis. Even the most learned red mages have no clue how to proceed here. Vestele assures me this has been a subject of intense scrutiny for decades, if not centuries. Even given our relative excess of magic and willingness to spend it, our most skilled red mages are still left clueless. We will need more information if any progress is to be made here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With regard to Blue magic, it’s difficult not to dismiss some parts of the transcripts as more fanciful tales. The ability to turn foes’ blood to acid? Seriously?? I wish I could do that!</span>
<br><br>
<span>The use of Telepathy in conjunction with attacks is a well-known tactic, and common military doctrine besides. It seems little is to be gained here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As with Invigorate-with-weapons, using Scry during a fight seems to be similarly reckless. I can hardly believe this was once considered not only a viable technique, but <i>the</i> defining characteristic of Blue-enhanced fighters. It is simply baffling how far we have fallen in terms of magical knowledge and ability.</span>
<br><br>
<span>More fanciful tales, or lost knowledge? The ever-present question.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What is to be said of Green magic? The experts among them assure me that there is nothing new to be had with the accounts of Healing magic. Additionally, I am told that Soothe has precisely zero combat potential, despite any assertions to the contrary. It simply requires too much time and too much magic to be used in an offensive capacity. It is best relegated to more subtle applications on unwary foes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As well, we have had a substantial number of Green mages attempting to use Luck in unconventional ways as laid out by Master Zobor’s accounts. I can’t say there’s been much of any progress here, either. Master Zobor’s <i>Opportunity</i> may as well be a completely different type of magic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Which makes some sort of sense, given the difference in name. I have to wonder how this came to be? His descriptions of its use are also at odds with common understanding of Luck. Specifically, he seems much more blaise about actually relying on it, while subtly implying that he’s not relying on it at all and that instead it’s all down to his own skill and prowess. Sort of—a mindset of knowing it’s there but assuming ahead of time that victory is all but assured? I wonder if that’s an important component?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Regardless, it’s difficult to measure “progress” of any sort in this area. How does one measure precisely how much more “lucky” one green mage is from another? How does one measure the difference between a single green mage, given the ill-defined nature of “changing mindsets” and the vague direction they’ve been given? In absolute terms, the difference in martial outcomes we’ve seen does not appear to be worth speaking of.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What else? The interplay between Foretelling and Luck is well known, but not well understood. I’ve directed the first group of both the Blue and Green camps to explore this in more detail with their remaining time. If we learn something groundbreaking there, that may actually give us a leg up over the Blin, who have their own mages making use of both techniques.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i><u>13th of First Flows:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I am at a loss. No results worth mentioning, and the main army is due the day after tomorrow!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hylia help us. I cannot bring myself to admit this entire venture has been in vain.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“<i>It’s not enough!</i>” Zelda slammed her fists on the table as Malg finished his report, drawing glances and stunned silence from those present. She drew in a breath, then composed herself through grit teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The best they had seen over the past few days was when a man named Zamere, a young and talented green Mage, managed to deflect seven arrows in a row with his quarterstaff before taking one to the chest and another to the knee. His injuries required extensive Healing—and would see him out of the coming fight to boot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Zamere was very insistent the arrows did not need to be blunted, for the purposes of demonstrating the power of his raw talent.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Few other Greens seemed foolhardy enough to try anything as reckless—and who would blame them? Even if there was more to Luck than was commonly known, it would take far more than a few days for skilled practitioners to incorporate new applications in meaningful capacity. Zelda was reminded of her training with Izu and Oboe what seemed a lifetime ago. Izu had warned her against ever attempting a technique in a real fight that she wasn’t already comfortable with. That much was plainly and painfully applicable here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That aside, Blue mages with some training were beginning to reliably detect and break Luck effects with minimal magic expenditure. It was <i>something</i>, sure, but it was not nearly enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is there nothing we haven’t tried?” Abbot Marketh inquired. A stern man with black hair showing patches of grey at the sides. He was a high ranking Seeker, and the leader of the Red camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed to herself as she looked over the faces of those present. No one had anything else to offer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Besides Marketh, Laylith, Malg, and Shesan, there were also two sages present, as well as High Bishop Rharu—Vestele’s husband and the man responsible for the day-to-day organization and logistics of the Faith. He currently acted as the de-facto leader of the research efforts under Zelda’s direction. The other sages were Sage Chalia, in charge of the Green camp, and Sage Vulas, in charge of the Blue camp. Chalia was an older woman (though admittedly still young for a sage), who Zelda had previously met at the Temple of Time. Vulas was one of two Zora sages who intermittently travelled Hylian lands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Everything points back to the decline theory,” Shesan offered. “Is that not clear enough? I feel it has been more than borne out by the results. Your magic was once more powerful—or perhaps individuals were more capable of wielding it than they are now—and since antiquity, its power has waned and knowledge of its use has been lost.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took everything Zelda had to not tear into that woman with everyone else present. How could she not see—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…I realize this does not help matters presently,” Shesan said guardedly, seeming to register Zelda’s ire, “but we cannot change facts, no matter how many mages we throw at the problem. I simply mean to suggest that perhaps we are going about this the wrong way. Rather than trying to recover lost arts overnight, perhaps we should instead be looking to devise tactics and stratagems to help with the coming battle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah,” Malg said dryly. “So we should instead seek to overhaul military doctrine overnight. Is that right?” He turned fractionally and raised an eyebrow in Shesan’s general direction. The table broke out into quiet murmurs, and before long there was yet another heated argument between him and Marketh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pinched the bridge of her nose. Curse everything. Curse the enemy, curse their lack of knowledge, curse the Blights, curse Shesan and her decided lack of usefulness, curse the Blin and their stupid ficking Soulsteel, and curse all the time they didn’t have!</span>
<br><br>
<span>She let out a breath, then met Laylith’s eyes briefly before sinking back into her seat and gazing up at the ceiling. She had to remind herself that it was scarcely two months ago she was in this very room fighting for funding for far less ambitious projects than anything they had done in the past week.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmph. If only her problems today were as simple as setting up Blindscrier networks.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>But actually…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda tapped her chin, then took a sip of tea. Idly, she wondered if that plan had been implemented even a year ago, how many more Blue mages would be available to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—She spat her tea all over the table and jumped from her seat, immediately drawing worried glances from everyone. She pointed at Marketh, who sat closest to the door. “Have the mages cease training! Everyone. Tell them to stop!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace?” Rharu said in a worried tone. “Are you okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>So help me</i>, if you do not move your arse right this second—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At once, Your Grace!” Marketh barked, leaping out of his seat to follow her orders.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Uh, Your Grace?” Laylith said. “What’s this about?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda grinned a wicked and knowing grin as she let the mood settle. It was not every day she got to do this. She strode casually from one side of the table to the other, before placing both hands upon it and leaning forward conspiratorially.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What do you think would happen if you had half the Blue mages in the kingdom all send messages to the same person at the same time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Dead silence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was Shesan who responded first, with cackling laughter. “Clever. Very clever.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sage Vulas looked between them, before his eyes opened wide in understanding.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…That, huh,” Laylith said aloud, scrunching up her face. “That could… in this specific instance… that could work, yeah?” She glanced at Malg, who nodded in return.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sage Chalia and High Bishop Rharu exchanged glances. “Mind cluing us in?”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda snuck away from the feast hall and stepped out onto a balcony for some much needed solitude. The festivities were nice and all, but the constant presence gatherings such as these required always proved too much for her in the end.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She took in a long, calming breath of fresh air under the stars as she contemplated their next steps. Aside from continuing to gather more fragments of the Triforce, an obvious next move would be to have Izu visit the locations from Arlinkar’s dreams in order to gain more understanding about the ancient Lightsworn order—and with luck the secrets to becoming one himself. Aside from that, the Zora still needed aid in reclaiming their homeland, and there was also the matter of upholding her ancestors’ blood oath to the Gor—</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stumbled mid-thought. How had she gotten here? This was… was this real? There was no way this was real. She held her hand in front of her face, inspecting it closely. It certainly <i>seemed</i> real. She pinched herself, and felt a slight tinge of pain.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Zelda, my child,</i>” a soft voice spoke. “<i>Take heed and listen: for more is at stake than you know…</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her awareness fell away as she was engulfed by utter darkness. A single mote of red, outlined in gold and wreathed in black flames shone in the distance. She moved towards it, and it expanded rapidly to encompass her entire field of view, until she was caught up in the center of a great eye that felt as if it were staring into her soul from every direction at once. She felt as if no facet of her being could be hidden from this terrible and awesome presence.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The eye blinked, and two amber eyes opened in its place. Hylian eyes? No… <i>Gerudo.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Light shone from above as golden rays broke through the clouds, illuminating a figure clad in black and gold armor. The High King of the Gerudo stood atop a tower of bones, wearing a golden crown with a ruby-red gem at its center. Ganondorf loomed over the entire world, with his eyes set firmly on Hyrule castle. He raised a gauntleted fist, which bore the mark of the full Triforce of Power.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In response to his will, a sandstorm rose from the desert and washed over her kingdom, leaving naught but desolation in its wake. A blood-red moon rose over the horizon, and the entire world was once again engulfed in darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda blinked and found herself sitting upright in her bed. Her heart thumped hard in her chest and she struggled to catch her breath.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She swallowed hard. If that was a dream, it certainly hadn’t felt like one.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>A lone rider rode hard towards Castletown at sunset, bearing a flag with the winged-shield crest of the City Guard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Guard Captain Izu.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith immediately set down her spyglass and made her way down to meet him at the northeastern gate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The portcullis rose at her command and swiftly slammed shut as Izu made it through. He hopped from a winded horse, which promptly collapsed as Izu strode over to meet her. He had made it in record time from the Floodplains; Laylith would be surprised if his horse survived overnight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Queen?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith nodded, gesturing ahead. “This way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was precious little time to waste. She guided him through the Abmont district and the winding cobbled paths leading towards the heart of the city. They moved at a brisk pace, as fast as possible while still holding conversation. The streets were mostly empty, but those they passed gave them a wide berth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We plan to ambush the Warlord at an opportune moment,” Laylith relayed, “and as you have no doubt heard, the Queen wishes you to spearhead the strike.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded. “Parameters?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The edge of her mouth curled in a grin. Not a single thought for himself. Captain Izu’s loyalty was second to none. She always admired that about him. Sturdy and steadfast; one who lived his life as a boulder in the midst of a rushing stream.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Much is yet to be determined,” she said. “Pending intelligence and circumstance of the Blin army’s arrival, the exact means will be left to your discretion. All the resources we have are at your disposal—yours to do with as you see fit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He grunted his assent as they made their way up a stone staircase that wound around the inner walls. “Any news from Arlinkar and his team?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative.” Laylith responded. Izu grunted again, and left it at that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith sighed. She couldn’t take any more of this. She held out a hand, stopping him in place. “Listen, Izu: How you choose to handle this is up to you, but I want you to know that I am here for you if you need me. In any capacity. No matter what, I’ve got your back. Through thick and thin—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—’till the very end,” he finished. He met her eyes, firm and resolute, and gave a single nod. He reached out an arm and Laylith took it in a firm embrace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He opened his mouth to speak again, but only swallowed before turning ahead. “Best not keep them waiting, yeah? The Queen needs you at her side.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Damnation, this man. Couldn’t he at least tell her no?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith smiled with a minute shake of her head. They continued on, and a minute later were at the central guardhouse. The guards posted there made way, and the duo ascended to find Queen Zelda in the middle of a meeting with Vestele, Rhauru, Shesan, and a few others. Laylith hung back as Izu approached and saluted, standing at arms.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My Queen!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Captain Izu!” Zelda said warmly, interrupting herself midstream. She paused, no doubt collecting her words. “All of Hyrule thanks you for answering the call to service. You have the Crown’s blessing, and my eternal gratitude.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu knelt before her. “It is the greatest honor to serve my kingdom, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded and turned away for a spell, no doubt to hide her emotions. Laylith knew her well. Despite the facade she presented to everyone else, sending Izu on this mission pained her deeply.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith would need to talk with her later to ensure she didn’t keep it bottled up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stood tall, then turned and approached the captain. “Captain Izu,” the Queen said, “you have your orders. I would mark you as an agent of the Goddess Hylia, and name you as my personal champion. Do you accept?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aye, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fi appeared in front of them and danced around the pair, streaming trails of divine magic in her wake. A moment later, and the ritual concluded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Arise, Izu, as the Queen’s Champion.” He did so. “I trust Laylith has filled you in on the details?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith spoke up, raising a finger. “I hadn’t yet got to the BMOTS,” she said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…BMOTS?” Izu asked inquisitively.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Blue Magus Overwhelming Telepathic Strike</i>,” Zelda said. “Should you—” she cleared her throat. “<i>When</i> you engage the Warlord, we will have every Blue mage at our disposal using Telepathy offensively in a coordinated fashion. It is my hope that this should all but ensure your swift and decisive victory. Preliminary testing suggests the technique to be most effective as a debilitating tactic.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu’s eyes widened in surprise. He shot a glance back to Laylith, then turned again to the Queen. “That’s… wow. Yeah. That is an absolute, unmitigated stroke of genius, Your Grace. Your plan, I presume?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised a hand to her mouth, suppressing a laugh. “Thank you, Izu, though you need not flatter me. Yes, the plan was mine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu let out a hearty guffaw. “Well then, what are we waiting for?! Let’s get ready to send this Warlord to meet his maker!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The rest of those present cheered as he turned to encourage them. Laylith couldn’t help but smile and join in with muted claps of her own. </span>
<br><br>
<span>The Queen continued. “Just outside, towards the market district, is a contingent of the most skilled Blue mages in the kingdom, ready to share with you all they’ve learned from manuscripts recovered from ancient Lightsworn training grounds. Or at least, what we’ve managed to recover in the short time we’ve had available to us. Fi—the Emissary of the Goddess Hylia—will assist you with whatever you may need, and Laylith and the others will fill you in on the remaining details.” She stepped over and took his hand, giving it a gentle kiss. “Go with my blessing, Champion Izu. We will meet again soon to prepare for your mission, once the Lord General arrives.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command, Your Grace!” Izu saluted sharply, then turned to leave. He gave Laylith a nod on his way out, and she turned to follow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Despite the incredible danger ahead, she wished with all her heart that could be there with him, on the off chance that the tale of Izu the Magnificent was about to make its way into the history books. She would love nothing more than to be part of something so grand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu was right, though; Laylith’s place was at the Queen’s side.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>From Grandmistress Lyr’s accounting, Blue mages of antiquity such as Farin the Fearless were a marvel to behold in action. The mere thought of anyone mastering the technique of Coldstepping to the degree described in those manuscripts sent chills down Izu’s spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was a practical man, however, and he knew full well that neither he nor anyone else in the kingdom would ever approach that level of mastery—not even if the youngest, most talented mage spent the better part of their natural lifetime training. Gone were the days of legendary warriors—barring more literal divine intervention at any rate, and banking on that would not exactly be the wisest move, to put it delicately.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But again, Izu was nothing if not a practical man. He did not need to <i>master</i> the technique. He merely needed to pull off one good trick, to help him win one duel. As for divine intervention? He had the next best thing: the assistance of Fi.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So then the question became: how to use Coldstepping most effectively? An aggressive, frontal assault would be worthless—even attacking from above would not offer him much advantage other than a momentary surprise. No; he’d have to get in, underneath his enemy’s guard, and then surprise the Blin Warlord with a trick he could not possibly expect.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was the idea, at least. Theory always proved messy in practice. This was no exception.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To preserve magic, Izu set up static rigging to give him the footholds needed to perform the maneuver. Run. Foretelling. Avoid and duck. Get inside guard. Leap. Spring off his right foot into a crouch, and then leap into a somersault that would carry him in an arc above his target.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu practiced the movement a dozen times, adjusted the rigging here and there, and then practiced a dozen times more with soldiers swinging at him, until he felt confident he could pull off the trick in a real fight. Only then did he practice using magic, and not even his own at first. There were plenty of other mages with stronger affinities around, and so he had them focus on creating the requisite two footholds in precisely the right locations at precisely the right times.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even then, it took six such mages working in concert. Four to supply the reserves, and one for each foothold. Unlike himself, they could not be augmented by Fi—not without severe losses in efficiency from her unique magical conversion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Result: two attempts, two successes. With the live-magic practice down, and having proved the efficacy of the technique to himself, only then did he move to using his own reserves.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Focus. Breathe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu fell into stance, then darted forward. His opponent, armed with a halberd. went for an overhead strike that left him precious little room to maneuver.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No matter; he saw the path he needed to take four steps in advance. The first step held short. The second dug in. The third redirected, and the fourth brought him in a heartbeat after the swing cleared.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mentally, he prepared himself for the vertigo he knew he was about to experience. He focused his magic, summoning a foothold.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Leap. Mind becomes blank; empty.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Breathe.</i> Bank. Float.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A sudden infusion of magic cascaded throughout his being, and Izu summoned the second foothold immediately thereafter, curling up and springing from it with all his might.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The trajectory carried him in an arc over his opponent. A tap to the head with his training sword concluded the test.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The men and women around him erupted into cheers as Izu landed and recovered. Several took the occasion to swarm him, crying out wildly at his success. Aside from an easy smile and a thumbs-up, he paid them no mind, staying focused on the task at hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s not all, folks,” he said loudly over the throng. “Back in position! I want to try it a couple more times before we call it quits.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Begrudgingly, they obeyed his commands. A new sparring partner lined up across from him. This man was a few inches taller than the last, and had greater reach. His weapon of choice: the waraxe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu took his own place and nodded. The man returned the gesture, signalling he was ready to begin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Three deep, calm breaths to center himself. Izu lined up the attack and charged. His opponent took his best swing, but Izu’s magically augmented instincts carried him under the axehead with a slight crouch and a roll of his left shoulder. Shoving into his opponent for extra momentum, he launched himself forward and summoned the first of the two footholds to spring off of.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Leap, bank, second hold, crouch, <i>jump</i>! He adjusted the angle slightly, this time turning to clear the back of his opponent, who was left wide-open for a coup de grâce.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perfection. Once again, all those around let out cries of encouragement. Izu acknowledged them with a wave, but wasted no time setting up for a third and final attempt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His last sparring partner was a squat and bulky man, wielding a greatsword. Just as before, Izu lined up and nodded. His partner thrust his sword into the air, then adopted a high guard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Deep breath. Despite himself, Izu’s mind felt clouded. He was beginning to feel the edges of exhaustion pressing in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No matter. This was the last attempt. He had to make it count.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He dropped into stance and bolted forward. This time his opponent opted to observe Izu and wait to attack until the last second.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hah. That was a fatal mistake. Every step carried Izu closer to his target, pruning off possibilities of attack until precious few remained. Izu got just within range, feinted a half-step, then closed before the man could react. Izu pressed his own sword into the man to create distance in passing (nevermind the damage such a drawing attack could inflict), and set himself up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Summon, leap—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Vertigo.</i> Even with Fi overcharging his reserves, the expenditure left him feeling drained and disoriented. Then came a sudden surge of energy midair as she infused him with even more magic!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Second foothold. Izu coiled his legs and <i>sprung</i>, but struck at the wrong angle. The result? He didn’t “somersault,” so much as lunge backward and crash into his training partner, knocking them both to the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Frustration. If that were the Blin Warlord, he would currently be having his skull caved in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu sighed, then dusted himself off and helped his partner to his feet. Result: two successes, one failure. And he desperately needed to rest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He supposed he could call upon Fi to restore his energy as he had seen her do several times on the road with Zelda and Arlinkar, but even if he did so… this was it. All the magic they had budgetted for. Every bit that could be spared for this training session had been spent. Any more, and they risked cutting into siege preparation or not having enough for the actual fight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu was not entirely happy with the results, but it was something. A trick to keep in his back pocket, should he need it. Goddesses willing, the BMOTS would be enough. But if it wasn’t?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The question remained: how much of a margin did he need to leave himself? If he could pull off the Coldstep maneuver mid-fight, it would all-but guarantee his victory.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But so would the BMOTS. That was, if the timing worked out in his favor and everything went according to plan. But that was in fact a risk, and a practical man did not leave anything to chance when the fate of the entire kingdom hung in the balance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Should he attempt Coldstepping in the duel, he might succeed. Or he could royally screw it up, getting himself killed in the process and leaving the city to burn and tens of thousands to die.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu looked to the sky, entirely ignoring those around him. Dawn was approaching, and a single day remained. He would think on it. For now, he decided to rest.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“The plan <i>will</i> work, Wymar! You don’t have to worry about me!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I fully acknowledge the merits of this plan of yours,” the Lord General said. “However, I cannot in good conscience allow you to remain here during the siege. Even if Izu succeeds, we have no idea what the hordes will do—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—My place is here, with my people!” Zelda said fiercely. “I will not run scared when they need me most!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Please,</i> Zelda, you must see reason! This is not a matter of appearances—it is my solemn duty to ensure your survival. No matter what transpires, our kingdom will still need its Queen to lead it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As if there will be a kingdom to lead if Castletown falls!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>As soon as the words left her mouth, Zelda regretted having spoken them. Even if only top military brass were present, she could stand to be more discerning. Normally she would be more given to consideration, but in this moment she felt hot and flustered, her blood boiling with anger and frustration. No matter what Wymar said, she couldn’t give in. Couldn’t he see—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace?” a messenger boy interrupted their row, approaching her and the Lord General sheepishly.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Oh damnation,</i> Zelda thought. Where did he come from?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Forgive me,” the boy continued, “but we have an esteemed guest… he, uh…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gasped as a living, breathing Goron strode up the stairs to the ramparts, gently pushing the messenger aside as he passed. He had dark, rust-colored skin painted with runic tattoos, and stood a hulking two and a half meters tall. His body was covered in patches of rocky, crystalline outgrowths, with dense, thicker clusters in place of hair along his back, head, arms, and hands. His proportions varied substantially from Hylians, with massive forearms and upper body in comparison to his relatively small legs—even if said legs were as thick as Zelda’s waist.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She placed a hand on her chest. Marvelous. Beautiful. Breathtaking. Here, a <i>Goron</i> stood before her—true to life, straight out of the history books!</span>
<br><br>
<span>She realized all too late that she was gawking, and rushed ahead to meet the envoy with a slight bow of her head. “It is an honor, esteemed Brother! Thank you for travelling all this way. I wish only that we could have met under better circumstances.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The honor is mine, goro!” the Goron said, striking a fearsome pose with both arms raised, showing off his immaculately sculpted musculature.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda could not help but admire this creature. So rugged, and yet… somehow gentle, all the same.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am Kenak,” the Goron said, introducing himself. “And I have come to deliver a message from our tribes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please, by all means,” Zelda said. “We Hylians welcome you and your people as our own.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We hear your warning regarding Ganondorf, the Exiled King,” Kenak said. “The Council of Elders recognizes the threat this man and the powers he serves poses to our realm. As in ages past, we Gorons will stand with the Hylians, so long as you—Zelda, Queen—are willing to uphold the blood-oath your ancestors swore to mine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly. She was expecting as much. She had no idea what “upholding the blood-oath” entailed, but… did she have any other option?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lord General! Your Grace!” a messenger called out, reaching the top of the stairs, winded. “The Blin! They’ve arrived, and are encircling the city!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Right on cue, or thereabouts.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sound the horns! You have your orders, men!” Wymar barked. “Get to it!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All around them, soldiers scrambled to action.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I must again thank you, Kenak, for travelling all this way,” Zelda said hurriedly. “As you have just heard, our capital is beset by the Blin army, wielding weapons of nightmare. Soulsteel, capable of tearing through armor, weapons, and fortifications with ease.” She paused, gathering her thoughts. She could feel her heart thumping in her chest. There was so much to do, and so little time. “Should we win the day and repel this blight, I give you my solemn word that I will do all in my power to honor the pacts made between our ancestors. Allow us the opportunity to restore our honor in your eyes, and we will return the favor tenfold.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kenak nodded decisively. “I will take you at your word, goro! And I am certain the elders will do the same.” He then threw his head back and let out a mighty roar, causing Zelda to cover her ears and several onlookers to step back. “Hear me, Zelda, Queen of the Hylians, and know Kenak to be a mighty warrior!” He beat his chest. “If it pleases you, direct me to where I may be of most service!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wow. That was… unexpected. Zelda glanced towards Wymar and raised an eyebrow. Wymar shrugged. “I’m not about to turn down a capable fighter, Kenak,” he said. He stepped forward and shook the Goron’s hand. “Lord General Wymar Letholdus,” he said. “I suppose we could best use you at the southeastern—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Your Grace!” yet another messenger interrupted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother, what now?! Zelda desperately needed to break away from this mess and meet with Izu about his mission. Everything else had to wait.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“News from Last Bastion,” the girl said. “Arlinkar and his team—they’re alive!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world spun. Zelda gasped and covered her mouth. “<i>Link?</i> He’s alive?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They’re awaiting orders, Your Grace,” the messenger girl continued. “Unfortunately they arrived too late to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shook her head and held up a hand, cutting the messenger off. “Now is not the time,” she said, turning to leave. “Wymar, we must meet with Izu. You: write up your report and have it delivered to me,” Zelda called over her shoulder. “I will get back to you with a response as soon as I can!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar barked orders to a lieutenant to see to Kenak before turning to follow. The messenger stood firm and saluted. “As you will, Your Grace!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda said a silent prayer in thanks to the Goddesses. Link was alive! This was good news.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…News she would have to process later.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Izu glanced over the faces of those present. The Queen, the Lord General, several Sheikah, and every other leader and military strategist on hand, offering their perspective and advice on how to proceed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>All waiting on him to make his decision.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The options were simple enough. When and where to strike?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Plan A. There were three secret exits Izu and a small team could take to leave Castletown and get in position behind enemy lines once the Blin settled. Assuming they stopped to rest overnight before attacking—which was a very reasonable assumption, though by no means assured—and further, <i>if</i> their intelligence could spot the Warlord in time…</span>
<br><br>
<span>That would allow for a surgical strike, and if they succeeded, it would result in the fewest casualties.</span>
<br><br>
<span>However, the plan was anything but assured. It had several points of failure, not the least of which was actually getting to the Warlord alive and in time to challenge him to Gugwayah before the attack. Despite the plan’s relative simplicity, Izu and his team might not get the chance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(It would also be nearly impossible for him and the others to escape after the fact, even if they succeeded. Everyone fully acknowledged Plan A as a suicide mission. But if his life was the cost of ensuring Hyrule’s victory, Izu would gladly pay that price.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>Plan B. Wait for the Blin to attack, and have Izu and a squadron in position to meet the Warlord wherever he be—whether on the field, at the gates, or back at camp. This would definitely be more reliable in terms of actually getting to the Warlord, but came at a terrible cost. Many thousands of Hylians would die in the defense, and Castletown itself would suffer unimaginable damage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What’s more, they had no idea how the remaining Blin forces would react, especially in the midst of battle. If they collapsed into anarchy as expected, the defenders would likely win and eventually route their foes. —But even then, the cost would be immense.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And if the Blin persisted in fighting? Well, there was always Plan Z: Retreat to the castle and burn the city to the ground. Unpleasant to consider, but it would work. The city had in fact been built with this tactic in mind, reserved for a situation exactly as dire as this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Plan C. The third and final option would be for Izu and a contingent to wait within the walls, but strike out against the Blin Warlord preemptively as soon as his location was spotted within the sieging horde; a sort of hybrid approach between the first two.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu had to admit this was more favorable in absolute terms than trusting him and a small team to work a miracle, but it still relied on intel finding the Warlord before the fighting began. Taking this option also meant they could fall back on Plan B if they could not find and engage the Warlord in time, and further, if they were to succeed, the Blin would still be outside the walls. Which meant it would be that much easier to rout them should they lose coordination than should the same happen in the midst of battle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Less people would have to die with Plan C than with Plan B, but essentially none of those sent out in the offensive contingent would be expected to return, regardless of the outcome of the actual duel. It would also leave considerably less forces available for carrying out fallback plans (such as burning the Blin alive within the city) should Izu fail.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lord General and his staff had signed off on all three plans, leaving the choice to Izu and Izu alone. Whichever he personally felt most likely to succeed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was his mission, after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, then?” Wymar asked, bringing Izu back to the moment. “What shall it be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu weighed his options carefully, knowing full well that the fate of the entire kingdom rested on his shoulders.</span>
<br><br>
