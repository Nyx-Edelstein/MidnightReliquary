<span>“Annoyed” didn’t quite get at it. Zelda was <i>incensed</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This woman had asked <i>them</i> to come to <i>her</i>—not the other way around! Zelda didn’t know what game the Lynx was playing at, but she had deferred the monumental responsibility she had to her people and her kingdom to be here—a decision that was seeming less and less sound by the moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Whatever her game was, Zelda was not about to be bullied by this woman. She felt she had been more than reasonable given the circumstances.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She managed to keep a hold on her temper, but only just.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know,” she said, letting a touch of scorn into her voice, “I’m certain if I knew more about you I would be able to cherry-pick your failings to throw back in your face too. Are you just going to ignore the fact that we managed to make Link into a Lightsworn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He is no Lightsworn,” the Lynx said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Cucco crap!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lynx turned to Link. “Are you a Lightsworn?” she asked simply.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err, I’m not sure,” he said, looking ill at ease. “I think so? I don’t know how I would know for certain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you not heard <i>any</i> stories about them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean I’m obviously not turning my enemies to stone at a glance or brimming with the holy light of the Mother Goddess, if that’s what you’re asking,” Link said. “I do have all the affinities now, though,” he added after a moment. “Even if I am still learning how to use most of the magics…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lynx raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do you <i>believe</i> you are a Lightsworn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He scuffed his foot on the ground and mumbled something under his breath. “No, I guess I don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>But…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lynx turned now to Fi. “Is Link a Lightsworn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have insufficient information to come to a definite conclusion,” Fi answered. “However, this hypothesis seems to be at odds with the data available to me at this time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>What?! That was not fair! She couldn’t use Fi against her! How was there not a protocol against that? The infuriatingly attractive woman turned back to Zelda with a look of silent admonition, as if to say “I told you so.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, come on!” Zelda said sharply. “The artifact did <i>something!</i> Right Fi?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Affirmative,” Fi replied. “I observed significant changes to Link’s spiritual essence as a result of the ritual.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right! So even if he’s not a full Lightsworn now, he has the potential to become one. That’s better than nothing, isn’t it?” Zelda realized too late that she had only set herself up for another failure in the Lynx’s eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Look, it doesn’t matter,” she hastily amended. “I freely admit that I am a shit ruler, and yes, I haven’t accomplished much to speak of. But I’ve at least managed to keep my kingdom from catching fire and collapsing to a pile of rubble in the face of it all, and you can go <i>shove it</i> if you think you could’ve done a better job! Niesis and the scepter was a <i>single mistake</i> among my many decisions—one that could have easily been avoided if I had any idea what I was doing. But you are right; I don’t. I’ve been stumbling through the dark, more or less, making it up as I go and doing my best despite my ineptitude. But that’s exactly why I’m here! You’re concerned with me making <i>more mistakes</i>? Then the best way to avoid that is to <i>help me</i>! I came here because we are desperate for answers, which you clearly have. Anything you can tell me can only—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Do you think this is a game, Zelda?!” the Lynx shouted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda snapped back. Seeing the woman go from poised to red-faced so quickly was unsettling.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You think I have the answers?” she continued. The Lynx drew closer, her voice a tense whisper-yell. “If I had <i>answers</i> I wouldn’t be hiding out here in the mountains with my thumb up my ass, combing the world for clues while hanging my hopes on a naive, insecure, drug-abusing <i>failure</i> of a queen and her traumatized, wannabe-martyr bodyguard with a savior complex!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Those words stung, like few others Zelda had ever heard. She looked uncertainly to Link, feeling a tight burning in her chest. He didn’t look to be taking it any better.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your kingdom is going to fall,” the Lynx went on, unrelenting. “Your world is going to <i>burn</i>. You are going to die, and everything you know and love is going to be <i>ground to dust</i>. This is not an ominous warning. Your story does not have a happy ending. This outcome is <i>overdetermined</i>. You could perhaps be forgiven for your ignorance if somehow the fact of this matter had escaped you—but no! Here you are trouncing about in the desert hoping to find <i>salvation</i> by way of the mysterious stranger who summoned you from halfway across the world!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Ohhh.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It all made sense now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lynx?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was just as scared and helpless as the rest of them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re wrong,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>What.</i>” the Lynx spat. Zelda turned to face him as well—she was thankful to have the attention off of her, and rather curious as to his perspective.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t believe—I <i>refuse</i> to believe that all of this is for nothing,” he said. “Everything that’s happened to me in the past couple months? It’s hard to explain, but I just have this feeling. The silvery egg and the Lightsworn ritual are the best examples of that. An ancient artifact, lying dormant for hundreds—possibly thousands of years, that we just so happened to stumble upon the very day after I received Hylia’s mark? What are the chances of that? Hylia had to have had a hand in it. Don’t you see? She <i>had</i> to have known. The Goddesses had to have known—somehow—that all of this would happen, and they set a plan in motion ages ago. You? Me? Zelda? We’re all a part of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lynx only gawked at him in disbelief. “Unbelievable,” she said, rubbing the bridge of her nose. “Link—” she started, stopping with a groan that sounded of exasperation and dismay. “If you jumped from this cliff right now, what do you think would happen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh…” Link followed her gesture to look out over the cliff a few paces away. “I mean, I wouldn’t be surprised if doing so awakened some new mystical power inside me,” he said. “But I’m also not about to jump and find out. If you had to make plans involving me, you wouldn’t bother to account for me randomly deciding to jump off a cliff, would you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Lynx regarded him, stone-faced and unamused. “So instead, let’s say you had to face down an army of voidspawn with Ganondorf at the helm. Tomorrow. Alone. Or not even! Let’s suppose you had the entirety of the Sheikah and a regiment of the most skilled veterans in your kingdom at your back? What then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, I’m not saying I believe I’m immortal,” he said uneasily. “Just—I don’t think it’s as bad as you make it out to be. Hylia has a hand in this still—that much is certain. No matter what happens, we have to have faith. We have to follow her guidance. I mean, we’ve been led to you, haven’t we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda noticed something just then; a crack in the Lynx’s armor. She looked as if she had something rather pointed to say to that, but then thought better of it. “Whatever,” she said dismissively. “Believe whatever you want to believe. It’s not my job to talk sense into you. If you find any more <i>blessings</i> from your dead goddess lying around, I’ll be the first to cheer for you. But I’m also not going to count on divine intervention saving our asses again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Excuse me, Lynx?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My name. You can call me Shesan.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s with ‘the Lynx,’ then?” Link asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan turned away, crossing her arms and throwing one hand out into the air. “Thus far I have gone to great pains to obscure my identity, so as not to draw attention to myself. However—as you have likely surmised—the situation is dire enough that I have risked tipping my hand regardless in order to have you here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But why would you do that?” Link asked, puzzled. “You seem to know everything about us already, and you don’t seem very impressed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s because I’m <i>not</i>,” she said bitterly. “But Hylia has chosen you lot, and that doesn’t leave me with many options, now does it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But I thought you said—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waved a hand. “We’re discussing divinities here. Where they are concerned, death is more complicated than you might think.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan?” Zelda tried again. “I know you’re struggling,” she said, opting for a different approach. “And I know you feel like you don’t have the answers. But you <i>do</i> know more than we do, and that <i>is</i> something. If we’re to have any hope of coming out of this—any hope at all—we need to know what we’re facing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan didn’t answer. Zelda felt something there, and so decided to press.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I note that you never answered me about how you know what you know,” she said. “And the way you talk about us? About Hylia? About the Goddesses? You aren’t from this world, are you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Shesan said quietly. “I’m not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked to Link.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then where are you from?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not important.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>What?</i> How could she possibly believe—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Later, perhaps. It was probably better not to press if she wasn’t forthcoming.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did it destroy your world?” Zelda asked cautiously. “Is that why you’re here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it’s… nothing so simple,” Shesan said. “It would be easier to show you.” She turned back to them, pacing towards Zelda with an arm outstretched, but stopped as Link interposed himself. Zelda placed a hand on his shoulder. He looked back to her, and she nodded. Reluctantly, he stepped aside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it you intend?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan did not speak; instead she stepped forward with both hands extended, motioning to the pair. Hesitantly Zelda and Link took her hands, then each other’s in turn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world washed away in light.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda found herself standing atop the world, looking out into the heavens. Her vision blurred as stars zoomed past and the world shrunk, until it appeared as a golden pearl floating before her; glowing, pulsing. Around her, a shining chromatic barrier separated the space inside from the shadows of the Void. The barrier was complete and all-encompassing, except…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Except for a <i>crack</i> off to one side. There, wisps of chromatic vapor streamed outward; slow and steady, like steam rising from a boiling kettle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Curious, Zelda neared and pressed her eye up against the fissure, peering out to the other side. What she saw was a space much like the one she occupied, with its own shimmering barrier and its own pearl. However, this one was not gold, but <i>black</i>. Black and red; charred and cracked, like the cooling surface of molten rock. Smoke billowed out in plumes around the charred pearl, and tendrils spread out to snake across the expanse toward her. The tendrils coalesced into the shape of a fist and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The fist <i>slammed</i> into the barrier with great force. Zelda threw herself backward as what felt like the foundation of the world shook and rumbled in response. The crack in the barrier gave way momentarily, allowing some of the smoke through before stitching itself back together. Zelda watched helplessly as the smoke formed again into tendrils and streamed past her, straight towards the pearl at her back. As they neared, the tendrils poured into the pearl, and its light dimmed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda went to inspect the pearl more closely, but a sudden motion caught her eye. She spun. It was then that she realized—the Void was <i>moving</i>. The shadows on the surface of the shimmering barrier around her seemed to be <i>alive.</i> Scales of shadow and flame twisted and turned, flowing over one another as a gigantic serpent slithered about.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lying in wait. Biding its time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The body of the serpent parted and gave way, revealing an intense flame that expanded to encompass the whole of her vision. The fire burned brightly; brighter and hotter than anything she imagined possible. Zelda tried to turn and cover her eyes, but it was no use. She could not hide from the beautiful, awesome, terrible flame. It was everywhere at once—she even felt it burning within her very being. From where she stood, protected as she was, it was dulled and diluted to almost nothing; an echo, far and distant. But it was there, nonetheless. Unmistakable. Pure, yet complex.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was the warmth of true love, and also the cold emptiness it left behind with distance and time. It was the passion of lovers in the throes of ecstasy, and also the twisting fear of inadequacy and rejection. It was the desire to reach for the forbidden, and also the humiliating shame of guilt and denial. It was the grief of those touched by death, and the bittersweet memories of those they lost. It was the urge to create marvelous wonders and to explore the unknown, and also fields of crumbling tombstones and the ruins of kingdoms long forgotten.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The light of the flame <i>shifted</i> in her mind, refracting into colors; red, orange, gold, and then black, where the flames met and joined with the scales of the serpent. A black so dark and deep it drank in the light around it—and yet it burned still: deep, angry, and violent. Zelda knew in an instant she was nothing next to this being. Were it not for the shimmering barrier that was the Goddesses’ protection, the tiniest mote of those black flames would consume her and her entire world as surely as the sun would rise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This thing…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>This</i> was Hylia’s Demise.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The great serpent coiled into a writhing mass, and for the first time Zelda understood the true nature of what she saw.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The writing mass was a face. A face consumed by the fire, eyes alight with its dark, wondrous radiance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And the face was laughing.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Zelda’s vision returned and she stumbled back, falling to the ground. As she gathered her bearings, she found Link at her side, helping her to her feet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Why</i>?” was all she could think to ask. “What does it want?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How did it defeat Hylia, then? How do we fight it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>I don’t know</i>,” Shesan repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Link said hotly. “There has to be something! You have to know something!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan eyed them, and Zelda could feel herself being weighed and measured under the scrutiny of her gaze.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is something it wants,” she said. “And it seems to be willing to throw away anything and everything to get it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And that is?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Triforce.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s hand went to his necklace; Zelda’s to her bracers and locket.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s hands began to tremble as her thoughts caught up to her. A torrent of emotions swirled within; a thousand streams threatening to bubble up all at once. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she suspected. In truth, she put the pieces together long ago. It wasn’t a leap. It wasn’t even a stretch. It was the only possible conclusion, given the facts.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>How many Gerudo tribes were camping out in the highlands?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Who had the leader of that tribe pledged herself to?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>And what had that woman done, knowing all she knew?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It was only out of desperation that Zelda had come here, hoping to find answers in a hopeless situation. In so doing, she had put the truth from her mind out of necessity, not trusting herself to act with a level head otherwise. But now, she could deny it no longer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Here stood the woman responsible for all of Vesyrn’s betrayals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Here stood the woman responsible for poisoning and killing Father.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Here stood the woman responsible for Impa’s death.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“For what it’s worth… I am sorry,” Shesan said. “I never intended for anyone to get hurt. As it turns out, conducting a covert operation in the middle of a siege is… difficult. And messy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda knew she had to continue the conversation, but did not trust herself to speak. She had to find out…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>—No.</i> A cold rage burned within her, refusing to be denied. She could not let this pass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Did it even occur to you to put a modicum as much effort into convincing Father to work with you, as you did into subverting his loyal servants and plotting his death?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I did not kill your Father, Zel—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>LIAR!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A tense silence settled between them. Shesan glanced pointedly to Fi.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Oh.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>What?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“I understand your anger—but that was not me,” Shesan said. “That was not <i>Vesyrn</i>. It was Ganondorf’s assassins who killed your father, Zelda. They attacked him the same time as they did you. Impa died defending him as Vesyrn fled.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked back to Fi.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She is sincere, Mistress,” Fi said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Next, I suppose you’re going to tell me you didn’t poison him either,” Zelda said coldly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. That I must confess to, sadly,” Shesan said with a frown. “But again—I never intended harm. The poison Vesyrn used had an antidote. We were planning—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Spare me the excuses, Shesan,” Zelda said through grit teeth. “I don’t want to hear them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The woman recoiled at that as if she had been slapped. “Fair enough,” she said with a wince.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda knew she had no choice but to work with this woman. Too much was at stake. She was too useful—too knowledgeable—despite her claims to the contrary. Still… despite herself, all Zelda could think about was a pretty corpse lying in a pool of blood.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The silence was deafening. Link—through sheer force of will—kept his nerves under control. He was terrified Zelda was about to make a <i>very</i> stupid mistake. Laylith was scrying from afar and she and the others were ready to move at a moment’s notice, but even then… they were badly outnumbered, and who even knew what Shesan was capable of?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I need to be alone right now,” Zelda said at last, sounding distant. “Please, continue on with Link. He will fill me in later.” She turned to him. “Link, is that okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked between her and Shesan. He nodded slowly, reluctantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span> “Thank you,” Zelda said. And with that, she departed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Leaving him alone with the frighteningly intelligent alien-lady who by all accounts likely knew what he had for dinner this time last month.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At least he could relax now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unfortunate,” Shesan said. She turned to him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—How was <i>he</i> supposed to handle this, exactly? Link’s mind refused to function.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan rolled her eyes. “Let’s get this over with quickly,” she said. “She will likely want to know the location of her father’s fragment. It is safe for now, and it is a safe bet that neither you nor she will be able to bond with it. If you have another promising candidate, we can try, although I assure you it is as safe as it can be, given the circumstances. Ganondorf currently possesses five of the nine fragments of Power, and no doubt is actively searching for the others as we speak. It is common knowledge—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Wait! Wait,” Link said, unable to keep up. “This is too much. I need to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Your construct will remember the details of this conversation with perfect clarity,” Shesan said. “Unless you have something important to add, <i>please</i>, do not interrupt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Right. “Okay,” Link said. “Sorry. Go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan continued without missing a beat. “As I was saying, it is common knowledge another shard lies with the Gorons. Thus far I have not managed to make contact, and Ganondorf is likely to turn his attention there soon. Unfortunately, we remain in the dark as to the location of the other two. Likewise with Courage; I haven’t the faintest clue. Not for lack of trying, mind you. As for—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Wait! <i>Sorry</i>, just a quick question,” Link said, cursing himself as the Lynx eyed daggers his way. He had an obligation to fulfill however, and he would see his duty upheld. “It’s probably stupid, but if Demise wants the fragments so badly—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Demise?</i>” She gave him a look that reminded Link very much of Lieutenant Averil’s withering gaze.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Err—I mean, we could just keep calling it ‘the enemy’ or ‘the power behind Ganondorf,’ but I thought that was too much of a mouthful. It fits, doesn’t it?“ It also sounded cool, but he wasn’t about to say that in front of Shesan. If he was destined to fight a cosmic evil, then by the Mother that evil had better have a worthy name.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan crossed her arms and then covered her face. “Fine. Demise. What was your question?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Question? Oh, right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why can’t we just hide the fragments?” he asked. “I mean I know they come back to you if they’re stolen—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—That is not even <i>remotely</i> how they work,” she said. “And yes, I have thought of that. Look—” she motioned to his neck, holding out her hand. “Hand it here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not going to—just <i>hand it to me</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Reluctantly, Link did so. Shesan wound her arm back and threw it from the cliff.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“HEY! Listen, you can’t just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>Shut. Up. And wait.</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link stood there, dumbfounded, kicking himself for how stupid he had to be to just hand over his fragment like that. That was not like him! Come to think of it, why was he still standing here waiting—</span>
<br><br>
<span>His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the lift being operated. A moment later, a tall, fair-skinned Gerudo woman approached them from the tunnel entrance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…And she was holding Link’s necklace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ꡨꡟꡌ ꡟꡟꡨꡲꡨꡡ ꡱꡟꡲꡦꡛꡟ꡵ ꡟꡀ ꡪꡲꡟ ꡲ ꡟꡛꡱꡲꡲ ꡇꡥꡲꡠꡨ ꡲ ꡡꡠꡟꡊ?” she said, striding over to pass the necklace to Shesan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ꡍꡫꡀꡲꡆꡫꡟꡟ ꡡꡠꡟꡊ. ꡡꡠꡟꡊ ꡀꡢꡀ ꡀꡪꡀꡨꡌ,” Shesan said. The woman bowed and left. Shesan passed the necklace back to Link, and he slipped it back onto his neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh. What just happened?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You are bonded to it,” she said simply. “A rather strong bond too, it seems. Only your death can sever that bond. Well—that or a stronger bond, but the latter seems unlikely. Hiding it away won’t work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… see,” Link said. <i>Huh.</i>. He would have to talk about this with Zelda for sure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any other questions?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link paused, thinking. “I don’t think so? Not at the moment,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then as I was saying: Wisdom. Nineve’s fragment has not yet been recovered, though Golvara has kept it out of enemy hands for the time being. Vesyrn is—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait! Golvara—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Yes, Golvara is one of my agents,” Shesan said, not even letting him finish the question. She went on, not allowing him to get another word in. “—And Vesyrn is tracking down a lead in the Old Kingdom, beyond the Plains of Ruin. Apparently another Sheikah is giving him some trouble—I was hoping Zelda could help with that. If she could call them off, they could work to mutual benefit.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded. “I’ll be sure to let her know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link looked to her expectantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unfortunately, that’s all,” she said. “The location of the others still eludes me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are we done?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… hmm,” Link said, pondering. “Yeah, I think that’s—no wait. One more question. Sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan motioned for him to proceed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I asked Naibi about one of the locations I saw in the vision I had after the Lightsworn ritual—” he paused. “You know about that too, don’t you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know everything there is to know about you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Right.</i>” Link shuddered. Mother’s Mercy, this woman… “Anyway. I don’t know why, but she lied to me when I asked. She said she didn’t know where it was, but I’m pretty sure she does. I was hoping you might know something about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan sighed in irritation. “Listen: they don’t like talking about this, and for good reason,” she said. “But the Obsidian Spire? That was the binding location of a Void entity named <i>Morudo Geira</i>. It’s about a weeks’ ride south of here if you follow the mountains. Ganondorf went there and slew her avatar years ago. It’s the reason he was made their king. Depending on who you ask, you’ll hear that it’s haunted, cursed, or a wellspring of evil: in short, no one is very eager to go there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” Link said, feeling oddly disappointed that someone had already beaten him to it. “Wait, does that mean Ganon—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—<i>No,</i> he is not a <i>Lightsworn,</i>” Shesan answered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link was getting rather tired of this woman, but another question pried at his mind. He wasn’t sure if he should ask, but…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had to know.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why don’t they talk about it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, for the love of— because for hundreds of years their culture centered around essentially making blood sacrifices of all their male children through bloodsport, trials, and tournaments to the death in order to appease Geira. <i>Happy?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was… wow.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Wow,” was all Link could think to say.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yeah.</i> Anything else?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shook his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good. <i>Now leave</i>.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link immediately turned and left without another word. He had so much on his mind, and they had a lot to discuss.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hopefully Zelda was holding up well.</span>
