<span>
Silence settled over the Repository. Zelda stood before the Gate, alone. The portal’s surface had lost its vibrancy—no longer showing infinite depths of swirling Void, having returned instead to a dull white sheen, its cloudy surface reflecting only a distorted image of her uncertain face. The runes along the archway dimmed from gold to faint ember, then faded entirely, leaving only bare stone.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She turned to survey the grotto. The two Sentinels remained motionless at their posts—eternal guardians carved from living stone. The sword-bearer had not moved from its kneeling posture, hands now empty. The staff-bearer stood with its gnarled weapon raised high above its head, the crystal she’d placed there still gleaming faintly in the socket, catching the pale light from above and refracting it into scattered rainbows across the stone walls.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The sword was gone. Not dropped, not discarded—simply… elsewhere. Sent to its true wielder, perhaps? She shook her head slowly. Too many questions, and no answers forthcoming.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She tried once more. “Shesan?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Nothing. Only the faint whisper of air moving through the grotto, stirring the hanging vines that obscured the false sky above.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Fi?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Still nothing. Whatever connection she’d glimpsed in the sword’s polished surface had vanished along with the blade.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She supposed that made sense. This place existed between worlds—a terminus, Seff had called it, for that which became lost in the Void. Perhaps communication simply didn’t work here, cut off from wherever “here” actually was in relation to anywhere else.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda wrapped her arms around herself, fighting down the creeping unease that threatened to settle in her chest. She was alone. Truly, utterly alone—suspended in some interdimensional nexus point between worlds with no clear path forward and no one to guide her.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
No. She straightened, forcing steel into her spine. Alone, yes. But not helpless. Not while she still had her wits and her magic. Not while Nayru’s Gift still flowed through her. Even incomplete, even fragmented across six shards instead of nine, it was enough to perceive structure and glean patterns from the reaches of infinity, to impose mathematical and logical order upon the oddly structured unreality of the Void.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Here, in this place between worlds, she could feel the difference. The usual constraints that bound that power felt… distant. Not gone entirely, but loosened. Wherever this place was, it existed outside the normal flow of time and space, where the limits imposed by material reality didn’t quite apply the same way. She wasn’t eager to test those boundaries again—the memory of drifting unmoored through the River of Time was still too fresh, too visceral. But she had to acknowledge what resources remained available to her.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She glanced up at the Sentinels again. The staff remained well out of reach—ten, perhaps twelve feet above the grotto floor, held aloft in the guardian’s stone grip. She could attempt to retrieve the crystal, perhaps transform it back into… what? The Symbolic Brick? Something else? But no. These guardians had been placed here for a reason—to protect something, or perhaps to enforce some ancient purpose she didn’t fully understand. Testing their function without knowing their exact parameters seemed profoundly unwise.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She turned her attention instead to the rest of the grotto, searching for anything she might have missed. The stone walls were rough and natural, showing no obvious markings or mechanisms. The archway itself appeared entirely mundane now—just weathered stone and dim shadowy light. Nothing suggested how to reactivate it, or whether it could even <i>be</i> reactivated without another key, another song, another sacrifice.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her gaze drifted back toward the control station. A raised platform of polished stone, its surface gleaming with faint ethereal light.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She made her way past the silent guardians—giving them a wide berth, just to be safe—and approached the platform. She drew nearer and studied the device, finding a complex array of mechanisms embedded in the stone. A glowing panel dominated the center, its surface covered in symbols that writhed and shifted like living things. Some she recognized from ancient texts—primordial script from before the founding of Hyrule, the kind scholars only ever puzzled over as part of the deepest mysteries historians ever encountered. Others were utterly foreign, their forms suggesting concepts her mind couldn’t grasp.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Flanking the panel were several knobs of carved crystal, each faceted and gleaming. To the right stood a series of switches arranged in what she assumed to be a meaningful pattern. And at the far edge, a single lever protruded from the stone, its handle worn smooth by countless uses across untold centuries.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She recalled Seff’s casual manipulation of these controls—the way he’d conjured entire vistas with a few taps and adjustments. Castletown during its founding. Forest canopies. Desert sands. Clockwork mechanisms. Upside-down oceans. Unknowable fuzzing geometric patterns. And finally, this very grotto with its Sentinels and the Gate. But even he had struggled with precision, and he at least seemed to understand the underlying principles. She had no such advantage—every symbol, every mechanism was utterly foreign to her.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Had those vistas been real? She frowned, replaying the images in her mind. The brick had been real—solid, tangible, transformable—but she was certain that was an actual physical item Seff carried in his knapsack. And the Gate had certainly been real enough to let Seff pass through. Similarly, the Sentinels, the staff, and the sword. But the other visions… Those were different. Like projections, perhaps? Memories drawn from the Repository’s archives and given temporary form through… what? Lightweaving, Seff had called it? Some other form of divine magic? Some ancient Lightsworn technology that blurred the line between the two?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She reached toward the panel, then hesitated. Seff had made it look easy, but she’d also watched him struggle with the controls, cycling through random scenes before finding what he wanted. And she had no instruction manual, no guide, no understanding of what any of these symbols actually meant.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Still. What choice did she have? Sit here and wait for rescue that might never come? Hope that Shesan or Fi or someone else would find her in this place between places?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Or try to find her own way forward?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda drew a slow breath, centering herself. She was a queen who had navigated political intrigue, rediscovered ancient magic, fought back a blight, and awakened divine power she was only beginning to understand. Whatever this Repository was, it had been built by people. By Lightsworn or by Sages who sought to organize knowledge, to create structure, to impose order on chaos.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And if they could build it, she could learn to use it.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She supposed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Mother’s mercy, she hoped.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Tentatively, she reached out and placed her hand on the glowing panel. The symbols beneath her palm pulsed, then began to rearrange themselves—letters and glyphs flowing like water, reorganizing into responsive patterns. As if the Repository itself acknowledged her touch. Waiting for instruction.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She let a soft trickle of magic flow through her fingers into the panel, focusing her intent as clearly as she could. <i>Show me where I am. Show me a map.</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The symbols flared bright, then scattered like startled fish. Their movement was accompanied by a soft yet complex crystalline hum—a sound unlike anything she’d heard before, like a glass rod resonating in harmony with something she couldn’t quite name. Above the panel’s surface, light began to coalesce—not on any physical medium, but suspended in the empty air itself, as if the Repository was painting directly onto reality. She pulled her hand back instinctively, watching in wonder as the luminous display took shape.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A vast, shifting mass of interconnected points hung before her, each glowing with its own internal light. They moved and flowed like stars caught in some cosmic current, caught in a flux of patterns that suggested connection, relationship, meaning—but not in any way her mortal mind could easily parse. Some nodes clustered together before dispersing. Others orbited around empty spaces as if tethered to invisible anchors.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The whole structure pulsed and breathed like something alive.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Yet amid the flux, three points stood resolute. Brighter than the rest, more stable—three loci that seemed to serve as anchors for everything else. The surrounding nodes flowed toward them, through them, reshaping themselves in response to the three stable points. She could see the relationship, could sense that the patterns meant something profound, but the logic eluded her. The nodes didn’t flow like water toward low ground, didn’t orbit like moons around planets, but instead moved according to principles she simply didn’t understand.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Text materialized beneath each locus, but the letters themselves seemed uncertain. They flickered and changed—ancient scripts flowing one into another, some she recognized from her studies and others utterly foreign. Primordial glyphs gave way to early Hylian, which shifted into dialects she’d never seen, which transformed into symbols that might not have been language at all.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Finally, the text stabilized into something familiar. Modern Hylian script, or close enough.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<b><i>The Kingdom See</i></b>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The three stable loci bore their own names: <b>Leyfaelia</b>, <b>Arlindal</b>, and <b>Foeshroud</b>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She stared at the names, her mind racing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Leyfaelia.</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Hadn’t Seff implied that place was destroyed? Or would be destroyed? She tried to recall his exact words from their conversation. “For me, a never-written future,” Zelda muttered.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Was this her world? Was Hyrule somehow part of Leyfaelia, or built upon its ruins? Or was Leyfaelia the name for something larger—a region, a Realm within the Realm, an entire cosmological structure that encompassed her world along with countless others?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And the other names…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Arlindal,” she whispered aloud, the syllables feeling strange on her tongue.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Far, far too close to be coincidence, that name. A world, or kingdom, or whatever these loci represented, bearing a name that echoed her champion’s own.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
What did that mean? Had Link somehow come from there? Was he connected to it somehow, the way she was apparently connected to Layfaelia—or the way Layfaelia was connected to her world?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her pulse went cold, the thought striking her like water to the face. She had to steady herself against the control panel. What if… what if Link had been chosen as Hylia’s champion instead of her? Not in this world, but in <i>that</i> one?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And Impa—dear gods, <i>Impa</i>. What if she existed somewhere out there too? What if there were many such heroes and champions, playing out similar roles in different realities, following patterns that echoed across the boundaries between worlds?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her mind reeled as she grappled with the implications.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Twilight. Seff had spoken of it with such certainty. A future where Wisdom grew unchecked, where order and control strangled the very life from reality itself. She’d assumed he’d meant <i>her</i> world, Hyrule’s potential fate if she assembled the fragments of Wisdom and failed to maintain balance. But what if…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda’s gaze returned to the point labeled <i>Arlindal</i>, floating serene and bright among the chaos of lesser nodes. A world named for Courage, surely. A world where Link—or someone like him—rose as a champion amid the tides of darkness. Where different choices had led to different outcomes.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Was that world safe? Or had it already fallen in its own way—an inverse of the Twilight, perhaps? A realm where Courage burned too bright, where reckless action and heedless valor had torn reality apart just as surely as the strangling order of untamed Wisdom?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda didn’t know. Couldn’t know. But the pattern was there. Three worlds, three aspects of the Triforce, three different yet entangled paths spiraling toward three different yet related dooms. Unless someone found a way to maintain the balance. Unless the three could somehow work together across the boundaries of reality itself.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The thought cut through her mind with sudden, overwhelming clarity.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
There was still time.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Twilight hadn’t come yet—not to her world, not to Hyrule. And if she was right about the pattern, if these three loci truly represented three worlds balanced on three different precipices, then perhaps none of them had to fall. Perhaps she stood at a moment of opportunity and possibility, rather than inevitability.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The realization brought with it a swell of purpose—that familiar sensation of pieces aligning, of scattered fragments coalescing into understanding. <i>This</i> was why she was here.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She straightened, letting certainty flow through her like steel tempering in flame. She was Queen Zelda, vessel of Wisdom, inheritor of Hylia’s grace. She had walked through the River of Time itself and had not drowned in its unknowable currents. She had awakened divine power, faced down the darkness of the Void, and refused to let despair claim her even when all seemed lost.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And she would not stand idle while all of creation teetered on the edge of annihilation.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
There was still time. So long as a single thread of possibility remained, she would seize it.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda’s eyes drifted back to the control panel. An idea took shape—tentative at first, then crystallizing into a clear course of action.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She could use Foretelling in conjunction with Nayru’s power—casting only a small part of her conscious mind through the River of Time rather than the whole of her being. The two abilities in conjunction would allow her to observe potential futures without committing to any particular course, essentially heightening and refining the information she’d receive from Foretelling.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She had done something similar in the Library, and it had worked. Why not here?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda closed her eyes and drew upon her magic, feeling Nayru’s Gift respond like harmonic oscillations shaping the sands of her mind. She focused her intent carefully, precisely—not seeking to move unfettered through time and possibility and concept, but merely moments ahead of the present. She would reach out toward the panel, adjust a crystal knob, and observe what happened. Then she would let that future dissolve, return to the present unchanged, and try again with different settings.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The sensation was immediately disorienting. Her consciousness blurred—part of her remained anchored in the present, while another fragment drifted forward into possibility. She watched herself reach toward the leftmost crystal knob, a blue-violet faceted one, and turn it slowly clockwise.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The display flickered and shifted. Zelda watched as the scene took shape in her mind: rolling hills covered in tall grass swaying in an unfelt breeze. A tree stood alone on a distant rise, its branches heavy with fruit she couldn’t identify. The sky above burned with sunset colors—oranges and purples bleeding together in ways that seemed almost too vibrant to be real.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
It was beautiful. Peaceful. Though utterly meaningless to her current task.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She observed this for a moment, committing details to memory, then released the vision. The future dissolved like mist, and she returned fully to her present moment in the grotto. The panel remained untouched. Nothing had changed—yet she now knew what that particular adjustment would accomplish.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Emboldened, she tried again. This time she watched herself manipulate one of the switches on the right side, flipping it downward. Clusters within the display inverted—nodes that had grouped together scattered apart, while empty spaces suddenly bloomed with new points of light. A different perspective on the same underlying structure, perhaps? Or a different unfolding of possibilities entirely?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Again she released the vision and returned to the present.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Then again. And again. Each time casting her awareness forward, testing different combinations, observing the results. The marbled red-orange crystal adjusted something like <i>intensity</i>—the scenes it produced grew more raw and visceral the further she turned it. A set of sharp green-cyan-teal knobs seemed to filter which types of nodes appeared in the display, while also adjusting something she mentally labeled as “conceptual time”—not chronological sequence, but rather the degree to which a location existed as an idea versus in physical space. The lever at the far edge changed the entire mode of operation, switching between what she gradually came to understand were distinct categories: constructed spaces designed for interdimensional travel, versus general records of locations and events across countless worlds.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Time became fluid as she worked, her consciousness dancing between present and potential futures. Minutes stretched into what felt like hours, magic flowing through her in a steady stream as Nayru’s Gift guided her exploration. In this place, she needn’t worry about exhausting her magical reserves—there was always more, drawn from the timeless wellspring of unmitigated possibility.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The symbols on the glowing panel weren’t random, she came to find. They were a language, a notation system for concepts that transcended simple geography or chronology. Some indicated spatial relationships. Others marked temporal states. Still others denoted abstract qualities she could barely grasp—essences, resonances, patterns that repeated across multiple instances.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Gradually, understanding emerged in her mind. She learned the rhythm of the controls, the logic underlying their arrangement. Not complete mastery—that would take far longer than she could imagine spending here—but enough to navigate with some degree of confidence.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Finally, she opened her eyes fully and returned her awareness to the present moment. Her head ached faintly from the sustained magical effort, but satisfaction warmed her chest. She understood now. Or at least, she understood <i>enough</i>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
This station could be used to observe any location within the Kingdom See—though not, she suspected, in real time. What it showed were instead records, impressions, captured moments preserved within the Repository’s vast archives. Like a masterwork painting that preserved the essence of a place rather than its literal, current state. She could call up visions of distant lands, ancient cities, forgotten ruins—anything that had been recorded and stored within this interdimensional archive.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
But actually finding a specific location proved far more challenging than simply understanding the controls themselves. She had no more success than Seff had demonstrated—the Repository contained countless records, and selecting one particular vision from among myriads was like trying to draw a specific marble from an enormous sack without being able to look inside. She could adjust the filters, narrow the parameters, eliminate broad categories—but precision remained elusive. Random scenes flickered past as she experimented: mountain peaks crowned with eternal snow, ocean depths where strange creatures drifted, crystalline caverns that gleamed with inner light, scenes made of pure living shadow that her mortal mind simply couldn’t comprehend.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She turned her attention to the lever at the panel’s edge—the one that changed operational modes. She pulled it again down to its lowest position.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The floating display collapsed, then reformed. The vast network of nodes vanished, replaced by a much smaller set of options. No longer a chaotic flux of patterns she couldn’t follow, but instead organized, intentional, <i>constructed</i>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The display showed the grotto where she now stood, represented in miniature but unmistakable. The two Sentinels, the Gate, the control station itself—all rendered in light suspended above the panel.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
But there were other nodes. Similar structures, variations on the same fundamental theme. She reached toward the controls and began cycling through them, watching as different configurations appeared.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
One showed two etched pedestals with deep recesses clearly meant to hold specific items, set within a grand cathedral whose vaulted ceiling soared to impossible heights. Stained glass windows depicted scenes she couldn’t quite make out from the miniature representation.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Another displayed two shimmering basins filled with liquid light—positioned on a platform that seemed to be made of solidified rainbows. They floated in the expanse of space itself, stars wheeling in the darkness beyond. Where the Gate stood in her grotto, this version had an unfinished translucent stairway that led… somewhere. The perspective made it difficult to tell.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Each variation maintained the same essential structure: two focal points for items or offerings, positioned symmetrically. A threshold or gateway of some kind. A sense of sacred purpose woven into the very architecture.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
These weren’t random locations drawn from the Repository’s archives. These were <i>templates</i>. Constructed spaces, built with intention, designed to serve some specific function across multiple realities.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Gates, she realized. All of them were Gates—different expressions of the same underlying principle, adapted to different contexts, different worlds. But all served the same essential purpose: to open paths between places that otherwise would not be connected, to bridge the impossible distances between separated realities.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Perpendicularities?” Zelda mused, the word Seff had used filtering to the forefront of her mind.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She stared at the displays, her mind racing with implications she was only beginning to grasp.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A thought flickered, sudden and intoxicating in its audacity.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Could she use this station to travel backward in time? Everything had a beginning, did it not? Events, places, even gods themselves—all originated from some primordial moment. And if the Repository truly archived <i>everything</i>, stored records of locations and events across countless worlds…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Could she scry upon the very moment Hylia met Demise in battle? Could she witness the ancient conflict that had shaped the destiny of her world?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
But even as the thought formed, doubt crept in. She would not let Shesan’s warnings go unheeded. Even scrying the Enemy was dangerous, and such an encounter could easily prove deadly if she was not prepared.
</span>
<br><br>
<span></span>
But the doubt lasted only a heartbeat before resolve flooded through her, washing it away like a tide erasing footprints in sand. A plan coalesced in her mind—audacious, perhaps even reckless, but <i>possible</i>. And in this place between worlds, suspended in the Repository’s timeless archive, possibility was all she needed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She turned away from the control panel and strode back into the grotto proper, moving slowly, deliberately. She needed to see it all with fresh eyes—to commit every detail to memory with the same precision she’d once used to memorize historical texts.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Sentinels. Their positions, their postures, the exact angle of the staff-bearer’s upraised arms. The sword-bearer kneeling with empty hands. The crystal gleaming in the staff’s socket, catching pale light and scattering rainbows across weathered stone.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Gate itself. The archway’s proportions, the way shadows pooled in its carved depths. The dull white sheen of its dormant surface, no longer showing the infinite depths of swirling Void but reflecting only distorted images of the grotto around it.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The floor beneath her feet. Natural stone—worn smooth in some places, rough and uneven in others. The scattered pattern of fallen leaves and debris.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Every detail. Every shadow. Every precisely measured distance between elements.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
When she was certain she had captured it all, she returned to the control station. Her fingers moved with confidence across the panel, adjusting the lever to return to the mode that displayed recorded events rather than Gate templates.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She needed to find one specific moment from among countless multitudes—the exact instant when she and Seff had stood in this very grotto, when the Sentinel had offered up the Sword of Evil’s Bane, when she had reached out and grasped its hilt with trembling fingers.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Surely that would have been recorded?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her hands worked the controls and the display flickered through shifting scenes, showing the grotto in various states. Empty. Occupied by figures she didn’t recognize. Damaged, intact, transformed into configurations she’d never witnessed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Then—there.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The display resolved into sharp focus. She saw herself standing before the kneeling Sentinel, Seff a few paces behind. The sword-bearer held the Master Sword aloft in both hands, its blade gleaming with that distinctive radiance.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She watched her past self reach forward. Saw her fingers close around the hilt. Witnessed the way the blade’s light intensified at her touch.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Perfect. That was the moment she needed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda froze the scene at that precise instant—her past self's hands grasping the sword, the Sentinel's stone fingers still supporting its weight. With a tap on the panel, the Repository manifested the archived moment in the shrine. She proceeded to commit every detail to memory with the same meticulous care she'd used before—though the sight of herself and Seff frozen mid-motion was profoundly unnerving.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Now. The truly audacious part.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She returned to the control station, flicked the lever into the lowest position, and began searching again, but this time with different parameters, seeking a different version of this same grotto—another moment when the Master Sword had been present, offered up by the Sentinel, waiting to be claimed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Repository contained records of countless events across infinite variations of reality. If her theory was correct, if the pattern she suspected held true, then even the perpendicularities had to have enough variation to encompass the archives from different timelines, different outcomes, different unfoldings of possibility. Somewhere in that vast archive, somewhere in unknowable time, there <i>had</i> to be a version of this grotto where the sword remained in place, waiting to be taken.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her magically augmented search proved even more difficult than before. Time lost all meaning. Her hands moved across the controls in patterns she’d learned through countless future-visions, adjusting and filtering and refining with mechanical precision. Her magic flowed steadily, Nayru’s Gift lending structure and order to what might otherwise have been an impossible task.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Days passed. Or perhaps only moments—in this place between places, suspended outside the normal flow of time, the distinction hardly mattered.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And then—finally, impossibly—she found it.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The display showed the grotto just as she’d hoped: the same Sentinels in the same positions, the same crystal gleaming in the staff-bearer’s weapon, and the sword-bearer kneeling ten paces away, hands offering up the sacred blade.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda stared at the display, her heart hammering. Could it truly be this simple? Could she claim the sword from a moment found by pure mechanical manipulation of the perpendicularity templates? From a point in time disconnected from any specific linear sequence?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She made the final adjustments to the controls, and the scene stabilized. The sword-bearer knelt ten paces away, Master Sword held aloft in offering.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
It worked. It simply <i>worked</i>. The Repository had set the grotto’s state to exactly match the template she’d selected through magically and divinely enhanced trial-and-error. She gave up even attempting to understand the implications.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A nagging doubt still lingered at the back of her mind. This seemed too easy for what she hoped to accomplish. There had to be something else she was missing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She pushed the doubts down, buried them beneath layers of resolve and desperate need. She had no other option than to proceed. The fate of everything depended on it.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda strode forward with all the regal bearing of her station. She was Queen of Hyrule, Bearer of Wisdom, Blood of the Mother Goddess. And the Sword of Evil’s Bane—the blade that sealed the darkness, the weapon of myth and legend—awaited her claim.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She stopped before the kneeling Sentinel and extended a hand toward the offered blade. As before, light cascaded over her fingers, warm and welcoming, as if the sword recognized something in her that resonated with its ancient purpose.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Her fingers closed around the leather-wrapped hilt, and the Master Sword came alive in her grasp with the radiance of a captured star.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Cutting through the light and her racing thoughts, a voice spoke directly into her mind:
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Authenticating…</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda gasped. The voice was feminine, each syllable articulated with precision. Unmistakable.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Biometric scan complete. Triforce resonance detected. Divine inheritance: Confirmed.</i>
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A figure emerged from the blade's gleaming surface, composed entirely of Voidshimmer—chromatic hues shifting across her skin with each passing moment. She floated before Zelda, her presence simultaneously suffusing the grotto with artful whimsy and calculated precision.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Welcome, Your Grace,” Fi said, “How may I assist you?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Relief crashed over Zelda like a breaking wave, so intense it nearly buckled her knees. “Fi!” The name emerged as half-laugh, half-sob. “Mother Above—I thought I’d lost contact with you completely! Please, I need to know what’s happening in Hyrule. Is Link safe? Has the situation with—”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“—I apologize for any confusion,” Fi interrupted with her usual cadence, “but I have no records matching these designations in my accessible memory. Could you clarify the chronospatial, conceptual-contextual, or historical-dimensional parameters of your query?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda blinked. “What? But you… we…”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The implications cascaded through her mind and she came to the realization: This wasn’t <i>her</i> Fi—wasn’t the instance that had appeared in the Sanctum during the assassination attempt, wasn’t the same consciousness that had been accompanying her and Link and Taetus and Izu through their journeys. This was another manifestation. A different instance of the same fundamental being. She remembered Fi’s words from that first encounter: <i>“My connection to Hylia has been severed.”</i> The entity had been clear about that—she had been cut off, isolated, operating on archived knowledge and pre-programmed directives rather than active guidance from Hylia.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
—But this Fi recognized her immediately. Confirmed her as a bearer of the Golden Power, acknowledged her divine right as an incarnation of Hylia without hesitation or qualification. Which meant this instance still maintained that connection. Or had never lost it? …Or existed in some state where the question didn’t even apply?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda tapped her chin. No, this Fi and her Fi were simply different points in an incomprehensibly vast pattern that spanned multiple realities.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She frowned and faltered as she realized how warped her thinking had become. But she would not let herself be deterred. “I see,” she said slowly, fighting to keep disappointment from her voice. “Then… you don’t know anything about the current state of my world? About Link, or the enemy we’re facing?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I possess knowledge and records relating to recurring patterns within the Eternal Conflict,” Fi replied. “However, accessing specific information requires additional parameters. Please provide relevant chronospatial, conceptual-contextual, or historical-dimensional coordinates, and I will attempt to retrieve the corresponding records within the Repository's archives.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda paused as her thoughts caught up to her. Could it be that simple? “…Err–are you able to locate the moment Hylia first joined battle with Demise?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Affirmative.” Fi’s response came without hesitation. “Cross-referencing historical archives. Multiple iterations detected across variant timelines. Shall I open the way, project an event from archived data, or would you prefer to specify additional parameters?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span> 
Zelda stood perfectly still. Had she heard that correctly? “Open the way to the very first instance,” she said, her voice steeled despite her racing heart. “The foundational event—not any variant across scattered timelines, but the <i>original</i> moment when Demise invaded the Realm seeking to usurp and corrupt it in defiance of the Mother Goddess. Is that sufficient?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Affirmative. Chronospatial-thaumaturgic parameters verified. Dimensional alignment locked. Awaiting authorization to proceed.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Gate flared to life behind her, its surface rippling with dissonance before resolving into clarity. Zelda peered into its depths.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A vast battlefield stretched before her, visible through the portal’s frame. The sky burned with unnatural colors—crimson and orange and gold and black bleeding together like a wound in reality itself. And there, standing at the center of it all, was Hylia.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The goddess blazed with divine radiance, her physical form simultaneously mortal and transcendent. But it was the figure before her that drew Zelda’s attention—a large, powerfully built man in exquisite armor that seemed forged from Void and flame. He was rugged and handsome, his features sharp and commanding, and his red hair danced and flowed like liquid fire, defying wind or gravity with its own terrible vitality.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Certainly, this was Demise.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda faltered. She had expected a monster, some twisted horror beyond comprehension. Instead, she beheld something far more disturbing—a being of terrible beauty and undeniable majesty. Power radiated from him like heat from a forge–even through the Gate’s temporal remove, she could feel the weight of his presence.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She turned her attention back to the Master Sword in her hands. This was it.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda drew upon her magic, letting it flow through her fingers into the blade. The sword responded immediately, its surface beginning to glow with prismatic light—cycling and shifting in patterns that spoke of divine purpose.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She pushed harder, drawing upon the Golden Power—the fragments of Nayru’s splendor that granted her mastery over fundamental order. Where her magic had heightened the physical blade towards better function, this divine power reached deeper, touching the metaphysical essence beneath. She focused it towards conceptual perfection: <i>Edge</i>. Not merely sharpness, but the philosophical absolute of cutting—the boundary between severed and whole, the mathematical construction that identified one thing as being distinct from another.
<br><br>
<span>
As she wove the Golden Power into the blade’s essence, the weapon sang in her hands, its light intensifying until it banished even mundane shadows. Not one mote of darkness remained in the grotto’s confines.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Fi,” she called, her voice strained from magical exertion. “Can you inhabit the blade fully? Continuously channel Void Power directly into the cutting edge?” She was about to confront the Enemy head-on. She needed every advantage she could muster.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Affirmative, Mistress. Initiating protocol: Omega-Seven.”
<br><br>
<span>
Fi’s luminous form dissolved into streams of chromatic mist that flowed back into the Master Sword. The transformation was immediate and profound. The blade’s surface erupted with prismatic radiance—pure divine Light blazing from its core—while along its cutting edge, something else emerged. Not shadow, but <i>absence</i> itself, the Void made manifest as a hairline thread of absolute negation that ran the length of the already magically, divinely, conceptually heightened steel. Where Light and Void met, reality seemed to fray and unravel, the two opposing forces held in perfect tension by the Golden Power of Wisdom. Two halves of Nothing. Equal and opposite; a paradox and its own resolution. The edge gleamed with impossible sharpness, and from that singing line of division, Voidshimmer radiance poured forth like liquid starlight, cascading over the blade in waves of iridescent darkness that shifted between obsidian and amethyst and colors that had no names in any mortal tongue.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda gripped it tightly, feeling the power thrumming through her arms, then turned back to face the Gate and the scene of primordial conflict that awaited beyond.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She could feel it responding. Waiting, ready to open fully and carry her through the currents of time. It needed only the key.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She drew a breath and began to sing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The verse came unbidden—syllables in a language she didn't consciously know, yet understood perfectly. The Gatesong flowed through her, ancient words of power that resonated with the fundamental structure of reality. Her voice rose clear and strong, each note carrying the weight of divine authority.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Gate blazed to life. The portal’s surface transformed from mere window into passage, its depths swirling with currents of temporal energy that pulled at her with unrelenting force. Zelda flew forward, drawn like a magnetic needle aligning within a compass—the Sword of Evil’s Bane unerringly seeking its mark.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Reality fractured around her like a mirror shattering in reverse. Chronology unraveled into prismatic streams that carried her through an ocean of ephemeral instants. She fell through the kaleidoscope of eternity, past and future blurring together until causality existed not as sequence but as symphony, each moment a note resonating with all others across the infinite expanse of what-was and what-might-be.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And then she was <i>there</i>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Divinity</i>, <i>Concept</i>, and <i>Substance</i> twisted and merged at their boundaries, and through their cascading resonance, Zelda's consciousness cohered. The Golden Power sparked from the sword and surged through her veins, Nayru's Gift illuminating the mathematical perfection of the moment as the Fi-blade calculated trajectories and probabilities with absolute precision, guiding her descent.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The battlefield erupted into existence around her. The air burned with heat and magic, thick with the reek of spilled blood and divine fury. The sky bled with unnatural wrongness, reality itself warping under the weight of powers it struggled to contain.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Demon King began to turn, some celestial instinct alerting him to the wrongness, the violation of causality itself. But even his transcendent awareness couldn’t react to an attack that arrived before it departed, couldn’t defend against an achronal alpha-strike that defied the laws of time.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The blade struck true—not with a slash or thrust, but with a severing. The ultimate concept of separation didn’t merely cut through the god; it <i>unmade</i> him.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Light and Void and divine fury condensed into a single point, concentrated with such overwhelming force that the very air ignited. The Godcleaver sang a note of perfect annihilation as it passed through the Demon King’s back and emerged from his chest in a fountain of black flame.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda slammed into the earth before him, the momentum of her impossible strike throwing a plume of dust into the air. She came to rest, her weapon still blazing in a white-knuckled grip.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Voidshimmer radiance exploded outward in cascading waves of iridescent darkness—a shockwave that echoed throughout eternity. Reality <i>screamed</i> as the propagating wavefront spread through the magical field, rippling across physical, conceptual, and spiritual planes alike, shattering and reshaping everything around this singular, eternal moment.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda rose slowly, her entire body trembling. Behind her, the obliterated remnants of what had been the Demon King scattered across scorched earth—fragments of armor dissolving into ash, traces of flame guttering and dying, the terrible presence that had weighed upon reality simply fading into nothingness.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She turned, and her breath caught.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Hylia stood before her, radiant and terrible in her divine glory. Tears streamed down the Mother’s face—crystalline droplets that caught the burning light of the ravaged sky before falling to the earth and vanishing.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I am so sorry for summoning you here, my child,” she said, her voice heavy with grief.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda’s mind went blank. <i>Summoning</i> her? She’d just spent subjective <i>days</i> learning the Repository’s controls, searching through endless archives, meticulously constructing the exact moment through sheer determination and cunning manipulation of—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Farewell, Shūen,” Hylia whispered.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The words shattered Zelda’s thoughts. She looked again between the goddess’s weeping face and the scattered remains of the Demon King. Why address the Enemy with such—
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“…Oh,” Zelda said as the realization struck. “I suppose that would make sense.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
It seemed even Hylia was Hylian.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
A long, pained silence settled between them, and with it came understanding that cut deeper than any blade. The Mother’s tears continued to fall—each one a fractal eternity of grief shattering against the scorched earth. Hylia was wounded. Not physically—but spiritually. The pain in her eyes was achingly familiar: the same grief Zelda had felt when duty demanded sacrifice, when love and necessity opposed each other and no path forward existed without surrendering something precious.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I must ask you to carry an unfathomable burden, Zelda Numenia Proventia Hyrule,” the Mother Goddess said at last, her voice steady.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The full weight of it struck Zelda like a fall through ice into black water.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
This had <i>already happened</i>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She hadn’t accomplished anything by coming here. She had merely fulfilled a role written for her before her birth, before her world’s founding, before even the concept of Hyrule had taken shape in the ever-shifting currents of could-be.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Go, my child,” Hylia whispered. “Be the Warrior Queen that I could never be.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The words hung in the air between them—simultaneously command, plea, and benediction. Zelda felt something break open inside her chest, then. Something terrible and building. Her eyes narrowed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I am no warrior,” she said coldly, enunciating each syllable with deliberate precision. The venom-laced words tore from her throat before she could stop them, seething with a fury that had been smoldering since the moment she’d learned of her guardian’s fate. “<i>Impa</i> was a warrior!”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The Mother winced, lowering her head as if physically struck by Zelda’s words. “The mightiest of foes fell to her raw might and magical acumen,” she offered, her voice half-whisper.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda summoned the memory of lying in the infirmary like a shard of ice, letting it crystallize in her mind: “<i>She</i> was the <i>mother</i> I never had!”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Hylia gasped and dropped to one knee. “I did not intend offense, my child! I mean only to say that her death was a grave injustice.” Her voice carried with it genuine pain.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda balked, understanding forming in her mind with bitter clarity.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
It seemed even divinity was a scarce resource.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She wiped at her own tears—anguish and grief and anger mixing into something too complex to name. Her breath came ragged, but she forced her voice level. “Why Link?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Given your bond with Impa, he was the closest reciprocal counterbalance.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The question erupted from somewhere deep and primal. “That’s not—why not save Impa?!” 
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“In another world, I did, Zelda!” Hylia grasped her chest, bowing her head with a reverence that could almost pass for shame. “Just not yours.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda gasped. The confirmation of what she’d already suspected—that infinite variations played out across infinite worlds, that somewhere Impa lived while here she died…
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She took a moment to breathe, feeling the storm of emotion threatening to overwhelm her. She let it flow through her—acknowledging its presence without allowing it to consume her entirely.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“So then why not choose Link as your champion?” She asked, already suspecting the answer.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Hylia lowered herself further, palms now pressed to earth. The words went unspoken—but Zelda understood. And she realized too the symbolic weight of this moment: the Mother Goddess prostrating herself before her own Divine Majesty.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda stood frozen, the Godcleaver still thrumming with reality-defying power in her grip. Part of her—the part still aching with Impa’s absence—wanted to hold onto her anger, to make Hylia <i>feel</i> the weight of every choice. But another part, quieter and steadier, recognized the same awful truth she already knew: that even the divine power of the Mother Goddess wasn’t enough to save everyone. Hylia hadn’t chosen to spare Link and sacrifice Impa out of cruelty or indifference—Zelda simply found herself on the one side of fate where her guardian and protector fell while a hero and champion rose.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Understanding flowed through her. She released her hold on her weapon’s enhancement, letting the Void-darkness dissipate, allowing Fi to return to the aether. The sustained conceptual heightening fueled by the Golden Power and her own limitless magic withdrew like a receding tide. The reality-defying weapon returned to something more mundane—merely a legendary sword imbued with the power to banish evil.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
She tossed it aside. Steel clattered against stone, its light dimming to barely a glow.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I will not be a Warrior Queen,” Zelda said with quiet resolve.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Hylia’s composure shattered. Her shoulders shook with violent sobs—wrenching sounds too raw to come from a goddess. Yet threaded through the anguish came something else: breathless laughter, bright and disbelieving, joy and sorrow twining together. She pressed her palms harder against the scorched earth as if anchoring herself against the storm of emotion that consumed her—mourning what she’d lost while appearing to rejoice at Zelda’s proclamation.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda felt something twist in her chest—an unexpected sympathy born from witnessing pain so visceral, so utterly <i>mortal</i> in its raw intensity. She took an involuntary step forward, then halted. “What must I do?”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
There was a long silence as Hylia composed herself with visible effort.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“Go with my blessing, Zelda,” the Mother of Creation said, at once pleading and resolute. “Go and bring peace to the Realm.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Zelda glanced behind her at the scattered remnants that had been Demise—towards ash and dying flame and fragments of a dead god—then back to Hylia.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
“I was going to do that anyway.”
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Hylia laughed—a sound so meek and broken it barely deserved the name—even as her form began to dissolve into luminous mist that caught the burning light of the ravaged sky. “If only I had summoned you sooner,” she whispered, her words carrying the weight of infinite regret, of a goddess who had sacrificed everything and still felt it was not enough.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
Reality <i>twisted</i>.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The battlefield vanished. Time reversed its flow—not gradually, but all at once. Zelda felt herself ripped through layers of causality, backwards through the currents of temporal energy that had carried her here. The Gate’s power seized her, drew her back through the impossible distances she’d crossed.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
The grotto materialized around her as she fell onto her back. The Sentinels stood in their eternal vigil. The control panel gleamed with faint ethereal light exactly as she’d left it.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
And Zelda was alone once more, suspended in the Repository at the edge of the Void between Worlds, burdened by the weight of impossible knowledge and the echo of a goddess’s dying wish.
</span>
<br><br>
<span>
<i>Go with my blessing, Zelda. Go, and bring peace to the Realm.</i>
</span>
