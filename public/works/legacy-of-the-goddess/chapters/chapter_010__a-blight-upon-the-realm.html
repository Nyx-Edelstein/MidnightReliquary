<span><i>I am… I was the goddess called Avalia.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I do not know how this message finds you. I only pray that it does. Take heed, and listen: for more is at stake than you may know.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I was the grand culmination of my Mothers’ work. An artisanal masterpiece of Caelon’s design. An entity that could harness the combined might of their divine radiance without being destroyed. A singular will that could not be corrupted and turned against itself.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I was to be the guardian, steward, and protector of their realm. And yet, I failed in my task.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I wish I could tell you that some part of me knew it would happen. That I had ever questioned at all. That deep down in the depths of my being, some small voice had rebelled, had suspected.

<br><br>
<span><i>That first moment was when I had lost. My undoing… my demise… was borne of trust, and of love.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Do not underestimate the enemy, for he is desolation, and havoc; animosity, and betrayal; malice, incarnate. Do not make my mistake. I am now fractured; fragmented. A mere shadow of my former self, lost and adrift in the Void Between Worlds.</i></span>

<span><i>Please, I beg you: save my children. Protect them, where I could not. You must prevail. You must stop him. You must. For he will not stop. He will never stop.</i></span>

<br>
<span>A <b><i>crash</i></b> like the fist of an angry god slammed against the gatehouse, and the very foundations of the world shook with it. It came again. And again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A regiment of militia stood in loose formations in the courtyard ahead, lobbing javelins and firing arrows at the enemy over the walls. Ari held back with the rest of the regulars, pulse pounding and eager for battle. Around them, the streets had been barricaded save for a few lines leading back to the castle. There were four gates in all, one at each corner of the compass. Once theirs fell, their orders were to hold as long as possible in a fighting retreat. The enemy would be forced to funnel into bottlenecks, improving the odds considerably.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Blin had nearly overrun the defenders on the walls now, and were hurling down pellets from slings. The militia in the courtyard began to fall, dozens at a time. It wasn’t long before they broke.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><i>Crash.</i></b> <b><i>Crash.</i></b></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Archers, at the walls! Shields, hold the line!” the captain bellowed, rushing forward.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ready for the command, Ari was only a step behind. He dashed through the retreating militia, slid off to the side, and went down to one knee. Bracing himself, he drew an arrow and let loose. It hit true, piercing one of the beasts in the chest. The Blightkin fell from the wall, and Ari was ready with another shot just as more soldiers formed up around him. He let loose again, and soon arrows whizzed through the air. The Blin on the wall dropped like flies, and it wasn’t long before the walls were clear again.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><i>Crash—</i></b></span>
<br><br>
<span>The gate gave way—splinters and debris flying in all directions. Through the dust, Ari saw a dozen Dreadkin twice his size heave aside a massive battering ram. The brutish creatures backed away, and a veritable swarm of smaller Blightkin spewed forth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now!” the captain commanded. A switch released, dumping barrels of hot oil on the heads of the invaders. In the same instant, a fireball hurled across the courtyard and turned the mass of creatures into a blazing inferno. Charred corpses fell to the ground, and Ari felt a grim satisfaction as the brutish invaders met their end. The reprieve was short-lived, however, as another wave broke through the breach the moment the flames died down.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ready! Volley!” the captain commanded. Ari followed the command, firing an arrow downrange. Hundreds more followed. The bodies piled up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Yet another wave followed, and even more poured over the walls. Ari spotted a few Vilekin among them; substantially larger and heartier than the smaller ones, but not as big as the largest brutes. He aimed for one.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Again, volley!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The arrows flew, and javelins rained down en masse. Perhaps one in ten managed to survive this time. They charged headlong, heedless of the danger. Ari readied another arrow as the captain stepped forward to impale the chest of the largest skirmisher. The smaller ones around him balked, and were effortlessly cut to ribbons. More still poured through the gates in an endless stream, ever bigger and tougher than the fodder that came before. Many now had shields and armor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Archers, fire at will! Aim for the big ones!” the captain ordered, rejoining the line. “Shields, ready! Brace!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari let loose. Arrows whistled, and dozens of charging Blin dropped to the ground. It wasn’t enough. They crashed against the line, and the fight began in earnest.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla stilled her breathing as she applied pressure to a soldier’s wound, near the shoulder at the base of his neck. She tried her best to remain calm despite his writhing pain. Two aides held him down as she worked, and one held a wooden spoon between his teeth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Motes of green energy sparked to life around her hands, swirling in spiral patterns. She focused, pushing the healing energies through. Good—it was taking. The bleeding stemmed and the skin around the laceration knitted back together. A bit more, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>—No.</i> No, no, no! Not another one!</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched in horror as the wound tore itself back open. Dark blood oozed out, and the tissue around the cut turned a deep angry red.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wound had been inflicted with bloodrage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The soldier <i>screamed</i>, thrashing. Xayla fell back, her heart racing and eyes burning. She tried to wipe the sweat and tears from her eyes with her sleeve, but only managed to smear blood over her face. One of the aides called for a guard. She watched, numb, as the soldier strode up and plunged a sword into the blighted man’s heart. The screaming ceased, and the man fell limp. The guard shook his head, wiped off his blade, and returned to his post. The aides rolled the corpse onto a stretcher and carted it off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla braced herself against her knees, feeling dizzy and weak. She would have vomited again, except there was nothing left by now. She looked out over the infirmary. Ghastly. Nauseating. The carnage wrought by those wretched voidspawn was so much worse than anything she could have imagined.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She wanted so badly to just curl into a ball and scream and sob until it was over, but she knew she couldn’t do that. She had to continue. She <i>had</i> to. Her Green magic was a scarce resource, and wounded soldiers needed Healing. She wasn’t of much use otherwise—her place was here with the scant few like her that could be spared for the task.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uneasily, she stood. <i>Triage.</i> Next… next was…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace!” she heard someone call. “Your Grace, over here!” Xayla turned to see a tall, dark-skinned nurse beckoning her over to the storeroom. She nodded, steeling herself and making her way over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait—that nurse’s accent? Something about it was… off. Xayla paused just as she reached the doorway. Cautiously, she peered through. The woman was nowhere to be found.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla puzzled for a moment, then shook her head, turning to leave. She didn’t have time to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just a moment, Your Grace,” said a burly man in the doorway as Xayla nearly bumped into him. She stumbled back into the storeroom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla studied the man for a moment before recognition dawned. “Vesyrn?” It was one of the Veilwyrd commanders—Nira’s immediate superior. “What’s going on? Is something the matter? Where’s Nira?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He held up a hand and took a step forward. Xayla shied back. “Calm yourself, Princess,” he said. “It’s nothing urgent. You’re safe. We have important matters to discuss, is all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla narrowed her eyes, taking another step back. She didn’t know Nira’s location and so couldn’t use Telepathy to contact her, but she did have the Celestial Light. She used it, clasping her hands over her bracers and sending out a pulse.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Nira. I am in the storeroom of the infirmary. Vesyrn is here. Something isn’t right.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn groaned. “I wish you hadn’t done that, Princess. You leave me no choice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Danger. Escape. On my way,</i> came Nira’s response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh no.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Green energy crackled to life in Vesyrn’s raised hand. Xayla had no time to deflect it. She threw herself to the side, but the ball grazed her shoulder. Her whole body erupted in searing pain. Jolts of electricity shot through her arm, and her muscles spasmed violently. She tried to scream, but Vesyrn was already there, shoving a gag into her mouth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Helpless and writhing, she watched as he snatched the bracers off her arms and lifted the chain from her neck. What was he doing?! How could he?! Before she could process what was happening, the man was gone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The spasms subsided, and feeling returned to her limbs. Xayla pulled herself upright and tore the gag from her mouth. She stumbled from the storeroom, crying out for help. Within moments, four guardsmen rushed to her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace! What’s the alarm?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nira! Where’s Nira?!” she demanded, clutching at her throbbing shoulder.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here, Princess!” Nira yelled from across the courtyard, sprinting towards her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s eyes flashed blue. She could not risk saying the words aloud. <i>He has the fragments.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira slid to a halt. “Get her to safety! Now!” She yelled, taking off in the other direction without another word.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Stay low. Stay safe,</i> her response came. <i>I know where he’s going.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“This way, Your Grace,” one of the guardsmen said, leading the way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla followed, her hands shaking and nerves still on edge. She slipped a hand into her pocket, feeling for her mother’s locket. It was there—safe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The clasp had broken earlier in the day, and without time to repair it, she’d tucked it away for safekeeping. How fortuitous—almost absurd, really.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>So much blood. So much death.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari had never seen carnage on such a scale. They’d been fighting for what felt like hours. Soldiers lay dead and dying all around him. His company had broken through and secured a clear line back to the castle, but now was not the time to take in the scenery. He half-stumbled backward into formation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The captain barked an order. Ari and two dozen archers sprinted forward, then wheeled about and dropped to one knee with bows drawn. They loosed their arrows as the rest of the company passed through their ranks. Half the pursuers fell; the rest kept coming. Ari and the others leapt up and rushed back behind the next line of archers. His squad readied their bows again, but the remaining enemies had already been cut down. With no further pursuit, what was left of his company crossed the drawbridge to safety at a steady jog.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Winded, Ari stumbled out of formation and collapsed to the side. Most of the others did the same. Everything ached, though thankfully he hadn’t been injured. As he scanned the grounds, he realized his company was among the last to make it back. But their numbers were… far fewer than they should have been. That didn’t bode well. Had the other companies fared just as badly?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…still held up at the northwest gate. It’s a massacre,” he overheard. Soldiers posted at the bridge were conversing. Ari forced himself to his feet and shuffled closer so he could hear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But a whole regiment is still out there! What do we do?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nothing—our orders are clear.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you serious? We can’t just cut them off!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If the hordes draw any closer, we won’t have a choice. I don’t like it either, but orders are orders.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s response was immediate. Instinctual. Purpose stirred within him; a primal vigor urging him to action. <i>No,</i> was his only thought. Singular, defiant, decisive. <i>That will not happen. Not while I still breathe.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>His feet carried him to the stables, where he found and mounted an armored steed. Ignoring a call behind him to stop, Ari set off at a trot. Moments later, he drew up in the courtyard before the drawbridge.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At arms!” he bellowed. Around him, soldiers scrambled to their feet and looked to him expectantly, though murmurs rippled through the ranks when they noticed he wasn’t wearing an officer’s uniform.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s mind raced. <i>Quick, say something.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Form up!” he commanded. “We’re relieving the northwest gate!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Belay that order!” someone yelled in response. One of the soldiers at the gate jogged out to meet him. “I have direct orders from High Captain Raolin. No one is to leave the castle!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s jaw clenched. Fire and determination surged within, driving him forward. He would not be stopped—damned be the consequences. Drawing his sword, he leveled it at the man who dared stand in his way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You! Run, and tell the High Captain that his nephew has taken command!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Dumbfounded, the man drew back. He didn’t do as Ari commanded, but he did step aside and gesture for another to relay the message.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari tugged on his horse’s reins, wheeling about. “The rest of you!” he yelled, searching for the right words. “Our brothers and sisters are stranded out there, and they <i>need our help</i>! Any of you with a shred of honor will form up, and come with me!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The response wasn’t anything like what he expected. Perhaps fifty—sixty?—fell into formation. Another dozen made for the stables and rode up beside him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re with you, sir!” one of the riders called, raising his sword. The others yelled and stamped their feet in response.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t enough. It wasn’t nearly enough. But it would have to do.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Fueled by Red magic, Nira bounded across the battlements of the castle’s inner walls. She leapt from one platform, swung from a spire, and crashed through an upper-story window using a quick Burst to clear her way. She dove down a staircase and around a corner, dashing through the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The smell of burning flesh reached her before she saw the scene. Three guardsmen lay dead, felled mere moments before. Smoke rose from one whose chest bore a smoldering hole, jagged lines radiating outward from the point of impact. Another had been impaled with his own spear, and the last lay twitching in a pool of blood.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Vesyrn!</i> How could he?!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vian had suspected him of poisoning the King, and tasked Nira with uncovering the truth—and eventually confronting her once-master, killing him if necessary. But word came that Vesyrn had fled after Vian’s death and Allanah’s disappearance days prior. Foolishly, Nira had let down her guard. Now he’d attacked Xayla in broad daylight and stolen the fragments of the Goddesses’ Celestial Light for unknown ends. What could have driven him to betray his own order and the kingdom he’d sworn to protect?
</span>
<br><br>
<span>It didn’t matter. Whatever his reasons, she would see him answer for his crimes—and Goddesses willing, stop him before it was too late.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A torrent of energy exploded around her, consuming her completely. Her body twisted and morphed. Every inch of her skin screamed in agony as flesh thickened and clustered into scales. Fingers stretched into claws, teeth grew into jagged fangs, and spines erupted from her skull and neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her transformation complete, she surged forward and shattered the door to the King’s chambers. Vesyrn waited by the rafters, unleashing bolts of green energy. Nira weaved between his attacks and launched herself upward, seizing him by the torso and crashing through the ceiling to land hard on the tiled roof outside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She lost her grip in the struggle, and Vesyrn slipped free. Stumbling, she fell, but managed to slow her descent by raking her claws against the tiles. She spotted him fleeing along a walkway ahead and to the right. With three powerful leaps, she closed the distance to intercept.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vesyrn halted, raising his hands threateningly. “It doesn’t have to end like this, Nira!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira’s fury boiled over. This wasn’t the man she once knew. He had attacked Xayla—whatever his other crimes, that alone was unforgivable. She <i>pounced</i>, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>A column of ice sprung up from nowhere, barring her way. She coiled in midair and slammed her feet against it, arresting her momentum. The surface cracked, deep fractures running through its mass. Noises behind her caught her attention—two more had joined the fray. On instinct, Nira moved to seize better ground, but Vesyrn and his lackeys mirrored her movements, circling to cut off her escape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Listen to me!” Vesyrn yelled, “I would never harm the Princess, and we never had any intention to kill the King! We only wanted Xayla to take the crown!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You killed Vian!” Nira roared, her voice deep and guttural. “Allanah!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No! There are forces at play you do not understand!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That gave her pause. Could he be telling the truth?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He raised his hands placatingly and stepped closer, lowering his voice.“Listen, Nira, I don’t have time to explain. We need to get the fragments out of Castletown. My patron—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No!” she interrupted, voice rumbling. “You know I can’t let you do that!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She didn’t know what to believe about the rest. Her magically-altered form clouded her judgment, making it impossible to reason clearly. Yet she dared not drop the transformation—she already faced a desperate fight. Doing so would only seal her fate. But the fragments of the Sanctern… the Goddesses’ power made manifest? Wars had been fought over them. Kingdoms left in ruin. She would fight and die here if it meant keeping them from the wrong hands.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira steadied herself, weighing her options as she assessed her opponents.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Blightlands</i>, Nira!” Vesyrn yelled, falling back. “Don’t make me kill you!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>But her mind was made up. She would not be deceived. Whatever his motivations, he had attacked Xayla and murdered the guardsmen below—if he cared at all about the kingdom, he would never have done such things.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Ahead, Ari could see a mass of soldiers amid a sea of Blin. They were clustered tightly, fighting in the beetle formation with shields interlocked and rows of spears jutting out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded to the riders flanking him. This was it. He gave the signal, and they charged. Their mounts surged into a gallop, hooves thundering against stone. The company followed close behind on foot with roaring battle cries. Ari raised his sword high, directing the charge toward a gap in the enemy lines. They punched through with brutal force, scattering bodies and trampling those too slow to move. His infantry poured in behind them, securing the breach.</span>
<br><br>
<span>By the Mother, it was working! It was actually working!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari commanded the retreat, waving them through. “Let’s go! Move, move!” The stranded soldiers wasted no time. The side of the formation nearest him fanned out to cover the gap as those inside sprinted through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Blin advanced.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As he scanned the streets, a pellet ricocheted off his helmet with a sharp crack that snapped his head back and set his ears ringing. Too close—he’d likely exhausted his Luck. He quickly gathered his remaining reserves to refresh the effect.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari leapt from his horse and pulled his shield up for cover, ramming his sword into the chest of a foe attempting to flank a nearby soldier. He wrenched the blade free and cut down a smaller one that rushed him from ahead. A blur of movement caught his periphery—he ducked just in time beneath a mighty swing. In one fluid motion, he hacked away the brute’s leg and shoved the creature aside before falling back into stance. Another charged. Another fell by his blade.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were everywhere. Breathing heavily, Ari edged backward toward his support. So many of them…</span>
<br><br>
<span>A larger foe now stepped up to challenge him. This one was easily twice his size, and carried a club as thick as Ari’s leg. The creature’s eyes glowed red. Bloodrage. He would need to be careful. Even a glancing hit and he would be as good as dead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Dreadkin roared and swung wildly. Ari dodged once, twice, then braced himself as the club arced toward his head. He raised his shield to deflect, but the angle was off. The club <i>slammed</i> into his guard, sending a jolt of pain through his arm. The creature reared back for another swing, but Ari didn’t give it the chance. He dove in, his blade slicing through the creature’s stomach and clean through its spine.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lost in the chaos of battle, Ari realized he’d strayed too far from his allies. Panic crept in—if he didn’t act now, he’d be overwhelmed. He made a break for an opening—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—And it happened again. There was no mistaking it: a flash of insight, and the feeling of his consciousness floating in from nowhere to settle anew in his body. Ari threw himself to the ground. No sooner, a spear hurtled through the space he vacated to impale a hapless Blightkin a few paces ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That spear would have certainly killed him. Whatever it was he experienced just now was <i>not</i> simple Luck. His necklace—could it be?</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a rising sense of dread, Ari rose to his feet. He was completely surrounded now, but the Blin gave him a wide berth. They were chanting… cheering.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>ሁሁᏆᏌ! ሀᏲ-ሀᏘ-βᏓᏆᏁ. ሁሁᏆᏌ! ሀᏲ-ሀᏘ-βᏓᏆᏁ.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Hesitantly, he turned. At the far end of the throng stood the largest, meanest Blin he had ever laid eyes upon. It was a thing of tales and folklore. The hulking abomination towered above him, snarling. Cords of muscle and sinew rippled across its body. Its skin was painted with fresh blood, its eyes burned red, and it carried a battle axe that had to weigh more than Ari did himself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This had to be the Warlord. Ari knew he should retreat—every instinct he had screamed at him to do so. He had no hope against this… this <i>thing</i>. But if he was right… if there was even a chance he could fell the creature here and now…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Dear Goddess,</i> Ari prayed. <i>Holy Mother, guide my blade. I will be your champion.</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla stumbled along with guards at her side, every step sending fresh jolts of pain through her aching feet and shoulder. Blood and sweat caked her skin. Exhaustion weighed on her like a heavy cloak. Her mind raced, thoughts scattering as she struggled to pull herself together. She wanted so badly to <i>do something useful</i>—anything but this. If only she had acted sooner! Instead, here she was being shuffled to the inner sanctum like a helpless child, forced to cower and await news of her fate while the kingdom crumbled around her. How was Nira faring? Would the defenders hold?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was this the end?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She and her detail rounded the last corner and entered the sanctum. Her thoughts were interrupted by a sight she never expected to see—especially here of all places. A tall, dark-skinned woman stood before them, resting against a large glaive. She wore traditional Akhari armor: loose pantaloons and a form-fitting tunic over a light mail hauberk.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her guard reacted instantly, drawing their weapons and moving to engage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hold!” the woman said, with a thick accent. She raised her weapon, but fell back. “I am not your enemy! I have a message for the Princess!”</span> 
<br><br>
<span>“Drop your weapon and stand aside!” one of the guards commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait!” Xayla said, stepping forward. The guards refused to move, blocking her view. She recognized that voice—the “nurse” from earlier. Xayla had no idea what this was about, but she <i>needed</i> answers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your message? What is it?” she called out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Princess!” the Akhari woman responded. “The Lynx offers you her support, but you must come with me. We do not have much time. They will soon be upon us!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Who are ‘they?’” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Servants of the Exiled King,” she answered. “There is no time!” she said, growing frantic. “Come, you must—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Glass shattered from above. Six robed figures dropped onto the second story balcony—three with bows drawn, loosing arrows as the others charged down the steps.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Chaos erupted as arrows ricocheted off armor and bit into shields. One guard took a shaft to the shoulder before he could react. Xayla’s heart hammered as an arrow whistled past her ear. The injured guard pulled her back, covering them both with his shield. Another arrow struck with a heavy <i>thud</i>, embedding itself deep in the wood.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead, a melee ensued; Xayla couldn’t follow it. She and the injured guard scrambled backward. One of the assassins broke free and made a beeline for her. The guard at her side intercepted, locking weapons.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She acted on instinct, summoning a tide of Blue magic. An ice crystal erupted from the ground, impaling the attacker through the chest. The guard nodded to her and fell back to her side. Xayla immediately raised a sheet of ice for protection—and not a second too soon, as an arrow deflected off its curved surface.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Turning her attention back to the fight, Xayla watched in dawning horror as the rest of her guard fell one by one. Only the Akhari messenger and two attackers remained, locked in fierce combat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The messenger parried a strike and lunged forward, but her opponent ducked beneath the blow. In that instant, the archer loosed an arrow that caught the messenger in the neck. She stumbled, clutching desperately at the wound as blood gushed between her fingers, then collapsed to the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The assassins advanced.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No,</i> Xayla thought, panic rising.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her last remaining guardsman was injured, and she had exhausted her magic completely. They were hopelessly outmatched.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Avalia—Goddess Above!</i> Xayla prayed. <i>Please, don’t let it end like this!</i></span>
<br><br>

<span>Nira feinted toward Vesyrn, red sparks crackling around her clawed fist. Another ice barrier rose to protect him—but he wasn’t her true target. She pivoted sharply and hurled a blast of fire at the barrier’s caster. The woman barely threw herself clear of the flames in time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But the opening was all she needed. She dodged an incoming bolt of energy with ease, then closed the distance with a mighty leap. The woman scrambled to her feet, but Nira gave her no chance to react—plunging her clawed hand clean through her chest. Spinning around, Nira held the limp body as a shield against any further attacks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To her dismay, Vesyrn was fleeing once more. Now four foes barred her path—more Veilwyrd he had turned. One had transformed into a great horned beast. Red magic crackled in another’s hands, while arcs of electricity and blue swirls danced around the two in back. If the odds were bad before, she now faced certain death.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother Goddess</i>, Nira whispered under her breath. <i>Grant me strength. I cannot fail here.</i></span>

<span><i>Take heed, and listen: just as Avendal will surely fall without your intervention, the fate of all life is at stake. Do not underestimate the enemy, for he is far greater than you may realize.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I regret that I cannot aid you directly. I can only bequeath to you what little power I have left. You must choose your champion, and you must guide them in your quest.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Do you choose Ari? A courageous hero. Selfless, and determined. A young veteran, and a natural leader. He will slay a Warlord and turn the tide of battle without further bloodshed. With him as your champion, you need not fear even the deepest abyss. Even so, he is just one man…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Or would you choose Nira? A fierce Veilwyrd warrior. Powerful, and devoted. Her skills are wide and varied. She will recover the stolen fragments of the Celestial Light: two of Mind, and one of Will. With her as your champion, even the mightiest of foes will fall before you. Be that as it may; violence cannot solve all problems…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Or is Xayla your choice? An idealistic dreamer. Ingenious, and clever. The Crown Princess of Avendal, and my own blood. With her magic, she will rally the defense and bring ruin to the enemy—but at great cost. With her as your champion, you will have the resources of a kingdom at your disposal. But she is no warrior…</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Each of them would serve you well. I regret I have not the power for you to aid them all. And so, you must choose.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I pray you choose well.</i></span>
<br><br>
