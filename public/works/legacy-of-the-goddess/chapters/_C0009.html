<span>Carefully, and with all due consideration of the threat from fiends, Link made his way through the thick brush around camp. After a day’s worth of travel from the temple, they’d stopped in-between the banks of Lake Hylia and the surrounding woods. Link had taken a small scouting party to comb the area while the others set up camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>If he was being honest with himself, this level of precaution wasn’t strictly necessary. They had <i>six</i> Sheikah around to guard the Queen, and twenty-six perfectly capable guardsmen besides. A fiend (or twelve) was hardly worth the concern. Truth be told, he was feeling somewhat superfluous with that kind of muscle around. He understood perfectly well Zelda’s paranoia—she had after all just been the target of an assassination attempt not two weeks prior—but even he had to admit this was overkill.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Still, he couldn’t be satisfied that he had fully discharged his duty until the surrounding area had been canvassed to regulatory standards. After all, it was always better to be proactive than to have something large and deadly blunder into camp overnight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sound of a branch snapping nearby grabbed his attention. Link whirled about, ready to meet the threat with an arrow drawn from his quiver. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cove pivot and leap forward, he too ready to face whatever threat had—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ack! Sorry, sorry!” Burdah said sheepishly, holding up his hands. “Don’t shoot! Just bad footing. It’s been hours, and to be frank I’m getting a bit tired.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link sighed, returning the arrow to his quiver. By his reckoning, they were about half an hour away from the main camp at a brisk walking pace. Scouting to that distance on foot <i>was</i> a bit excessive, even he had to admit. There didn’t seem to be much out here, and stumbling around through the woods in the dark of night for much longer wouldn’t do them any good if they were starting to tire out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, I think we’ve done enough,” Link said. “Let’s head back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“’Bout time!” Cove said jovially, jogging over to give him a pat on the back. Link rolled his eyes. He appreciated Cove’s enthusiasm, his skill, and at times his company, but more often than not he could be a bit much to handle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey buddy. Since we’re no longer on duty looking out for all manner of terrible nasties, mind if I ask you a question?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Go ahead,” Link said, already regretting it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What’s going on between you and the Queen?” he said, wagging his eyebrows.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nothing’s going on between me and the Queen,” Link grunted. “It’s not like that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, I’m just sayin’. You two spend an awful lot of time together. Alone. In private. With no one else around.” He gave Link a wink and a nudge on the shoulder. “<i>C’mon!</i> What’s it like? Just between us. And for the record, ‘Nothing’s going on,’ is exactly what you would say if there were—in fact—something going on. You can’t deny that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seriously,” Link said, stepping over a pile of leaves and brushing away a low-hanging branch. “It’s nothing. Knock it off, okay?” He knew Cove meant well, but by the Mother if he wasn’t a strain on the nerves.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fiiiine,” Cove said, his expression dropping to an exaggerated frown with shoulders hunched. Link knew better than to be taken in. “Sorry, if I offended,” he said. “Just trying to pass the time.” </span>
<br><br>
<span>They were approaching the treeline now. Just a couple more minutes and they’d be back in sight of camp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So you’re a Lightsworn now, I hear,” Cove said eventually, when Link refused to take his bait. “What’s that like?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t know. Not yet. I’m not one yet” Link replied, slowing to a halt. Something was off. He could feel it. But what?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, come on. How can you be so sure? You don’t feel any different? Don’t you feel the power of the Holy Mother surging through you with each and every beat of your heart? How sure are you that you can’t turn evildoers into stone at the slightest glance?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh, that’d be something,” Link said, musing. He turned his head, trying to make out what it was that got his attention.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Look, let’s just get back to camp, okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aye, I’m ready to be done with this shite,” Burdah said, joining in. “Can’t wait to get some decent food. And some shut-eye before dawn would be nice, too. If it’s all the same to you, that is. No offense, sir.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>His tone was amicable enough, but Link recognized the rebuke, gentle as it was. The soldier had a point.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine, fine,” Cove said, throwing up his hands in exasperation. “I’ll lay off it. Let’s get on with it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The trio ventured forth out of the trees and headed towards camp along the banks of the lake. The shore was mostly empty, save for some crags in the distance and a boulder a ways in front. Link could just barely make out the flickering lights of campfire in the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Everything was fine. That was, until the boulder took a few steps away from them. Link held his hand up, and the other two stopped in their tracks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That,” Burdah whispered, “looks to be a kodongo.” He carefully placed his waterskin on the ground and readied his spear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No sudden movements,” Link said. “If we’re lucky, it’ll go on its way and won’t bother us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The beast in question was definitely a younger member of the species, only being about the size of two grown men. A quadrupedal, lizard-like creature, with a scaly hide that tapered off to a stubby tail at it’s rear end. Link noted it was chewing on some plant or another, knife-length fangs glistening in the moonlight as the rest of its jaw masticated away. He noted the length of the horn on its snout; definitely an adolescent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s not moving,” Cove whispered after about a minute. “I don’t think we have a choice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grunted and drew his sword; arrows would do little to nothing against the creature’s thick hide. He motioned for Cove to sweep left and Burdah to go right, as he cautiously stalked up to the creature head-on. Three paces. Eight. Twelve. The other two followed suit. It didn’t yet seem to notice them. Steady, they continued. Link’s hair stood on end. He was ready to fly into action at the slightest provocation. He knew kodongos could charge from a dead stop faster than a loosed arrow, on land or in water.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At last, they were in place. Link nodded to the other two, and with a shout, he ran forward, thrusting his sword into the creature’s neck. At the same instant from his left, Cove came barrelling toward their target. Sparks of red energy flew from his fist, and he buried his arm deep in the creature’s chest. Simultaneously, Burdah’s spear caught true, piercing straight through the kodongo’s temple and out the other side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It barely had time to let out a pathetic whine before it jerked violently and collapsed to the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link pulled his sword free, wiping it clean.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gross,” Cove muttered, shaking blood and gore from his arm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, dammit,” Burdah cursed. “Tip broke off my best spear.” He muttered something else unintelligible. “You two go on ahead,” he said. “Left my waterskin back on the shore. I’ll catch up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grunted his acknowledgement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So. What do you want to do with the carcass?” Cove asked as he sniffed his hand and turned his nose. “I reckon we should skin it. The leather’s hella useful, and the meat’ll make fine jerky.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“AAAAAHHHHH!”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>He was moving almost before it happened, shouting for the soldier to get back. Burdah managed to dodge the first charge, but wound up diving face-first into the dirt. The beast—far bigger, meaner, and nastier than its younger kin—skidded to a stop, throwing up a massive plume of dirt. It brandished its large horn and bared its dagger-like fangs with a challenging roar. The thing towered over Burdah as the middle-aged soldier clambered to his feet. Unarmed, Link put his odds of surviving a head-on attack somewhere between nil and not good.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s legs and chest burned from the exertion as he scrambled to close the distance. He knew he wouldn’t make it. He knew he wouldn’t be able to get there in time, and that someone else was going to get hurt on his watch again. That someone was going to <i>die</i> on his watch, <i>again</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>No!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>That wasn’t going to happen. Not this time. He would be fast enough this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The moment stretched out to eternity. Burdah raised his arms over his head to protect himself. The beast tensed, muscles rippling under its scaly hide, ready to snap forward and crush the man underfoot like a twig. Link held his sword high, gritting his teeth and preparing to strike.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>He had to be faster.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Like the key of a lock falling into place, something inside him <i>clicked</i>. A response to a need, spoken in the right language for the world itself to understand. His will called out, and his magic answered with <i>power</i>. His feet pounded divots in the ground, and he tore forward at blistering speed. The great lizard turned its head in challenge to the new threat—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—But it was too late.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“HYAAAHHH!” Link shouted, pouring every fibre of his being into the attack. His sword severed flesh and bone with a single precision strike, and another dead carcass hit the ground, decapitated cleanly at the neck. Link slid to a stop a few feet away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Panting. Dizzy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link wobbled. His insides felt like they were on fire. Exhausted, he let his blood-soaked sword slip from his grip as he fell to one knee. When he caught his breath and regained his bearings, Burdah and Cove were staring at him in awe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not a Lightsworn, huh?” Cove said, eyes wide. “One more question before I shut up for the night, sir. Where do I sign up?”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“You should’ve seen it! He was like <i>woosh!</i> and the kodongo was like <i>RAAAWR!</i> and then he was all <i>HYAAH!</i> and HE KILLED IT IN ONE STRIKE!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda watched with fascination as Cove recounted the tale to the delight of the dozen or so soldiers gathered around the campfire. Link, for his part, seemed to be doing his best to disappear as the men around him raved and hollered with the occasional clap on the shoulder or slap on the back. Poor guy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gentlemen! I believe Arlinkar has had enough for now,” Zelda said, raising her voice to be heard. “Give him some space, please!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link raised his head an inch or two, gratitude showing plainly on his face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine, fine. You heard the Queen! Let’s let ’em be, lads!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Three cheers for the Hero of Castletown!” one of the soldiers exclaimed, raising a flask in toast.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“To the Queen’s Champion!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Here here!” / “’eyy! Haha!” / “Now there’s a good lad!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda couldn’t help but smile. It wasn’t every day her champion awoke as a Lightsworn, and she was glad to see her retinue in good spirits. Most of the soldiers dispersed shortly thereafter, and Link waved to her as he left for his tent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, Link! Just a moment,” she said, raising a hand as she called after him. Her curiosity was getting the better of her. She could always ask her questions later, but she knew it would be more difficult to sleep with her mind busy. Link halted and spun around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Something wrong?” he asked, looking concerned.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No—I just had some questions, if you don’t mind?” she said. “I know you’re probably tired. It can wait until morning if you’d rather sleep.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, of course,” he said, walking back and taking a seat nearby so they could converse at a more comfortable volume. “I doubt I’ll get to sleep right away anyway. Happy to answer any questions. But if it’s about the magic stuff, I don’t think I know any more than you do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Curious…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda waved away an approaching guard. Whatever it was, it could wait. Someone else offered her a drink and she turned it down. “Have you had training in other magics?” she asked. “I thought you only had Green affinity. Though I suppose you’ve seen plenty of Red mages in combat…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. I mean, yeah. Er, only Green,” he said, visibly struggling to get his thoughts in order. “Honestly, I don’t know what I did or how I did it. It kind of just happened.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So what, you just used Invigorate out of nowhere?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shrugged. “Yeah, seems like.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Fascinating.</i>” It went without saying that Zelda was envious. It took her years of training to be able to use Red magic at all, and here he was displaying peerless mastery on his first attempt. Using it in combat like that—in conjunction with a weapon, no less—was no small feat. People like Impa and Cove trained their whole lives to be able to do the things they did. If he was one of the best swordsmen in the kingdom before, he now had no rival.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Someone got her attention out of the corner of her eye. Grenja looked to be starting up his knife antics again, and Zelda signaled to Koja to keep him from getting too carried away. This lot—it was almost more trouble than it was worth having so many Sheikah around. “So can you use other magics too? she asked, half distracted. “Have you tried Telepathy? Transformation?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I haven’t tried, no,” Link said, scratching his head. “And if I can, I don’t even know where I’d start. Like I said, I don’t know how I did it. I just needed to get to Burdah faster, and I felt… I felt like my magic just <i>answered</i>. It gave me exactly what I needed in the moment.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh.” So not only did he have other affinities, but he could use magic he had never practiced intuitively. Zelda’s thoughts went immediately to the forgotten arts. “Do you think if we set up the right circumstances, you might be able to use other abilities? Like Stasis?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not sure?” he said. “But I’d be up for trying it. —I don’t want to put anyone in danger, though,” he hurried to amend.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, no. Of course not,” Zelda huffed. She <i>supposed</i> the situation wasn’t <i>that</i> dire. Yet. Besides, if they had to, she was sure she could concoct a scenario where Link only believed someone to be in danger.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Hmm. But would that even work? Would she need to fool Link, or <i>Link’s magic</i>?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Seriously,” Link said, glaring at her. “I don’t want anyone to get hurt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised her palms in a placating gesture. “No one has to get hurt, Link,” she said, smiling. “We’ll think of something.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” he said. “We can try.” He nodded in affirmation, though somewhat hesitantly.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They probably needed to get to bed soon. It was still four?—Five days to Last Bastion, and keeping up a good pace was rough going. She had so many questions though! And she was eager to see Link get proper training.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re set to arrive in Kakariko tomorrow, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just before sundown, yeah. Earlier if we continue to make good time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded. “I know we’re on the move right now and we don’t have much time to spare, but I want to see you properly trained at the earliest opportunity,” she said. She held up a finger, preempting his objection. “We have more than enough hands to handle the grunt work around camp—you can use that time to train instead. I can teach you the basics of Blue magic myself. Grenja should be able to handle Red, and Koja can help you shore up your Green training where it might be lacking. And once we’re back at Castletown, I’ll see to it you have access to the best instructors available. I’m sure I don’t have to tell <i>you</i> of all people this, but having a combat-capable mage as skilled as you with all affinities is kind of a big deal.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh, yeah” he said, blushing. “And I really appreciate that. I’ll put everything I have into training, I promise. Though I don’t want to get my hopes up. I mean, it would be weird if I didn’t, considering the circumstances. Have all the affinities, I mean. Still…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Humble to a fault, as always. Zelda admired that about him. So many other men would be full of themselves, were they in his shoes right now. She wasn’t sure he fully understood his place in the world, and how much he potential he had to change the future of their kingdom for the better. Or maybe he did, and that was in part why he was so level-headed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was just so <i>dedicated</i>. Selfless. Compassionate. Though he always pushed himself too hard, and often forgot to take care of himself, to the point he had to be reminded—or commanded—to relax and recuperate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It wasn’t as if Zelda couldn’t relate to that. Goddesses knew she struggled with the fact that she wasn’t more competent. That she was so small, and that even in her role as Queen there were hard limits on what she could do and what she could accomplish. Though looking at it from that angle, she supposed she probably was too harsh on herself most of the time…</span>
<br><br>
<span>She glanced over at Grenja with his massive ego and bullish bravado, currently in the act of juggling knives to impress the others. Koja with her impish whimsy and carefree, lackadaisical nature. Cove with his faux innocence and playful exuberance that he leaned so heavily into. And Ryn, hiding away at the edges of camp, yet watching everyone and everything still. They all had their ways of coping with the harshness of reality, she knew.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But Link? He never let his limitations get in the way. Nothing ever bothered him, and everything he did was for the greater good. She tried to see the world through his eyes. Here was a man who was willing to go to damnation and back in the name of duty. <i>Literally</i>. He was willing to endure excruciating agony at the drop of a hat, and even die if need be, in service of his kingdom. This was the same man who led sixty soldiers in a suicide charge to save an entire regiment during a hopeless battle—<i>and succeeded</i>. For him, no risk was too great, as long as it made sense that someone take it. And in his logic—a hero’s logic—that someone might as well be him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But what was it that motivated him to be so self-sacrficing? He <i>cared</i>, she knew. But so did she. Most did—excluding literal psychopaths, but they were the exception. Most people, under the hardened exterior they had developed to survive in the world, were good at heart. But however noble, they were also selfish—at least a little bit, from time to time. Herself included.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But him? No; his dedication to service bordered on fanaticism. —And the more she thought about it, the clearer it was. No one was that selfless by nature. No one got that way without reason. What had he been through? What had he <i>done</i>? What was he trying to prove? Not to the world, for he never cared about perception or the opinions of others. What was it he wanted so desperately to prove <i>to himself?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Usually I’m the quiet one,” he said softly, looking Zelda over with those pensive eyes of his. “What did I do this time? I know you’re worried about me. I can tell.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started. She had to remind herself how perceptive he was. Precious little ever escaped his notice. …Was that why he was so awkward, socially? What would it be like, to be so attuned to every minute detail of your environment, never able to turn it off?</span>
<br><br>
<span>In a word? <i>Overwhelming</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just thinking,” she said. “I’m not worried—no more than usual, at least. Just curious. Trying to understand you better.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh. There’s not much to understand,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t believe that at all,” she said flatly. “I think you’re just so used to being written off that you’ve stopped trying to be understood.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He grunted, but didn’t otherwise respond. She was probably pushing too hard. She knew he would just clam up again if she wasn’t careful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>How could she get him to open up?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hm. Maybe being more direct actually was the answer. She hadn’t tried that. It might work? She just had to do it in a way that didn’t provoke him. Didn’t make him feel threatened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link?” He looked up, curious. She had his attention. “Don’t feel like you have to answer right away. Or at all,” she said. “And know that whatever your answer is, however you choose to respond, I won’t judge you for it. As long as you speak the truth—genuinely, from your heart—there is absolutely nothing you can say that will make me think less of you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can’t say I like where this is going,” he said, somewhat anxiously. “But alright. Hit me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What happened, that made you decide to enlist at Talus?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You’re right,” he said abruptly, standing to leave. “I don’t want to talk about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey, it’s okay. I’m not—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know,” he said, interrupting. “I’m going to bed. Am I right in assuming we can practice Blue magic while riding?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda wanted to speak out, wanted to try and reason with him, but stopped herself. Now wasn’t the time. She nodded. “Yes. We can do that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good. Then we can get an early start.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” she said, resting her head in her hands. Maybe afterwards she would have some time to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>—Thinking quickly, she drew upon her magic. The past few weeks she had been recovering from exhaustion, and had grown accustomed to not relying on it. But now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She recalled the moment when she held his tattered and dying body in her arms. She focused on how she felt then, singing to him as she cried. Of how she poured her own soul into trying to save him. She brought that intention to the fore of her mind, and let out a soothing pulse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodnight, Link,” she said softly, just loud enough to be heard. “I apologize if I’ve offended you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it’s alright,” he said with a sigh. He visibly relaxed as the tension left him. “You haven’t. It’s just… sensitive. I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but I’d really rather not talk about it right now.” He looked back to her searchingly. She nodded, reassuring. “Maybe another time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course. No pressure,” she said. “I’m looking forward to your training tomorrow.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Me too,” he said with a grin. “Goodnight, Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goodnight.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched him go.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was this progress? Or was it an impending disaster? Only time would tell. She could tell something dark was buried very deep within him. Perhaps it was best not to probe. Whatever twisted knot he managed to tie himself into, it seemed to work well enough for him. <i>For the most part</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But Zelda would be remiss if she didn’t at least try. Someone had to look out for him. Someone had to care for him. He deserved that much.</span>
<br>
