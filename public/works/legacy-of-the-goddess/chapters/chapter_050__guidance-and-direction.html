<span>“There isn’t much to say,” Ari said, his gaze distant. “I was about to go after the Warlord when Uncle Raolin came bursting through with four other soldiers. He was shouting something in their language—I couldn’t understand it.” He shook his head. “The throng just… parted for him. And then the Warlord started laughing. I didn’t know what was happening. Uncle was yelling at me to fall back, but I couldn’t leave him there. I tried to fight, but the other soldiers dragged me away.” He paused. “After that, it was over. The Warlord left and the rest of them swarmed us. We tried to hold out. I was the last one standing when you showed up. I suppose you know the rest.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded as Ari recounted his tale. She could only imagine what it was like to go through such an ordeal. “I’m so very sorry to hear that,” she offered after a solemn pause. “I didn’t know Raolin personally, but I heard only great things about him. Our kingdom is darker for his passing.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>An uncomfortable silence stretched between them.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you,” Ari said at last.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shifted in her seat and took a sip of her wine before setting it down. Her fingers tapped nervously on the table. He was a difficult one to read, and he certainly wasn’t making this easy on her. But she had to know—preferably sooner rather than later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Have you given any thought to my offer?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head. “No.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>No?! How dare he! Xayla felt a flash of indignation, but quickly suppressed it as she watched him shy away. She needed to tread carefully—she couldn’t risk alienating him. It wasn’t over yet. There was still a chance to win him over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari,” she said, her voice softening with genuine empathy. “Please, hear me out. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you. I <i>need</i> someone like you at my side. You would be one of the most influential men in the kingdom!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He sighed, looking visibly conflicted. Good—she could work with that. Xayla placed her hands on the table and leaned forward, hoping to catch his eye with a friendly smile, though he wouldn’t meet her gaze.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, I understand,” he said after a long moment of contemplation. “And under other circumstances I would likely accept. But this? It just isn’t for me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla let out a weary sigh. What could she possibly say to that?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s just—people are still out there fighting,” he said with a gesture. “Dying. There are people who will die if I don’t help. They need me. I have to go back as soon as I’m able.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari—<i>I</i> need you,” Xayla said. “You’ve already gone far and above your duty.” She paused, searching for the right words. She was about to say that there were plenty of soldiers left to fight in his stead, but she knew that wasn’t exactly true.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I admire your dedication, and your sense of honor. But you can do just as much for the kingdom as my personal champion, if not more. As Queen, it is <i>my</i> ultimate responsibility to see our people safe. My responsibility to heal the damage and undo the destruction wrought by the Blight. And I am offering <i>you</i> the chance to take direct part in that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She studied him carefully, but couldn’t get a read on him. He was completely opaque to her. What else could she use to tip the scales in her favor? By all appearances, he wasn’t motivated by glory, titles, fame, or prestige. More money likely wouldn’t sway him either.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps she needed to be more open with him? More vulnerable. She didn’t relish the idea, but it might work—get him thinking of her as another helpless soul in need of saving. It wasn’t even that far from the truth, especially since…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raw emotion welled up within her—unprocessed and immediate. She let just enough surface to be visible: enough to proceed without risk of falling apart again, enough to bring tears to her eyes, enough to put a strain in her voice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari. Like you, I lost someone very dear to me. She was the older sister I never had—the closest thing to a mother I knew, since my own died so many years ago.” She touched her hand to her chest. “Nira was always there for me. She always watched my back. And now…” Her voice faltered. “Now she’s gone, and the Veilwyrd are in disarray. There are scant few I can trust. Not a week ago, I was the target of an assassination attempt—and I have no reason to believe they’ll stop there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was listening now—rapt with attention. She had him right where she wanted him. Time for the finishing touch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m scared, Ari,” she said. “Avalia saved me once, but I can’t count on divine intervention every time my life is in danger. She must have sent me to save you for a reason—and if not this, then what?” She paused, letting her vulnerability show. “I need your help. Will you help me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I can confirm—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Aah!” Xayla jumped, and a blur of motion sent her reeling. Before she knew it, Null had vanished and Ari was at her side holding his cane at guard, urging her to stay behind him. Her thoughts caught up to her, and she burst out laughing just as her guard detail came streaming into the study, barking orders. It was all so absurd.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright! Everyone!” Xayla yelled, standing and raising her hands in a placating gesture. “Calm down. It’s okay. There’s no cause for alarm!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you sure? We heard—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Izu,” Xayla interrupted. “Thank you for your concern. I applaud your swift action, but everything is fine. Please—return to your posts. And do not allow anyone to enter this room until further notice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you command, Your Grace,” Izu said, bowing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The captain and the other soldiers left the room, leaving her alone with the beleaguered veteran brandishing his walking cane as if it were a sword. Xayla frowned and shook her head. Were she not still recovering from exhaustion, she would have felt compelled to Soothe his poor soul.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>I must ask that you request Ari refrain from further assault,</i> Null’s voice echoed in her mind. <i>Manifesting in a form capable of interacting with you both requires substantial power, and another attack may delay my ability to communicate for several days.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey—it’s alright, Ari,” Xayla said gently. “That was Null. She’s the Emissary of the Holy Mother. I haven’t heard from her in some time, but it’s likely she has important information to share.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stammered and dropped his cane. “You mean I just attacked the Emissary of Avalia?!” His face flushed crimson—he looked ready to die of embarrassment on the spot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla had to suppress a giggle at his expense. “It would appear so. But not to worry—no harm done, and she’s unlikely to take offense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari took a moment to process that before shuffling back to his seat. Xayla smiled reassuringly and handed him his cane, which he accepted with a quiet word of thanks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe it’s safe now, Null,” Xayla called out, returning to her own seat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The ephemeral specter materialized at the side of the table. “Apologies,” her voice echoed, “For the purposes of calibrating future interaction, would you classify that as a ‘dramatic entrance?‘”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is she always like that?” Ari asked, staring in open wonder at the chromatic entity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla smiled to herself. “You’ll get used to it,” she said, turning her attention back to Null. “And yes, I would say that was quite dramatic. Though you really must give us more warning before popping in like that—it can be rather disconcerting for us mere mortals.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Noted,” Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait—” Xayla said, the realization dawning on her. “Why was your ‘manifestation’ interrupted just then, but it wasn’t when I attacked you with my magic?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait—you did <i>what</i>?” Ari asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla, I request that you exercise patience. I will be happy to answer your query, but there are more pertinent matters to discuss first.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmph.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” Xayla said. “You know, I’ve been calling for you for a while now? I hope you have a good reason for ignoring me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed I do. Unfortunately, it is my duty to inform you that Avalia’s power is spent, and she is no more."</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>What?!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Avalia’s dead?!"</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Xayla said. “You must be mistaken. How can that be?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Unfortunately, I am not. Her Grace expended the last of her strength in empowering you, and in ensuring the armies progressed in fighting back the Blin invasion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari sputtered. “But—no—that can’t be—how is that even—” He took a breath to steady himself. “We have to tell someone!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Xayla said firmly, cutting him off with a sharp look. “I’ll speak with the High Priestess myself.” She held his gaze, making sure he understood the gravity of her words. “This matter stays between us. Understood?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, okay,” Ari said hastily. “I mean, uh—yes, Your Grace. As you command.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is more,” Null said, recapturing their attention with a twirl. “Xayla: you have an unparalleled mind, considerable ambition, and a deep compassion for your kingdom. You have have earned Caelon’s favor, and have bonded with a piece of Mind. With her final act, Her Grace, the Goddess Avalia, has chosen you as her personal champion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla gaped. Avalia’s personal champion? Being Queen wasn’t enough?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari:” Null continued. “You are a peerless warrior, a natural leader, and your courage is second to none. You are Nenore’s chosen, and have bonded with a piece of Spirit.” Ari’s hand went immediately to his chest. Xayla’s eyes widened. <i>He had a fragment of Spirit?!</i> That would explain a few things. “Avalia wishes for you to guard and protect Xayla, and to keep her safe from harm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Show me,” Xayla commanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari hesitated, then slowly drew out his necklace. A jagged fragment of gold—much the same as the one Xayla bore in her locket. There was no mistaking it. Nenore’s chosen indeed. She had believed the fragments of Spirit to be wholly lost to time, but this changed everything.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought came unbidden, and Xayla couldn’t stop herself. The pain was too raw—too immediate. “What about Nira?” she demanded, her voice rising. “She was every bit Ari’s equal. She was pursuing Vesyrn—who has stolen not one, but <i>three</i> fragments of the Celestial Light. If the fragments are so important, then why let her die? Wouldn’t she have been Vaka’s chosen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla tried to control herself—tried to bite back the vitriol—but she wasn’t doing a very good job of it. She could only imagine how she must look to the poor man sitting across from her. Arlinkar, for his part, remained silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say with certainty,” Null said. “Her Grace did not share the details of her plans with me. I can only surmise that she chose as best she could given the limited options available at the time. It is highly probable that any deviation would have resulted in catastrophe. Nira’s death, while tragic, may have been unavoidable—preventing it may have meant the fall of Avendal itself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla clenched her fists beneath the table, her jaw tight. Perhaps if her mind were clearer—if this didn’t involve her so personally—she might have accepted that reasoning. But she couldn’t shake the feeling that Avalia had never truly cared about their people at all. She felt used. Like a tool, and nothing more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have additional information to share regarding to Nira, if you would like,” Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s attention immediately went to Ari. Did he need to hear this? “Can it wait until later?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The information concerns Ari as well,” Null replied. “He is as integral to Avalia’s plans as you are, Xayla.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” Xayla said with a sigh. “Go on, then.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Null finished her accounting. Xayla sat back in her seat, feeling overwhelmed. There was so much to take in—she had lost track of how many times her world had been upended during this conversation alone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I have more to share,” Null said. “Please inform me when you are ready to proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>More?</i>” Xayla glanced over at Ari. He had withdrawn into himself, his expression unreadable. She wasn’t sure what to make of him. She was barely holding herself together under this barrage of revelations—what must he be thinking?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just… give me a moment,” Xayla said, reaching for a thin stack of papers. She dipped her quill and began scribbling furiously, jotting down her current thoughts and all the threads she needed to follow up on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, I’m ready,” she said after a moment, quill poised. “You were saying?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I must now inform you of my abilities,” Null began. “They will be available to you as needed, subject to certain limitations.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My primary function was to assist Avalia in communicating with her subjects in this realm, and I possess several abilities to this effect. I may telepathically communicate with you—Xayla—though the same ability incurs much greater cost with those who do not bear Avalia’s mark.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked up, eyebrows raised. “What do you mean by ‘cost’? Is it different from Blue magic? And what exactly is ‘Avalia’s mark’?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null <i>hummed</i>, and her prismatic skin rippled through shifting hues. “I will explain. Divine Power is a type of energy that exists in the spiritual realm—analogous to the magic of your realm. I am able to use this power to affect your world in ways not unlike your own magic, though the mechanisms differ substantially. My access to Divine Power here is limited, but Avalia was able to mark individuals in this realm to act as agents of her will and as conduits for Divine Power. My ability to use that power here stems from these marks—the two are fundamentally intertwined, and my capabilities vary based on their presence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded, jotting down the highlights and trying to keep pace.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null went on. “Most directly, I am able to convert Divine Power to magic and bestow it upon those who bear Avalia’s mark. I am also able to expend power to manifest an avatar and communicate directly with marked individuals. Telepathy remains the most cost-efficient for simple communication, though protracted conversations may necessitate an avatar.” She spun about with a pirouette. “With substantially higher cost, I am able to manifest in this ethereal form you see before you—one capable of interacting with any being in this realm, regardless of whether they bear Avalia’s mark. However, this form is somewhat delicate and easily dispersed by physical or magical force.” Ari groaned, resting his head against the table. Null hummed again, her colors rippling through violet and rose.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Xayla:” Null said. She looked up from her note-taking. “It is worth noting that you are currently the only individual bearing Avalia’s mark in this realm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Xayla said, considering. “And is this what you meant earlier by being chosen as Avalia’s champion?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That is precisely correct,” Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla nodded. “You also mentioned that those bearing Avalia’s mark act as ‘fonts’ for Divine Power in this realm. Can you explain how that works?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Null tilted her head. “It is a complicated matter. I am not certain I can explain it in terms you will understand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Could you at least try?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I will attempt to do so,” Null said. Her skin rippled through shifting hues—violet, rose, lavender, deep blue—before settling back to neutral. Her voice took on a strange echo, and her words seemed to carry more weight than mere utterances. “ᏪᏨᎲᎤᎣ’ ᏇᏨᏍ’ᎤᏨᎤᎧ ᏯᏅᏅᏍ’ ᏡᎤᎾᏅᎺᎺᏬ ᏯᎺ ᏪᏅᏮ’ᏡᏨᏨᎲ’ ᎹᎤᎤᏫᏫ ᎲᏫᏅᏅᎤᎾᏫᏯ ᎧᏫᏮ’ ᏊᎾᏇ’ᏫᎤᏨ ᏬᎤᏅᏯ’ᎤᏨᏅ ᎧᏨ ᏭᎺᏬ’ ᏬᎤᏅᏯ’ᎤᏨᏅ ᎣᏨᏈ’ᏫᏬ ᏬᏫᏨ ᏑᎾᏫᎲ’ᏅᏫ ᏡᏅᎤᏫᎣ’ᏨᏅᎲ ᎧᎺᏫᏅᏯ ᏮᏫᎤᏫ ᏍᏫᏮ’ᏅᏨᏫᏯ ᏍᎤᏫᏛ’ᎤᏫᏨᏬ ᏭᏨᏫᏯᏫ ᏑᎺᏫᏡ’ᎤᏅᏫ ᏑᏅᏅᏫᎤ ᎧᏨ ᏮᏫᎤᏫ ᏑᏅᏫᎤᏮ’ᎺᏫᎤ ᏈᎺᏨ ᏮᏫᏨᏬ’ ᏭᎺᏭᎤᏫᎤ~ᏬᏅ ᎧᏨ ᏮᏫᎤᏫ ᏍᎤᎧᏫᏯ’ᏫᏫᎾᏮ ᏯᏅᎺᏅᏯ ᏯᎾᏇ’ᎧᏫᏨᏫᏅᎤᎤᏪᏫᏨᏅᎾ ᏯᏅᏅᏍ’ ᏡᎤᎾᏅᎺᎺᏬ ᏑᎺᏫᏡ’ᎤᏅᏫ ᏮᏅᎺᏭ’ᏯᏨᏫᏅᏯᎤᏫᏍ’~ᏇᏨ ᎧᏨ ᏊᏫᏑ’ᎤᏅᏪ ᏭᎺᏭᎤᏫᎤ~ᏬᏅ”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you get any of that?” Ari asked, looking completely befuddled. Xayla had almost forgotten he was there.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not a word,” she said with a sigh. She hadn’t been expecting Null to literally start speaking a foreign language, and gave up attempting to transcribe the syllables halfway through.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Apologies,” Null said. “As I indicated, I cannot explain the precise mechanics. However, for practical purposes, you may think of it this way: heroic actions befitting a Champion of Avalia will grant me greater access to Divine Power, which I may then use to assist you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Huh.</i> Okay. That sort of made sense? Xayla jotted down her thoughts, tapping pensively at her chin. When she thought of <i>heroism</i>, she wasn’t exactly the first person to come to mind—but surely Avalia hadn’t expected her to go galivanting off on adventures to slay monsters? Being Queen had to count for something, right? She sighed and looked up from her notes. This was a lot to keep track of, and even more responsibility being dumped in her lap.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you for the clarifications, Null,” she said. A thought occurred to her. “One more question before you continue: you mentioned ‘marks,’ plural. With Avalia gone, are you or I able to place additional marks?” She noticed Ari perk up at the question.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A short pause as Null spun once, twice in the air, shifting through teal and purple as she moved. “Analysis suggests the capability likely exists,” she said. “However, the feat likely requires far more power than is currently available to me. I could conduct a preliminary assessment—approximately two hours of uninterrupted time with Ari present would allow me to provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of the power required to mark him. We may proceed at your discretion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I mean, I’m free now if you want to try it?” Ari offered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not now, but soon,” Xayla said, shaking her head. She noted Ari’s visible disappointment with interest—another small window into what motivated him. She would definitely follow up on that later, but for now she needed to extract as much information from Null as possible before the emissary vanished again. “Do you have any other abilities we should know about, Null?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do,” Null said. “With substantial cost, I may compel some creatures or beings to perform simple actions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait—like <i>mind-control</i>?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not quite,” Null answered. “The effect is significantly weaker on more intelligent beings, and fails entirely if the subject is unwilling or would knowingly act against their own interest. The cost also scales with the subject’s mental complexity.” She spun once, her hues shifting from teal to purple. “Perhaps ‘mind suggestion’ would be a more fitting description.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That wasn’t terrifying in the least. Xayla made notes to follow up later. ”Anything else?“ she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uncertain,” Null said, her hues briefly shifting to rose and violet before settling back to neutral. “After Avalia’s passing, I lost access to much of my former knowledge and memories. It’s quite possible I have other abilities, but I lack sufficient information to say what they might be.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Interesting. Now that she thought about it, there were quite a few items in the historical record worth investigating further—especially given recent revelations. And with this new potential source of information at her disposal…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I were to present you with myths, legends, historical accounts of magical artifacts—that sort of thing—would you be able to tell me if any of them matched abilities you once had, or abilities that Avalia bestowed to her champions in ages past?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say for certain, but it is a distinct possibility,” Null said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well. That wasn’t the answer she was hoping for, but it was better than nothing. Besides, a bit of research wouldn’t hurt—it might even provide a much-needed reprieve from all the stress.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think I get it,” Ari said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked up from her notes. “Get what?” she asked curiously.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I prayed to Avalia that day. When I faced the Warlord, I asked her to guide my blade. I told her I would be her champion.” He frowned. “It didn’t work out the way I imagined it would. But I think I understand now. We have to have faith—this is all part of Avalia’s plan. Isn’t that right, Null?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That interpretation is consistent with available data,” Null said, floating to rest horizontally in the air. Xayla got the impression she was studying Ari with intense scrutiny. “However, I cannot provide further guidance on this matter. Whatever plans Avalia had for either of you, it falls to you to determine your own path forward.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s mind swirled with weighty thoughts and unanswered questions. There was so much she didn’t know—and Null had only raised more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ve been thinking,” Ari said. “With the Veilwyrd out of commission, maybe I should be the one to pursue Vesyrn and investigate the assassins? That seems like it would fall under my duties as the Queen’s Champion, yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait—he said yes! <i>Yes!</i> He actually accepted! Xayla struggled to remain calm and collected, forcing herself not to grin like an idiot. She snatched up a fresh leaf of paper and began penning out a writ. “I think that is a <i>wonderful</i> idea,” she said, barely able to contain her excitement. “Most excellent. Oh, and Ari?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Call me ‘Xayla,’ please. But only in private, of course.” She winked. She preferred to keep some level of familiarity with those closest to her—it was much easier to deal with people when they treated her as a person, rather than some abstract ideal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s face went flush. “Okay, Xayla.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla finished the writ, folded the paper, and stamped it with her personal seal. “Here,” she said, handing it to him. “Take this to Chancellor Nyllara, the Queen’s Law. She’ll make it official.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari nodded, taking the missive. “Should I go now, or…?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned to Null. “Is there anything else we need to discuss with Ari before he goes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Negative,” Null said. “I have conveyed all that was meant to be conveyed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari rose, bowing his head as he did.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you again, Ari,” Xayla said with a nod. “I am certain we will speak again soon.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My pleasure to serve.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He turned to leave, and Xayla watched him go. His gaunt figure, the clack of his cane, the way he favored one side—all stark reminders that he was still recovering. What was she thinking, ordering him around in this state?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait—Ari!” she called after him, her pity getting the best of her. “You should take a few more days to rest before you start. I’m sorry—I have a habit of getting ahead of myself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He stopped, turning back over his shoulder. “But, don’t I need to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, I’ll have someone else handle it for now,” she said, waving him off. “Go on—get some rest. And make sure you eat something. Ask any of the servants and they’ll bring whatever you want to your quarters.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded, looking equal parts relieved and disappointed. “Okay. Thank you, Xayla. I will.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari left, and Xayla found herself alone with the chromatic specter, who had taken to dancing in circles on thin air. She wondered briefly what Null did when she wasn’t manifesting herself—but no, that was a question for another time. She had enough to think about already.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Null?” Xayla called out. “Before you go—I still have so many questions. Are you going to disappear on me again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you require further assistance or have additional questions, I will always be available, though in limited capacity depending on power reserves.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” Xayla said, watching as the specter faded abruptly from view, leaving her alone in her study.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She yawned and stretched, downing the last of her wine. Ari’s glass sat untouched—no use letting it go to waste. She finished that off too. So much to think about. So many notes to go over. So much to do. And the research—where should she even begin?</span>

<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Some of the oldest folktales tell of a hidden race of people known as the Dimi, who were so small as to be impossible to see with the naked eye. Legend has it that the people of Farwatch possessed a magical hat that allowed the wearer to see and communicate with the Dimi, who aided the kingdom in discovering traitors.</span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> The Cane of Yr</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> An item of immense power, said to have been entrusted to the people of Yr by Avalia herself when the Dominion of Yr was founded. Legend says it was capable of deflecting magical attacks, invigorating its wielder, and protecting them from all harm.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Apparently it was used as a symbol of power and authority in the Old Kingdom and was lost following the Blin invasion. Notably, any mundane object imbued with enough magic can deflect magical attacks. But what of the other effects? Possibly worth following up on.</span>

<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> A pair of magical rings said to bind the hearts and minds of true lovers together, allowing them to share thoughts and feelings even at great distances.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> While it’s possible items like these exist, I suspect it may just be a cover for use of fragments of Mind.</span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> The Basilisk’s Gaze</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> A common myth says that the Lightsworn of yore could freeze their enemies to stone with little more than a glance.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Although it’s well known that much magical lore has been lost to time, this ability doesn’t fit with our current understanding of the chromatic magics. Perhaps it was something entirely different? Or perhaps it never existed at all.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> The Frozen Armies</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Legends say that Avalia once descended from above and froze two entire armies in place until their leaders could agree to an armistice.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Could be linked to tales about the Basilisk’s Gaze?</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> The Spyglass of Revelation</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> An artifact said to be used by the inquisitors of Farwatch to peer into infinity, allowing them to discover truth, make the incorporeal real, and pierce all illusion.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> I forget the exact source of this one, but I’ve always found it intriguing.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Pendant of Amethyst Sands</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> A pendant said to be worn by a powerful bloodmage named Moraga, who supposedly spearheaded the Akharic rebellion. Legend has it the pendant gave her eternal life in exchange for the souls of those she killed.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Interesting, but likely little more than a scary tale told to children.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> The Champion’s Trials</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> A common element of many folktales. In them, a hero journeys far and wide, fighting wicked monsters, completing harrowing challenges, and unlocking their true potential as they earn the Goddesses’ favor.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> I find it odd that this is such a prevalent theme. Could there be something real behind it?</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Aghan’s Ring of Dominion</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> A ring that was said to put the wearer under the spell of its creator, forcing them to do their bidding. Allegedly used by Aghan, a senator of the Dominion of Yr, to control and hold sway over his political opponents.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> A ring matching the exact description from a painting and that of several reliable historical accounts was confirmed and cataloged by the Lorekeepers in year 171 of the Forsaken Era, but was subsequently lost. Their notes suggest the ring to be a completely mundane item. Perhaps its power had simply waned, or the source of Aghan’s ability was something else entirely. Or maybe it was all made up. Could this be related to the power of compulsion that Null mentioned?</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Vaka’s Gauntlets</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Gauntlets said to have been worn by the goddess Vaka with the power to unlock the true potential of the wearer, allowing them to perform supernatural feats of strength.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Almost certainly a misdirection for use of fragments of Will—and a poor one at that.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Fae</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> The oldest folktales speak of marvelous and beautiful creatures known as Fae. In these grand tales, the Faerie Queen—for she always takes the appearance of a beautiful, scantily clad woman—presides over some village, blessing the lands with fertile soil and granting its peoples luck, happiness, and long life. In exchange, the people need only make humble offerings to maintain her favor, and thus ensure their continued prosperity.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> I’ve been meaning to look more into this. Curious how abruptly tales of and references to Fae fell out of favor.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Magical Rods</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Older tales commonly feature rods that could channel magic directly. In these tales, the rods were usable even by those without magical affinity and without training.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Seems to be plausible, at least. Bursting is a well-known and widely used application of magic. There is no known way of Imbuing an object such that it can accomplish the same feat, but it’s entirely believable that the knowledge of how to do so has simply been lost and yet to be rediscovered—though certainly not for lack of trying. It could also be pure folktale, made up to appeal to commoners. Who knows?</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> The Caelydri’s Tunic</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Mentioned in a few folktales. In them, a hero is granted a magical tunic by the Caelydri people as thanks for his aid. Supposedly it allows for underwater breathing.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Who knows, where the Caelydri are concerned.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Sandals of Ascension</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Supposedly these winged sandals were a gift from Avalia to Queen Nialay Proventia Xayla Avendar of Farwatch. They were said to allow the queen to ascend into the sky and speak directly with the Holy Mother, where she witnessed the birth of the Realm.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> All manner of nonsense can be found if you go back far enough. I hesitate to include this one, and do so only because it is well known that Nialay was a founder of the Lightsworn order and supposedly a direct descendant of Avalia.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> The Hero of Gales</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> A common folktale tells of a hero who could hurl pebbles from a sling with such ferocity that they could shatter boulders, break storms, and disperse rains. In the story, the hero uses this power to defeat a gigantic sea serpent that terrorized the coastlands. In some versions this was the hero’s own power, and in others it was that of his magical artifact.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> Likely fantastical embellishment, though the specificity is intriguing. I’m including this because similar wild feats appear across multiple unrelated sources—curious if there’s a common thread.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Soulsteel</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Folklore</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Some accounts of the Blin invasion refer to terrible voidspawn bearing weapons made of “soulsteel.” They claim the most powerful of Blin warriors forged these weapons from their own souls, and that any wounds inflicted by them would never heal. Some accounts further claim that these weapons could effortlessly cleave through even the toughest metal.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> This is almost certainly little more than the result of embellishment and hyperbole stemming from accounts of bloodrage that grew over the ages.</span>
<span><hr></span>

<span><b><u>Item:</u></b> Aethyrius, the Voidbreaker</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Classification:</u></b> Magical Artifact</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Description:</u></b> Also known as “the Blade of Celestial Reckoning” and “the Blade of Celestial Reckoning” A common element in many legends—said to have the power to banish evil to the depths of the Void. Legend says that only a true hero can wield it; any others would immediately die upon touching it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Some stories say the hero who stood against the hordes at the Sacred Temple of the Mother Goddess bore this very blade, and further claim it was the only weapon capable of countering soulsteel.</span>
<br><br>
<span><b><u>Notes:</u></b> The reference to the hero’s stand is indeed an actual historical event which took place around the year 508 of the Forsaken Era. The fall of the temple is widely regarded by historians as the symbolic and final end of the Old Kingdom.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But a sword that destroys evil? How absurd. How could a sword tell the difference between good and evil? I hesitate to include this one, except for the reference to countering soulsteel. Now that I know magic is capable of curing bloodrage, perhaps this merits further investigation.</span>
<br><br>

<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Raised voices stirred Xayla from her slumber. She groaned. Her head was pounding. Worse, one of her reading candles had melted all over a page of <i>Ithin’s Tales</i>. Now she would need to…</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Wait. Mothers’ mercy—what time was it? She scrambled from her chair to peek through the shutters. The midday sun sent nearly her reeling. “Gahh!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick. Fick, fick, fick, fick! She was late for court—by at least an hour. With Adresin commanding the northern forces and Nyllara overseeing reconstruction efforts, she was the only official who could legally call the proceedings to order.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She hurried to the basin and splashed water on her face, scrubbing it clean with a washcloth before checking her reflection. Not her best day. Her hair was tangled, but she managed to hide the worst by pulling it into a tail. Okay. She could do this. She just needed to—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The door to the hallway below burst open. “<i>Xayla!</i> Your Royal Highness, get down here this instant!” came the voice of Countess Lensa. Xayla winced. She really wasn’t doing herself any favors today.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Coming, coming!” she called, making her way down the stairs. “Sorry, Lensa. I just got caught up in research, and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t need to hear it, Your Grace. Just… ugh. Look. You have <i>responsibility</i> now. You can’t—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I know, I know,” Xayla said, throwing her hands in the air in defeat. “I’ll do better. I promise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lensa sighed, looking around. “Where’s your handmaiden?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Anli? I don’t know. I haven’t seen her since—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Never mind,” Lensa said, rubbing her temple. “I’ll send one of my own girls to attend you. Just…” She stood with her hands on her hips, looking Xayla over with a critical eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla felt like her face could burst into flames at any moment. Why was she so bad at this? Why had the Goddesses deemed fit to curse her so?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Your Grace, thank you for hearing me. With the destruction of the eastern fiefdoms, we’ve been absolutely inundated with refugees. House Kah has done <i>far more</i> than our share in lodging and caring for the underprivileged. We’ve had thirteen violent crimes on our property this week alone! And just this morning I was forced to order the execution of a poor beggar boy—he injured one of my guardsmen trying to steal from our grain stores…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“To summarize,” the merchant continued, “with the supply lines disrupted, we simply cannot meet our quota this month. Your Grace, I cannot continue to operate at a loss like this. We need a remission on the tariffs, or I’ll be forced to declare insolvency…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“As we all well know, the frost came early this year,” the farmer said, clutching his hat nervously before him. “Last year’s harvest was already poor, and now this. We know the taxes must be paid—no doubt. But we’ve heard tell of your Greeneries, Your Grace, and we were hoping you might come and bless our crops…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla skimmed the charges. Abandoning post. Theft of martial supplies. Assaulting a guardsman. Blasphemy. Insulting the Royal Family. Wearing improper attire to court? She rubbed her forehead. Who even wrote these laws?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How do you plead?” she asked, woefully.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Guilty, Your Grace,” the soldier said, falling to his knees. “I have confessed my sins before the Mother, and I seek atonement. Please, Your Grace—have mercy!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She sighed, paging through the papers. The penalty for desertion in time of war was usually death, but the kingdom couldn’t afford to make examples at present. Blasphemy typically warranted branding—or even removal of the tongue, depending on severity. Assault charges varied based on the station of both offender and victim, and the nature of the offense itself. Insulting the Crown meant twenty lashes and a day in the stocks. Was that still on the books?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla looked him over. By all appearances, he was just a scared, angry kid who’d lost his nerve and made some bad choices. No one had actually been harmed—Avalia least of all. Well, except for the guardsman who’d gotten a black eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She glanced over at Taetus, who watched her expectantly. He was no doubt waiting for her to pronounce a harsh sentence. Lensa wouldn’t meet her eye.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A thought came to her. Why not solve two problems at once?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well,” she said. “I hereby strip you of all lands, ranks, titles, and holdings. You will serve six years of indentured servitude to House Kah, and you are to abide by all lawful orders from your new master.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you! Thank you, Your Grace!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla turned to the older noble at the side of the room. “Lord Dannek, does this arrangement suit you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He bowed, clasping his hands together. “It does indeed, Your Grace. Thank you. I’ll put him to good use.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“I’m afraid morale has never been worse,” the bishop said. “Your people are fearful—for their lives, their property, their families, their <i>children</i>. Most crimes aren’t committed out of malice or disdain for the law, but out of fear and desperation. Surely you can see this? I beg you, Your Grace—please, you need only let them know the Crown is looking out for them…”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Your Grace, I have no petition to make,” the wounded soldier said, prostrating himself before her as best he could with his arm in a splint. “I’ve come only to give thanks—for saving the kingdom, for saving my life and the lives of so many others.” His voice rang with reverence. “Praise be unto Avalia! Praise be unto Queen Xayla, her champion!” The room echoed his cry.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla felt warmth rise to her cheeks as she smiled, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief. It heartened her to know that at least some of her subjects appreciated what she’d done. “You are most welcome, sir,” she said, motioning for the room to settle. “Please, rise. And know that the Crown is grateful for your service. As ever, I act only for the good of our people, and for the kingdom.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As you say, Your Grace,” the man said. He struggled to his feet, and a younger man came to his aid. Xayla motioned for the next petitioner, but the soldier stood his ground. “As you well know,” he said, continuing to address her, “we still fight to contain and push back the Blight. <i>Pray tell</i>, Your Grace. When will you be joining us on the front?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla scoffed, taken aback by his audacity. The question hung in the air for only a moment before another voice rang out: “Yeah, when?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Council chambers erupted. Xayla sat stunned, at a loss for words. They clearly believed her capable of much more than she actually was. Was it prudent to publicly admit her own weakness? What of their enemies? And dare she tell them about the fate of Avalia?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Order!” Lensa commanded, her voice cutting through the din. “The chamber will come to order! That is enough for today—bailiff, clear the floor."</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“The southern forces are working to contain further incursions from Talus, but the fighting around the floodplains remains fierce,” Wymar informed them. “As you all know, Adresin has already departed with an advance force, and I’ll be leaving soon with the remainder.” He turned to Xayla. “Your Grace, I wouldn’t ask if the situation weren’t dire, but we need every able-bodied fighter we can muster.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla didn’t like the sound of that—not at all. “What is it, Lord General?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We still have the problem of the Veilwyrd,” he said. “With your permission, I’d like to use them to bolster our forces. We can send the most unproven among them to serve on the front lines.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Granted,” she said. It was an unorthodox request, but entirely reasonable.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And half the Royal Guard,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What?!” Xayla’s eyes widened. She was still under threat from assassins, and she barely had two hundred guardsmen left to defend the castle! “What?!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I understand your concern, Your Grace,” he said, gesturing with one hand. “I wouldn’t ask if the situation weren’t dire. But these are among our most skilled fighters, and every experienced blade we can deploy significantly improves our chances. In the meantime, I recommend relocating to Arikton—we can ensure your safety far more effectively there, and—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Are you mad?” Lensa interrupted. “Unthinkable! The Queen abandoning the city, at a time like this? The people would be calling for <i>all</i> our heads! We can’t have it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“With respect, Countess,” Wymar said sharply, “the final decision rests with our queen.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla shook her head, caught between the two arguments. Both made sense in their own way, but she had no idea what to decide. “Let me think about it,” she said at last.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar and Lensa both nodded, though neither looked pleased.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another councilor spoke up. Roldath? Or was it Rissu? “Your Grace, Bishop Olo made a fine point. If you can spare the time, I urge you to meet with your people—a few speeches, perhaps some personal meetings with the Noble Houses. I would be happy to draft some words for you. It will go a long way toward easing their fears.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you,” Xayla said. “Yes, please do so. I’ll see what I can do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace?” Taetus. Xayla mentally readied herself for what was to come.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, Counselor?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do not wish to put too fine a point on it, but you have much to attend to as of late. With both Nyllara and Adresin unavailable, perhaps it would be prudent to grant either myself or Countess Oda temporary authority to administer court in your absence? At least until the situation stabilizes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That <i>ficking</i> snake, always looking for another opportunity to expand his influence. Though if she was being honest, she would appreciate the reprieve—which somehow made it all the worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fine,” she said with a weary sigh. “Have the writ on my desk by morning.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Your Grace,” he said. “Oh—and one more matter.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus shook his head with a rueful smile. “A lone Akhari rider delivered a message to Last Bastion, addressed to you personally. It’s from someone calling themselves ‘Naibi, First of the Sunseekers.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla’s brow furrowed. First of the Sunseekers? The title had an oddly familiar ring to it—reminiscent of “First of the Lightsworn,” an ancient position whose sworn duty was to be the first to answer Avalia’s call. Could the Akhari have maintained a similar tradition? And what did they want?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Taetus unrolled a parchment, reading it aloud. “I come bearing a message for the new Queen. The Lynx offers you her aid, and the Sunseekers will stand to call. Allow us to lend aid to our long-lost siblings in these dark times. We much desire to see a rider on a white horse with your reply.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rolled up the message and tucked it away. Whispers and laughter broke out in the small chamber. “First of the Sunseekers? The Lynx?” he asked, making little effort to hide his disdain. “Odd—very odd. Does this mean anything to you, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hesitated, uncertain how much to reveal—or who in this room could be trusted with what information. She tapped her chin thoughtfully, her gaze sweeping across the assembled councilors. When her eyes met Taetus’s, she quickly looked away. “I’m not certain, Counselor. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I’ll need time to consider my response.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If I may return to the matter of clearing and reconstruction,” someone said. “I would like to motion—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Excuse me,” Xayla interrupted, lost in thought. “Thank you all, but I must retire. There is much on my mind, and so many decisions to be made. Counselor Taetus, you have the floor.”</span>
<br><br>
