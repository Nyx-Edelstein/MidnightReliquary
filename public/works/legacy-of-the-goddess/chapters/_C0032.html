<span>Zelda came to a stop at the doors to her study. Shesan waited for her inside.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her heart thrummed in her chest as she reached for the door handle. She hesitated, and her fingers flit nervously. She turned to pace back and forth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She wanted, needed, and had no choice but to speak with the Fae, but also she had no idea how this worked. Was Lucia in control of Shesan now? How did Shesan make contact in the first place? It had to be through Vesyrn, right?</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Was that something Fi could learn to do?</span>
<br><br>
<span>But more pertinently—could Lucia possess <i>someone else</i>? Had Shesan been aware of this possibility? Had she been coerced? What was Zelda risking by having this meeting?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had to remind herself that Lucia once came to Hyrule’s aid during the Gerudo Wars, in one of the kingdom’s darkest moments. The <i>official</i> recounting was that Hylia herself descended from the heavens and put a stop to fighting, allowing leaders on both sides of the conflict to come to an agreement. However, Vestele insisted that it was not Hylia who came to their aid, but Lucia. The very same entity waiting for her on the other side of these doors.</span>
<br><br>
<span>How powerful was this Fae? Could she help them turn the tide against the enemy?</span>
<br><br>
<span>And if so, what would she demand in return?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a deep breath and stood tall. There was only one way to find out, and time was ticking. They’d have little privacy on the journey south. She wasn’t sure how long they had before needing to leave, but it wasn’t enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She pushed the doors open and stepped inside, letting them close shut behind her. Inside, Shesan sat at the meeting table by the hearth with her legs crossed, sipping tea and perusing one of Zelda’s journals.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda strolled over, snatched her journal back, and pulled out a chair.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello again, Zelda,” Shesan said, seemingly unaffected.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan,” Zelda answered warily as she sat down. “It is still Shesan in there, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan snorted and treated Zelda to a smug grin as she set the cup down on the table. “I’m not possessed, if that’s what you’re asking.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda tensed. That wasn’t a clear answer, and the exchange earlier seemed to indicate otherwise. Fi wasn’t alerting her to a potential lie, but that didn’t mean—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh. Look, there’s nothing—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—How do I know I can trust you?” Zelda said, cutting her off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan leaned forward, placing both palms on the table. “That’s a good question,” she said. “And you’re right to be suspicious. My answer to that is the same as it’s always been: actions, not words.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed her skeptically. “Then what was that earlier? That sounded exactly like how Link described Urik’s possession.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan leaned back and tossed one leg over the other. “Technically speaking, the term would be ‘coinhabitance,’ as it refers to a voluntary compact and not an involuntary one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uh-huh. “Can it <i>become</i> involuntary?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan waved a hand. “Not really. It’s complicated—not worth worrying about.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda wasn’t so sure about that, but it answered one question at least. “So you trust her, then?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A shrug. “As much as I trust anyone, sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That wasn’t saying much. “And what did she do to earn your trust?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan grinned. “It’s more about what she wants, and what she hasn’t done to get it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda cocked her head and narrowed her eyes. She was about to complain about never getting straight answers, but stopped short as she noticed Shesan tense up and glance away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Perhaps a different tack? She relaxed into her seat. Maybe if—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This would probably work better if you spoke to her directly,” Shesan said before Zelda had a chance to gather her thoughts. “You and I rarely see eye to eye.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. That was a surprising degree of awareness for her. Was she showing… respect?  Zelda sat forward and laced her fingers together, setting her chin atop them as she pondered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay then,” she said after a moment. “How does that work?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan rolled her eyes with a huff as she extended a hand across the table. Cautiously, Zelda took it, knowing what to expect by now.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The world flashed white as she was transported somewhere else.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She blinked as she took in their surroundings. They stood on nothing, in the middle of a dull-grey, featureless landscape. Shesan held her hand, occupying roughly the same place she had at the table. Zelda let go and turned to her left. There floated a faintly glowing figure with long silver hair, scantily clad in a mesh of vines and leaves. Metallic shackles with shifting chromatic hues bound the Fae’s wrists, but the chains did not connect to anything and dangled freely in the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Fae, Lucia, held her arms wide with palms up, but said nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda looked back at Shesan with concern.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A symbolic gesture,” Shesan said. “Those have more meaning in this place. You’ll see.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded slowly as she felt pieces clicking into place. —Wait, no. She shook her head vigorously. “Where is ‘this place?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good question,” Shesan said. “I believe you would call it the ‘Spiritual Realm,’ but of that I’m not certain.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even if so, that didn’t tell her much.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda sighed. Okay. Taking that at face value… somehow, symbolic gestures meant “more” here. Palpably more, yes. She could <i>feel</i> it, even if it didn’t quite make sense and she couldn’t quite explain it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. She turned again to Lucia. Still floating impassively, arms outstretched. Welcoming. Inviting.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let her instincts take over. She stepped forward and extended a hand. The Fae shook it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well met, Zelda,” Lucia said, dropping a foot and a half to stand on the… nothing. They were roughly the same height, Zelda noted. And she looked exactly like Niesis.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You know who I am?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia nodded. “And you know who I am.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was not phrased as a question, but Zelda found herself nodding anyway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She asked the very first question that came to mind. “Earlier, you mentioned you were ‘looking forward to working with me again.’ When was the last time we worked together, and how did it go?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia opened her mouth to speak, then stopped and smiled. “Pray tell, what year is it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised an eyebrow. She didn’t know? “Year 548 of the Common Era.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia continued to smile impassively. “Allow me to rephrase. How long has it been since Basilius Rhomar took up the crown?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, that piqued her interest. She supposed Hylian calendar time wouldn’t make much sense if Lucia had lived—or was previously more active?—in a different era, and had been locked away all this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shook her head slightly as she refocused. She was having trouble concentrating. “That would have been… Year 414 of the Forsaken Era,” she answered. “So in absolute terms… 765 years ago.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia laughed with a playful glint in her eye. “Then that is your answer.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So the legends are true?” Zelda asked, though she felt she already knew the answer. Lucia had all but confirmed it with her last question.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That depends,” the Fae said. “Which legends, specifically?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Reaffirmation? The legend of the Frozen Armies, and how…” Wait. She shook her head again as her thoughts caught up to her. There was something about this place—something strange, where things just <i>made more sense</i> than they normally did, and yet somehow didn’t make sense at all. “Hold on,” she said, raising a finger. “Those were my <i>ancestors</i>. Are you saying I’m the reincarnation of Queen Cordatia Hyrule?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“More or less,” Lucia said with an upturned hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But that doesn’t answer my question,” Zelda said, trying not to show any frustration. She wasn’t frustrated—not really—she just wanted a clear answer. “What does it <i>mean</i> to be… a reincarnation of…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stopped mid thought as she felt something tugging within her that expanded to encompass the whole of her attention. Lines flowing outward from her being that wove into a fabric, extending into the past and unwinding again to individual threads that terminated at her ancestors. The structure was <i>there</i> in her mind, and yet it was not. She could feel its abstract, symbolic meaning, even as every bit of it fell apart under rational scrutiny.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Huh,” she said aloud.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You are the Blood of Hylia, yes?” Lucia asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So in a sense, you <i>are</i> what remains of the Goddess Hylia in this world.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She felt something then. A glimpse of something strange. Something wonderful. Something beautiful. But the whole of its meaning evaded her grasp. Zelda sighed as she buried her face in her palms. “I believe you, I do. But I still don’t understand what that means, in practical terms.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Give it time, and you may,” Lucia said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So many questions. And every answer yielded more still. “But what does that make you? A Fae?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it you think you know of Fae?” Lucia asked with an impish grin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda paused to collect her thoughts. She decided it was best to be truthful and honest. “Vestele—the current High Priestess of the Hylian Faith—told me they were… that you are… shells, she said. Husks. Fragments of Hylia that broke off from her, traveled through the Void, and made their way here. —To our world, I mean,” she amended as she glanced about. “She said that you sometimes have her memories, but rarely do you care for us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia gave a single nod. “I was ‘born’ when Cordatia’s mother, Justitia Venias was murdered, along with her brother, King Domhall Gavrillius, and his wife and their two infant daughters. Those deaths left behind a Void. I am that which filled that Void.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda was just about to ask, “A void in what?” when she felt the answer instead.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Perfect stillness. Absolute emptiness. Unchanging. Forever. Eternal. Infinite.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She shuddered. She had pondered this concept before, and the memory of that cold emptiness chilled her to the bone. She thought back to her half-remembered fever dreams at the Temple of Time. “Does that mean you have memories from when you were Hylia?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“In a manner of speaking,” Lucia said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda considered for a long moment and composed her next query carefully. “Care to enlighten me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia laughed again, though this time it was more amusement than joy. “That would be too dangerous for you, I fear. I do not wish to risk it. Perhaps when you have bonded the other fragments of Wisdom, we can speak of this again.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” Zelda said, unsure exactly what to make of that. Another thought came to her, and she decided to voice it. “My father was murdered,” she said solemnly. “Did that also leave behind a Void? …Is there another Fae we should be on the lookout for?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia turned to Shesan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No. It’s unlikely, anyway,” Shesan said. “Best not to worry about it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s heart sank.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was she imagining it, or did it darken a shade just now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You have more questions for me,” Lucia said. Again, a statement, not a question.</span>
<br><br>
<span>So many questions. Where to begin? Zelda thought back to what Shesan said just earlier. “What is it you want?” She winced. “Sorry, that came out more blunt than I was intending.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia raised her chin and crossed her arms. A long pause made Zelda feel distinctly uncomfortable under her gaze. “As before, I seek to avert calamity,” the Fae said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was promising, if vague. “So… what can you tell me about the enemy?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia turned again to Shesan. Shesan crossed her arms and shook her head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It would not be wise for us to speak of this here and now,” Lucia said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed Shesan warily. <i>Why not?</i> “Then when? Where?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Soon,” they both said in unison. “When you have bonded the fragments,” Lucia added. “I will reveal everything about this and more to you. Soon.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay. That sounded like a firm commitment. She was okay with that. It was only a couple days away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about Ganondorf? Or Ja’bu? Can you talk about them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A strange calm settled over her just then. Peaceful. Tranquil. And something was tugging at her awareness. A light at the center of—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Best not speak that name here,” Shesan said. “I can’t protect you if you dive too deep.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started and blinked. Dive too… deep?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do not know more than Shesan does on these topics,” Lucia said, drawing Zelda’s attention away. “This may come as a surprise, but I know little of your world, save for the relatively short window of time from my birth to… the events immediately thereafter.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You were imprisoned with the other Fae, then?” Zelda asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia did not answer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sorry. Is that something you’d rather not discuss?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot speak to this,” Lucia said after a moment. “But the circumstances of my ‘imprisonment’ were… different.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said, feeling even more confused. Too many threads, all vying for her attention. It was so hard to pick just one. “What about other Void Entities? Can you—or are you willing—to tell me anything about them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They are legion,” Lucia said. “Multitudes beyond counting.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The landscape darkened as she spoke, until they were surrounded by an inky blackness that wasn’t quite night. Zelda gazed out into that unnatural darkness and noticed that it flowed over itself, pooling in some areas and leaving even darker voids behind. Those voids rhythmically collapsed and reopened… in a manner not unlike… blinking eyes…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gasped and jumped in fright as she realized she was being observed. The inky blackness faded, and they were again left in the dull-grey featureless landscape.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They are many, and varied,” Lucia said. “Trust me when I tell you that you do not wish to contact them or in any way draw their attention. Further, should you or your friends ever find the name of one written down someplace: <i>Do not</i> speak it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda gulped and wiped a bead of cold sweat from her brow. “Noted. So, uh… without referring to any specifically, are you… aware of any other hostile entities that might have a presence here? —In my world, I mean.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am not,” Lucia said after a brief pause.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda breathed a sigh of relief. One of her worst fears was that yet another entity like Ja’bu or Morudo Geira lay dormant somewhere in the Gorons’ territory. She wasn’t sure Hyrule could survive another cataclysmic reawakening of a long-thought-dead ancient evil.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What about non-hostile ones? Do those exist?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The landscape shifted again, this time brightening until they were surrounded by billowing clouds of white light. Three beings of radiant energy swam and flew through the clouds: A fearsome kraken, a mighty dragon, and a powerful serpent. Zelda watched on in awe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Lanayru, Eldin, and Faron,” Lucia said, giving a name to the shapes. “Guardian Spirits, tasked to protect the realm from intrusion in Hylia’s absence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The lights faded and the clouds retreated until they were once again left in the midst of mundane emptiness. Zelda felt a sense of longing as the light-entities retreated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If they have not yet intervened,” Lucia said, “then they are either slumbering and unaware of the threats, are engaged in struggles elsewhere… or are dead or otherwise incapacitated.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wow…” was all Zelda could say. “How do we… is there a way to contact them?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia met her eyes. There was sadness and mourning in them. She shook her head. “I fear I am of no help here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” Zelda said. Even if not, that gave her a glimmer of hope. Somewhere out there, there <i>were</i> entities who could help. Maybe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She remembered just then the shimmering barrier from Shesan’s vision, and the mural Link described from the Obsidian Spire. “Could the Golden Goddesses—or what remains of their influence—still be present in the world in a way that could be used to our advantage?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is the Triforce, and the Great Barrier,” Lucia said. “Beyond this, I cannot give you an answer that you would understand or find satisfying. Not without great danger to you, anyway.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned. “Another ‘more fragments’ thing?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…You may need the entirety of Wisdom for this one.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded, feeling somewhat unsettled at that. “Okay. And what about this ‘Great Barrier?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You have seen it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, I mean—what is it?” Zelda amended. “And is it connected in any way to those Guardian Spirits?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is not,” Lucia said. “It is however all that protects this world, and many others, from the Void.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s mind flashed back to the vision Shesan showed her in the desert. The writhing mass of dark flames and living shadow. The serpent coiled around the firmament, and the radiant fire it cradled within its scaly mass. The wonderful, terrible, beautiful, awesome spark that threatened to consume her, to burn away everything and all. It was the rising, triumphant thunder of a thousand horns heralding the coming of a hero, and the sad, mournful—</span>
<br><br>
<span>She snapped to as Shesan grabbed her and shook her by the shoulders. The woman raised a pointed eyebrow. “Careful. Not here. Understand?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But… No, I don’t understand. What about—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What I showed you before was carefully prepared,” Shesan said. “<i>Do not</i> draw its attention here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt the blood drain away from her face as she nodded. “Yeah. Got it.” She glanced about. Again, that unsettling feeling. It was so easy to get lost in one’s thoughts here. And not just metaphorically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was that part of what made Fae so dangerous? It didn’t seem to bother Lucia. Or Shesan, for that matter. Zelda touched a finger to her chin. “Forgive me, but I have to ask. How are you so different from other Fae? Like Cyrae?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>What do you know of Cyrae?</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda started. That was phrased as a question, but was <i>felt</i> as a command to speak.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You don’t have to answer that,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned to face her. “Should I not?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She shrugged. “Up to you. No harm either way. Just letting you know—you are not <i>compelled</i> to answer.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Forgive me,” Lucia said, more gently this time. “Old habits.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhm… okay,” Zelda said meekly. Was she implying something there? “To answer your question: I don’t know much. Just more stories Vestele told me. I suppose Arminel’s Conquest was after your time?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia frowned, then nodded. “To answer your question: When we Fae use our powers… our power over the hearts and minds and essence of mortal beings… we tend to lose pieces of ourselves. No matter our initial aims… over time, we become something different than what we once were. And so, despite our origins, we are in this manner susceptible to corruption by the forces of evil. To answer your next question: I am yet a young Fae, and I have taken great care not to use my powers any more than absolutely necessary. And to answer the unasked question: Yes, that demonstration was both intentional, and necessary.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Wow.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda’s mind spun as she grappled with the implications. Is that what Shesan meant earlier, about what Lucia “hadn’t done?” She felt her attention drawn to the dangling chains around the Fae’s wrists, and the full weight of what those superficial shackles symbolized came crashing down on her all at once. She could feel the full force of Lucia’s presence lying dormant just beneath the surface, like the winds of a raging tempest as she stood in the eye of the storm. In that moment she knew for certain she was little more than an insect next to this being, and yet the Fae still chose to speak and treat with her as an equal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vertigo.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda raised a hand to her head and stumbled as Shesan reached out to steady her. She felt a sense of awe, wonder, and terror at Lucia’s restraint. Could she do the same, if the roles were reversed? Likely not.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something else clicked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is this why Niesis imprisoned herself and the other Fae?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I cannot say,” Lucia said. “But from a certain perspective, that would not be an unreasonable course of action.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was that because she didn’t want to discuss it further, or because it was after her time? And how much of this did Vestele, the Sages, and the Seekers know?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda felt another weight pressing in on her—this one sharper, more threatening. Her mouth felt dry, and she licked her lips. “Are you my ally?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes,” Lucia said without reservation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And does this mean… that one day you will become my enemy?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I would sooner die than allow that to come to pass,” the Fae answered. She turned to peer up at the nothing with a hand on her chin. “Though I suppose that process is like death, in a way.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda swallowed, pushing down her fear and taking a calming breath. The evasion was not lost on her, though she appreciated that Lucia chose to be so transparent. “Vestele seemed to believe that you require Void Power to sustain yourself,” she said, connecting more dots. “—Not that she phrased it in those terms, exactly. Is that true?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is,” Lucia confirmed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So if you were to run out—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—I would die, yes. And… at least for now… I would prefer that to the alternative. But to answer your next question: One does not expect stories of Fae who quietly wither away into oblivion to survive the ages.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said. “So if I could provide you with Void Power instead… to sustain you without you needing to use your powers… without needing to feed on anyone’s essence…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I doubt we will reach that point,” Lucia said. “But if we do, I will keep your offer in mind.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t intend any offense,” Zelda said, “but that wasn’t a confirmation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You didn’t ask a question requiring a confirmation,” Shesan said. “Actually, I’m not sure that even counted as a question.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda eyed her curiously. Was she seriously implying—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know what you’re thinking,” Shesan said, arms crossed. “And I advise against it. She can’t lie to you, but she can evade and misdirect. And if you ask her any question thrice, she’s forced to give you a direct answer. But that does not mean she will <i>allow</i> you to ask, nor does it mean you have the fortitude to weather the storm. So to speak.” She glanced towards Lucia and rubbed her nose, then turned back to Zelda. “I fully expect this to fall on deaf ears, but—you really should not trifle with things you don’t understand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah,” Zelda gibed. “Speaking from experience, are we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan didn’t respond.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Curious. Zelda raised an eyebrow. “…Are you speaking from experience?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’m not a Fae, Zelda.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay. But are you speaking from experience?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Unbelievable,</i>” Shesan muttered. “You just can’t help yourself, can you? And yes, for what it’s worth, I am speaking from experience.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A very loud and very paranoid voice in the back of Zelda’s mind refused to let her ignore the fact that Shesan had just given her a direct answer after being asked thrice. “Okay,” she said simply, deciding to file every bit of that mess away for later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She turned back to Lucia. One thing in particular was bugging her, and she had to ask. “I can’t help but notice some parallels,” she said. “You know about Fi, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do,” the Fae answered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Come to think of it, could Fi manifest here? Zelda considered trying to call her, but didn’t want to risk it without checking with Shesan first, just in case.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Are you in any way similar to her?” she asked, refocusing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That is a very broad question,” Lucia said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fair,” Zelda responded, considering how to better phrase it. “Alright, allow me to rephrase: Do you see Fi as being an entity that is substantially similar to you in any important ways?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I do not.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda frowned. “Still—I can’t help but note that some of the things she can do—compelling sentient beings, for instance—seems very similar to the powers you claim to have. To the powers we’ve observed you exercising, even. That was you, back at the haunted pass, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia nodded. “Yes, of course.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She paused to muse on a passing thought. “What happened to Urik, by the way?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia did not answer, and Zelda felt a cold chill creep up her spine. She shook her head, deciding not to press. “Anyway—are you willing to tell me anything about these similarities? Can Fi learn from you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am not willing to use my powers in any capacity, except when it is absolutely necessary,” Lucia said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda paused, then turned about, gesturing with upturned palms. “Then what about this?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This is… different,” Lucia said. “To give a simple and somewhat misleading, but not entirely wrong answer, I am leveraging Shesan’s powers to speak with you here and now. Not my own.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And Ryn?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“On precisely two occasions I exercised influence over Ryn using my own power, focused through the pendant she wore. She remains unharmed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I see,” Zelda said. “Thank you for that,” she added.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course,” Lucia said with a smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda pondered on all the Fae had just said. Yet again, these answers only raised more questions. “So how does that work? And is it related to the tale of Moraga and her Pendant of Amethyst Sands?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia was silent for a long moment. Just when Zelda was beginning to think it best to drop the subject and move on, she answered. “I can’t say I know to whom or what you refer, but that seems to me like a story based in truth. Gems such as these serve as a focus for our power. A trick we Fae use to preserve ourselves as long as possible and make the most of our magic. And before you ask: they are of no use to you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Interesting. So did that mean… the scepter back at the Temple of Time, with the chromatic opal…?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I believe I have encountered another such item,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Shesan has informed me of this,” Lucia said before she could finish. “And yes, that sounds very much like a focus.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded along. “Should we work on getting you a new focus?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Lucia smiled warmly. “I appreciate the offer. If you can retrieve the pendant, that would be ideal. Otherwise, it will take me some time to make a new one. And for, I hope, obvious reasons, I would prefer not to do that.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah—that may prove difficult,” Zelda said with a nervous laugh. She turned to Shesan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’re still working on it,” Shesan said. “We’re going to have to turn it over to the Seekers. It may have been possible to replace it with a fake… but that’s a tall order on such short notice. And it would not behoove us to do anything that might arouse suspicion.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mm,” Zelda said. “And I suppose asking to have the pendant returned to us rather than allowing them to store it in the vaults—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—That would arouse suspicion, yes.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a pained sigh. Why did this have to be so difficult? “Alright,” she said, turning back to Lucia. “We’ll see what we can do.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You have my gratitude,” the Fae said with a nod.</span>
<br><br>
<span>What else? Zelda shook her head and blinked hard. She continued having trouble focusing. Every time there was a lull in the conversation, it felt like her thoughts were all competing to see which could force their way out first.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, before I forget—” she said, not wanting an important one to slip by, “Speaking of Fi. She sometimes communicates in a language we don’t understand. I don’t suppose you know what that is? Or, might you be able to translate for us?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan immediately cut in. “Zelda, Fi isn’t speaking another language. She’s using words for advanced technology and concepts you have no reference for, yet trying to explain them to you anyway in a manner she—as a construct—is unsuited for. If I tried to explain ꡃꡨꡔ꡷ꡩⰡꡌ ꡢꡘꡖꡙꡱꡔꡙ to you, you similarly wouldn’t understand. Those words might as well be nonsense.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda scrunched up her face. “New-clear… what?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Exactly,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda let out a groan of frustration. “Why can’t you explain them? I’m not an idiot.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Far from it,” Shesan said, to Zelda’s surprise. “Would you believe me if I told you that I’m prohibited by oath?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Maybe,” Zelda said guardedly. “Are you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Something like that, yes,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. Okay. That would explain a few things.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda jumped as she felt just as much as she heard a knocking sound echoing from everywhere at once. The featureless landscape and Lucia with it flew away at incredible speed, and a heartbeat later she landed with an uncomfortable jolt back in her chair in her study.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda? The retinue’s ready to depart.” Laylith, speaking through the cracked-open door.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda rubbed her eyes, adjusting to the light and taking a moment to get her bearings. That jump was one of the most disorienting things she had ever experienced, and as a well-practiced Blue mage, that was saying something.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… right,” she said, looking back over her shoulder. “How much time do we have?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We’ll need to leave within the hour if we’re going to make it to the docks before dusk.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned back around to look at Shesan.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you Laylith. We’ll be just a moment longer,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes. What she said,” Zelda echoed lamely.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Laylith appeared for a moment as if she might object, but then nodded and left. Zelda waited for the door to close before turning back around.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You have more questions for her,” Shesan said, stating the obvious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh, yeah. Can you blame me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan ran her thumb and forefinger over her brows. “I understand. Listen, Zelda: you should know that we’re working on something big. A plan, and a good one. I can’t say more right now—let’s just say it would be more effective to demonstrate it firsthand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda crossed her arms. She didn’t like the sound of that, but she supposed it was a step up from what she was used to. “Okay. And when can I expect this demonstration?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Soon,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“When I have the other fragments?” she ventured.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan hesitated.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress, I believe Shesan is intentionally withholding important information from you.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>No shit, Fi. Zelda pursed her lips.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan seemed to pick up on her displeasure. “Lucia expects a significant change to your <i>spiritual essence</i>,” she said, giving unusual weight to the words. “After you’ve bonded with the fifth and sixth fragments.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That doesn’t answer my question,” Zelda said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, it doesn’t,” Shesan said. “But please believe me—I am trying to explain.” She sighed as she ran her fingers through her short hair. “It’s… difficult. I don’t think you quite understand the magnitude of the powers you’re dealing with. One does not wield the power of gods without being fundamentally <i>altered</i> by the process. The fact that you bond so strongly to Wisdom suggests you resonate well enough with the ideal that you won’t be destroyed by it—which, given everything I know, appears to be by design. Still, you likely aren’t in for a good time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda slowly nodded along. “I see. And what does this have to do with your plan?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Our plan,” Shesan corrected. “And really, it’s more Lucia’s than anything.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She wasn’t yet sure if that made it better or worse.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The same changes… that will allow you more clarity into the nature of your dreams,” Shesan continued, with long pauses mid-thought, “…will also allow Lucia to communicate… <i>concepts</i> to you… more directly. And safely. Safe enough, anyway. At least, that’s her thinking. Do you understand?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think so?” Zelda said. She wasn’t sure. “What are your thoughts?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Shesan nodded emphatically. “It makes sense, and it’s concordant with my understanding of how these things work.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda stood and paced as she digested the information and considered. Her thoughts kept going to the intensity of her experiences during the conversation. That was what Shesan was referring to, right? That phenomenon, her experience of it, and everything surrounding it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>She stopped and pivoted. “So—and please correct me if I’m wrong—you’re saying that bonding with the fragments will fundamentally alter my essence in a way that will allow Lucia to more effectively communicate… <i>concepts</i>… to me, without me being overwhelmed by and getting lost in the experience?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, exactly!” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And this is necessary for her demonstration?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A pause. “I’m not certain, but it does seem to be an important part of the plan. You’ll have to ask her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay…” Zelda said. “And when can we speak like that again?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As soon as we get back?” Shesan said with a shrug. “Or sooner, if you could arrange for us to have uninterrupted privacy, and if I have guarantees to my standards that we aren’t being spied upon.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what would that entail?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Probably faster to just hurry back,” Shesan said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” Zelda repeated, feeling resigned. “Alright,” she said with a sense of finality. “We should get going, then.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Shesan said with a smirk as she stood and gestured towards the doors. “After you, <i>Your Grace.”</i></span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Think we’ll find more gadgets like this?” Izu asked, turning the transfabrulator over in his hands as he and Link ascended a small hill. Gods, it felt nice being able to walk without needing a cane.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “It’s a possibility. I mean—I don’t think we can count on it, but I hope so.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu slowly nodded as he examined the device. He could just imagine how the fight with the Warlord would have gone if he had access to it then. Hell, it was hard to imagine what an elite team fitted with ancient weapons as powerful as this would be capable of. If they could find a few more like it… Well, there probably wasn’t anything that would let him ‘rest easy at night,’ but for damn sure it’d be a good start.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright, let’s start from the basics,” he said as they crested the hill. “Tell me everything you know about how it works. As well as anything you’ve learned from using it yourself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link’s eyes lit up. His enthusiasm for everything tactics was something else. “By far the most important thing is that the blocks it creates are nearly indestructible,” he said. “Outstanding for on-demand defensive cover. Unmatched, really.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“‘Nearly’ indestructible?” Izu asked skeptically.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s what Fi said in her translation. From the text we found in the last temple.” He waved his hand. “I think that’s just her insisting on being technically correct. Nothing’s <i>actually</i> indestructible. But I used it in the upper levels of the Spire, and it withstood energy blasts from those weird worm-monster things. We’ve also tested it—by smashing the blocks into things, smashing things into them, smashing them into each other, hitting them with overcharged fireballs… Doesn’t matter. Doesn’t do anything to them. Not even a scratch.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded along. “Okay. Great, yeah. That’s good to know.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link leaned over and pointed towards the top of the device. “See these switches? There’s two near the thumb. The top one changes which kind of shape it makes—one for each regular solid. And the bottom one switches which mode it’s in. Left for ‘projection’ and right for ‘translocation’. Creating shapes and then launching them.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu examined the etchings again. He had been curious about that. The top switch had a circle, a triangle, a square, two triangles joined together, a pentagon, and a hexagon. “So… spheres, cubes… I forget the names of the others, but four sides, eight sides, twelve sides, and twenty sides? Like dice?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah, yeah,” Link said with a laugh. “I guess so? But the sphere doesn’t really count.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm.” Izu scratched his chin with his free hand and flipped the top switch to the circle. “How do I create one again? Just flip the bottom switch to the left?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, just like that,” Link said. “Then point it in front of you and squeeze. Harder for further away and more gently for nearby.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu held it at arms length and squeezed gently. A translucent cube appeared a few feet away. When he relaxed his grip, it shifted towards him, and when he tightened it, it sped away. “Huh. Surprisingly intuitive,” he remarked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep,” Link echoed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So how do I make it stick?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just squeeze it again quickly,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu did so, and a solid green cube materialized from nothing right in front of him with a <i>thump</i> as it hit the ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just as he suspected. “See this?” He pointed to the opposite sides of the sphere. It was pulsing lighter on one half and darker on the other.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So,” Izu said, “it’s kind of like a two-sided die. Yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah, yeah,” Link said with a big smile as he rubbed his neck. “I guess you’re right. Weird.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Speaking of pulsing,” Izu said, noticing the frequency speed up slightly as they spoke, “that’s a timer, right? How long does it last?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh yeah, it’s pretty useful,” Link said. “You can have a single block active for thirty seconds before it has to recharge, and each time you launch it, it drains about ten seconds. Two blocks: fifteen seconds, and three blocks: ten seconds.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And once the time runs out, all the blocks disappear?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm,” Link said. “But if you want to end it early, just tap the front face with your hand.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu did so. <i>Fuzz.</i> The sphere disappeared in a shower of green sparks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The only frustrating thing is that it takes a while to recharge—exactly fifteen seconds from empty,” Link said. “There’s an indicator on the front face if you look.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sure enough, on the front flat face of the device were glowing runes that spread slowly to cover the surface. “Wow,” was all Izu could think to say. The sophistication of this ancient technology was incredible. “So three blocks total, huh?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, but so far no one’s had a use for three blocks at once,” Link said. “If you have two out though, you can launch one offensively and use the other for cover. I did that in my fight with the worm-monsters in the Spire. Really useful—you just have to keep in mind the limited duration.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded as he digested the information. “And if I have multiple blocks out, how do I choose which one gets launched?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Erm…” Link scratched his head. “Good question. Uhh… by default it’s the last one created. I usually just use that, but… hrm… What was it she—oh, right.” He grinned as he set both hands atop his head. “Point and long-squeeze. It’ll vibrate, and whichever one is active pulses with the transfabrulator to let you know for sure.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu nodded again, feeling continually impressed. They really thought of everything. Experimentally, he flipped the top switch to the square, then created two cubes. He then flipped the bottom switch and pointed at the first block and did as instructed. The device buzzed in his hand as the visual pulsing swapped back to the first cube.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“See? Easy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll say.” Izu flipped the bottom switch, then pointed into the distance and squeezed. <i>Vorp! Fuzz.</i> The cube flew off at incredible speed and exploded in a shower of sparks.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh yeah,” Link said. “Something else to keep in mind—if a block ever goes out of range it fuzzes away like that. Same thing if you walk too far.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu grunted in acknowledgement and tapped the front face to dispel the other block. The second cube fuzzed and dematerialized. As expected, the runes on the device indicated it had about a third of its power remaining.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Useful. Very useful,” he idly remarked, rubbing his chin. “But like you say, the limited charge really restricts its tactical potential. I’m sure you’ve thought about it, but is there any way to increase that, or otherwise separate the defensive and offensive capabilities?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, no,” Link said right away. “Fi has no idea how it works, and said that any attempts to tinker with it are just as likely to break it. And seeing as we don’t have any spare transfabrulators lying around…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Got it,” Izu said. He shielded his eyes and squinted, trying to judge how far the block had flown. “Have you tested what the range is?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Link said. “Twelve meters for projection, and twenty-four for translocation. It doesn’t fly <i>quite</i> as fast as an arrow—we tested that too. But it’s still pretty fast. If you know it’s coming and you’re at max range, you could probably dodge it. Especially with magic. Doesn’t matter what kind—Foretelling, Invigorate, or Luck. Probably in that order of usefulness.” He frowned, visibly pondering something unpleasant. “Even more useful would be my fragments, now that I think about it. I haven’t tried that though, and I’m not keen to. It pretty reliably turns anything it hits into pulp.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Understandable,” Izu said. His own assessment—though he had far less experience with the device—was substantially the same. Conclusion: while it was an immensely useful tool, it would not be wise to rely too heavily on it. Not for offensive applications, anyway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Although… there were only so many countermeasures for insane, overwhelming brute force. Izu created another cube and launched it into a nearby tree. <i>Vorp!</i> <b>Crash!</b> The base exploded into splinters and the trunk came crashing down to their left.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mother Above—I’ll never get tired of doing that,” he said with a grin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s fun, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hell yes,” Izu said. “Can’t wait to see it in action.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He flipped it over in his hand, considering. Only one other question came to mind. “Have you found any of the shapes to be more useful than others? Other than the obvious—spheres roll, cubes don’t.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not really, no,” Link said. “To pick nits, I’d guess the more arrowhead-shaped ones would fly slightly faster and be more effective at penetrating armor, but the blocks are heavy enough that practically, it doesn’t matter. For defense, the cube offers slightly better cover, but the icosahedron is probably best for deflecting projectiles. The sphere would be best, except that it might roll back on top of you if hit hard enough, which isn’t exactly ideal. Besides that…?” He shrugged and shook his head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Icosahedron… that’s the twenty sided one?” Izu asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah,” Link said. “And tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron are the others. Four, eight, twelve.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right, yeah. Thanks,” Izu said with a grimace. “It’s been a while since I had any schooling.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh. Don’t feel bad,” Link said. “I wouldn’t know either except for Fi.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmm.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They both gazed off into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, I guess I’ll leave you to it?” Link said after a moment.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, sure. Might as well get some more practice in.” Izu said. Not like there was anything better to do, and he had already napped enough for two people today. “Thanks for the pointers.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Of course!” Link said cheerfully. “Anytime. Just let me know if you have more questions.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Will do.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Link knelt next to Kellin as they inspected a ruined column of stone. There was a recess on one side that had been the home of a spiny hoarder beetle—until they disturbed it by clearing away the obscuring moss and vines, anyway.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“A hearth maybe?” Kellin suggested. “Or a forge?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, maybe,” Link said, considering. “How long do you think this has been here?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin shrugged. “Who knows?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm—oh, actually, Zelda might,” Link said as the idea came to him. “Fi, can you ask her?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes, Master,</i> came the acknowledgement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She’s asking,” he relayed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin nodded, and the pair spread out to investigate.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It seemed to be a dwelling of some sort? Or maybe a workshop. There was an intact archway of hewn stone several paces away, and the rough outline of a circular wall forming a perimeter, though the vast majority of the structure had long since been reclaimed by nature.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were still about half a day’s travel from the temple when Ryn had spotted this place while scrying from camp. Link decided to check it out of the off chance there was anything interesting laying about. If nothing else, it was an excuse to burn away some of his restless energy. He had been feeling increasingly agitated the closer they came to their destination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm, maybe a better view would help?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He eyed the stone column and circled around it. It seemed sturdy enough. He gave it an experimental push, gently and then again more forcefully. It took all of his weight without budging and then some. Yep, sturdy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He backed away a couple paces, then got a running start and clambered atop the tapered ruin, steadying himself with one hand wrapped around the column as he surveyed the area.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The growth here was considerably less dense than the surrounding forest. No big trees. Lots of underbrush. Saplings, and waist high bushes in a few places. Was it a natural glade? Or perhaps it had been used as farmland.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Zelda is uncertain, Master,</i> Fi said, her voice echoing in his mind. <i>She suggested a range of a few hundred years to ‘thousands,’ dating to before the fall of the Old Kingdom.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hrm… thanks Fi,” Link murmured, rubbing his chin with his free hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What did she say?” Kellin asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She doesn’t know,” Link said, relaying the information as he hopped back down. “A few hundred years—maybe thousands? Though if it’s as old as the temples, it’s likely on the longer side, yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“They could be from multiple time periods,” Kellin suggested. “Have you considered that?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link gave her a curious look. “Yeah, I suppose so.” His thoughts went to the ruins at the Haunted Pass. Those were definitely more recent than the Lightsworn training facility. It very well could be the same deal here.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Kellin shrugged and turned to sift through a pile of rubble. Link paced away, letting his mind wander as he circled the perimeter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It bothered him that they didn’t know for sure. It wasn’t something he thought about often, but he wished that they knew more about history and the people who had come before. Someone had lived or worked here. Had there been a settlement nearby, and did they know anything about the temple? When was the last time anyone visited it?</span>
<br><br>
<span>As the Faith taught, it was the destruction wrought by centuries of war, infighting, and Blights that had left them culturally bereft and ignorant of ancient knowledge. It wasn’t until they returned to the old ways that the kingdom began to thrive again, rather than sliding further into darkness and ignorance. What little they did retain was carefully guarded and maintained by the Order of Sages to preserve it through the ages.</span>
<br><br>
<span>And it was times like these that Link really comisserated with Zelda’s frustration at the inadequacy of those records.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A grunt from Kellin. Link turned sharply and headed back over. “Find anything?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” she said, brushing soil off her hands. “Just rocks, dirt. Some bugs.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wait, something felt off. Link frowned, then retraced his steps. He drew his sword and used it to part the underbrush, revealing a cobblestone path.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. Neat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think I found something?” he called out.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh yeah?” Kellin asked as she ambled over.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Looks like a pathway.” He followed it a few paces. It curved around a knoll, then went down a slight incline towards the treeline. It was plainly visible there, without the brush to obscure it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He looked back over his shoulder questioningly. He kind of wanted to see where it led.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure,” Kellin said. “Right behind you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grinned and nodded, donning his shield just in case. “Careful. There could be anything in these woods.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep,” Kellin affirmed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Goddesses, it felt like it had been <i>ages</i> since he got to do this—scouting the wilderness, not knowing what they’d find. Link felt alive and in his element as they ventured into the unknown, alert for possible threats. He—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Came to a halt as the path abruptly ended at a cliff. He frowned, then strolled up and peered over the edge. There was a clearing below. About five meters down? A steep slope, but not too steep. He could probably climb down it without issue, but getting back up would be more difficult.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey. See that over there?” Kellin raised a finger and pointed, directing his attention.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link followed her gaze. A thin stone pillar stood in the distance. A marker, maybe? It seemed to have etchings, but it was difficult to make them out at this distance. “I don’t suppose you brought a spyglass?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah. Didn’t think to,” Kellin said. “Hold on, one second.” She sat down and got comfortable, then her head jerked back as she scried into the distance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link waited patiently. It wouldn’t take long. She—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“CAWW!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oww! What the—” Link swatted at a giant red-plumed bird that dove in from nowhere, its talons scratching harshly against his collarbone. It flapped its wings in his face and knocked him off balance as it took off again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What is it?!” Kellin said as she wobbled back up and shook her head, blinking hard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ugh, nothing,” Link said, dusting himself off. “Just a… takkuri, I think they’re called. It, uh…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>With rising dread, he realized what it held in its talons. “<i>My necklace!</i>”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Without a second thought, he drew his bow and nocked an—<i>fick!</i> His arrows had all been knocked from his quiver in the scuffle. He bent down to grab one as Kellin let loose a spray of ice shards in its general direction. Link knelt and readied his shot, but he had already lost sight of the damned thing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you get it?” he asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I don’t think so,” Kellin said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick! This was <i>not</i> happening! He gathered up a handful of arrows and stuffed them back into his quiver.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What should we—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Get the others!” Link shouted as he dove over the edge of the cliff and slid down its slope. “Fi, show me where it went!”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>This way, Master,</i> Fi communicated telepathically as swirling chromatic vapor drifted in from the aether.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Link!” Kellin called from atop the cliff. “I can’t just—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Go! Now!” he commanded, calling out over his shoulder as he followed Fi’s avatar into the forest. This was beyond stupid, but if he didn’t act now, there was little chance they’d ever see the fragments again. “I’ll be fine, just go!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, on it!” Kellin replied, her voice already distant.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link thanked the Goddesses for his blessing from the temple. He tore through the woods at a dead sprint, putting blind faith in Fi to guide him as he ducked under branches, weaved through foliage, and hopped over roots and rocks. The takkuri had the advantage in the air, but those large birds couldn’t fly that fast. In less than a minute he caught sight of it again through the sparse tree cover. And he was closing the distance, fast.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They broke through the trees into a clearing, and neared another cliff. Link skidded to a halt. This was it. He had to take the shot. He took several deep breaths in quick succession as he drew an arrow, then breathed out to steady himself. He lined it up, judged the wind speed, distance, drop… gave it a good lead, and…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Bullseye. The bird let out a <i>squawk!</i> as the arrow struck true and it fell from the sky.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…Two feet over the edge of the cliff.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick!</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Dizzy.</i> Link felt light-headed and began to tunnel vision. He doubled over and took a moment to catch his breath before darting to the edge to see where it went.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link cursed his luck. It just kept getting worse. Down about a fifteen meter drop was a river, and the takkuri’s carcass had already begun floating downstream.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi,” he said, struggling between breaths. “How deep is it? Is it safe to dive?” He preemptively dropped his equipment, kicked off his boots, undid his belt, and doffed his mail tunic.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Calculating,” Fi said, her hues shifting as she floated over the edge. “The river is approximately eight meters deep. With proper form, I estimate a negligible probability—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He couldn’t wait for her to finish. With a running start, Link leapt over the cliff, pinching his nose and keeping his legs stiff beneath him to break the surface of the water.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Rushing wind, then came the splash. It stung like hell. Cold. Ice cold. He swam back up to the surface, gasping for breath as he turned to locate the carcass. Fi helpfully got his attention and directed him towards it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had never been the greatest swimmer, but he swam like his life depended on it. Like the fate of the world depended on it—because it absolutely ficking did. Fortunately the current wasn’t that swift, and he caught up before being carried too far downstream.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even in death, the greedy asshole’s talon’s were still clutched around his necklace. He had trouble wresting it free while treading water though, so opted to drag the corpse along the surface with him as he pedaled towards the shore. Once he could comfortably stand he wasted no time prying the chain loose, then unceremoniously tossed the takkuri’s carcass back into the stream.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Damned bird,” he muttered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The clasp was broken, so he securely hitched the chain around a loop on his trousers. It would do for now.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Brrr.</i> He shivered as the wind picked up, then plodded the few feet to shore and began wringing water out of his clothes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi?” he called out, not seeing where she went. “Can you contact Izu? Let everyone know where I am?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes, Master. I have already done so</i>, came the response. <i>I am guiding them to you as we speak.</i> </span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks. You’re amazing,” Link said with a chuckle, followed by a long sigh of relief.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wind picked up again and he shivered. It wasn’t that cold out, but he was exposed and wet. It wouldn’t take long for hypothermia to set in, and he didn’t want to chance it, even if the team was on their way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link searched down the shoreline for a piece of flint, then turned his attention to the brush further afield, collecting twigs, dead leaves, and a couple thicker branches. Getting a fire started without proper equipment was usually a pain, but—</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sound of a twig snapping sent his survival instincts into high alert. Link spun, dropping the kindling and wielding the largest branch he carried as a weapon against whatever manner of creature lurked in the forest ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Once again, he cursed his luck. Could the day get any worse? Two wolfos prowled towards him from the left. —Three. Another, straight ahead.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Fick. Link sized up his attackers as he backed away, careful not to make any sudden movements lest he trigger their predatory instincts to give chase. The two on the left were smaller than the other, which meant there was likely a fourth somewhere nearby hiding in wait—wolfos packs usually consisted of a mating pair and their cubs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Even without his equipment, he could probably take them in a fight if he had to. Still, he’d rather not risk it. No use tiring himself out and using up his reserves if it wasn’t absolutely necessary.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, how close are Izu and the others?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>About three minutes away, Master.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link groaned. That might as well be an eternity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They were closing in. Heading back into the river would be about the worst thing he could do—wolfos were excellent swimmers. But he also wasn’t about to get cornered, either. He strafed along the shore, heading upstream while waving his branch menacingly to keep them all in front of him. The closest one bluff charged him. He stood his ground and yelled to intimidate it. It backed off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An idea.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fi, can you compel them? Distract them, get them to fight each other—anything. Buy me some time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes, Master.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>One of the pair further away turned to growl and swipe at the other. The second barked and bit back, but instead of fighting they just turned their attention back to Link.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Damnation. Well, it was worth a shot.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He glanced around, careful not to take his eyes off any of them for more than a split second. To his chagrin, he spotted another pair creeping towards him from the shallows behind. Larger ones. Definitely not cubs.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Not good. Not good at all. He had never known wolfos to hunt in packs this big…</span>
<br><br>
<span>He considered bolting for the forest. If he was fast enough, he could climb up a tree, hopefully buying enough time for—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Okay, yet <i>another</i> pair were closing in from the treeline. Seven, total?! He cursed his thrice-damned luck, then said a prayer to the Goddesses. This was about to get messy.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link turned and ran, heading upstream and hopefully towards rescue. The wolfos pack yipped and howled in pursuit as they worked themselves into a frenzy. He did his best to avoid the sharper rocks, but without any footwear he tore holes in his feet as he ran. He couldn’t focus on that, though. He could get Healing later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He rounded a bend and was faced with a choice. Attempt to climb a rock pile to a hill above, or cut into the forest? He chose the latter. The wolfos were fast, but he was just as fast, if not faster. He could keep them going for a while, but one wrong slip, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nearly stumbled as he came to a halt. Three of the pack had gotten ahead of him and cut him off. The other four fanned out, boxing him in. He had no choice now but to climb. He—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I smell your fear, little Hylian,” came a gruff, hoarse voice from above. Link nearly jumped out of his skin as he whipped his head up to discern its source.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You disappoint me,” said a towering, grey-furred wolfos with tufts of white fur on its chest. It was covered in patchwork scars and had half of one ear chewed off.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Since when could wolfos talk?!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uh… hi?” Link tried. “I’m Link. Who are you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Names…” the wolfos said with a derisive snort. “You can name me… if you wish. What name… do you give your death?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link swallowed. Clearly he wasn’t about to reason with a bloodthirsty wolfos, even if it could talk. He glanced back around. The rest of the pack had spread out in a loose semicircle and were giving them plenty of space.</span>
<br><br>
<span>His mind went blank. Was this a dream? Never in a million years did he think he’d find himself in a situation like this.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was probably best to keep the… guy?… talking. The team had to be close by now. But his mind refused to work. What did one say to a wolfos?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fear… is a reflex…” it said. “But <i>Courage</i>… is a choice. Do you have the courage… to fight? Or will you die… a coward?” It let out a low, repetitive growling noise that Link interpreted as laughter. It was met with howling and yipping from the rest of the pack.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The alpha wolfos beat its chest, then spread its arms wide. Link noticed a shimmering golden bracer around its right wrist, emblazoned with a familiar shape. Did it… was it in possession of a fragment of Courage? That might explain a few things.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Uhh… I guess that depends?” Link said warily. “What do you consider a ‘fair fight?’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just you… and me, Hylian. To the death.” Again, that growling laughter. The alpha wolfos bounded down the rock pile, leaping and landing about a dozen paces ahead. Link instinctually brandished his… stick, and the wolfos raised its claws in challenge before digging into the ground, ready to charge.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Okay, here we go,</i> he thought to himself as he tossed the useless stick aside and raised his fists. He wasn’t eager to fight a wolfos this large—unarmored, with his bare hands, surrounded by its pack and massively outnumbered. But it wasn’t as if he had a choice in the matter, either.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Deep breath. He had gone toe-to-toe with Gazra, and that man was at least as threatening.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother Above,</i> Link prayed. <i>I know now it was your will that brought me here. I only ask for your guidance. Please, help me see this through.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>He stepped forward, and the alpha wolfos tore forward to meet him. Link’s magic ignited in his veins as he closed the distance, sidestepping a mighty bound and shoving into the wolfos from below while narrowly avoiding a swipe to the face.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The alpha wolfos landed hard, sprawling ungracefully. Link pivoted and pressed the advantage, attenuating his magic to avoid unnecessary burn until he closed. Just as he entered striking distance, he flared it again, and the world came to a near halt.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The wolfos scrambled to get its footing, then lashed out with a swipe. Link evaded and struck in, set to crush the beast’s throat… but missed by a hair as the alpha wolfos jumped back at the last moment. It looked at Link, fear plainly visible in its eyes, before howling and digging in to lunge again. Link rushed to meet it, and—</span>
<br><br>
<span>No, its balance was wrong—it was a feint. Link turned his foot and dug in to arrest his momentum, just in time to dodge a wild, overextended one-two slash that left the alpha wide open. Link shifted his weight onto his back foot and wound up, then drove an Invigorated fist into the side of its chest with all his might.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The alpha slammed into the ground and struggled, whimpering, unable to rise. Link prepared to deliver the coup de grâce, but it proved unnecessary. The beast spat up a mouthful of blood, then collapsed, motionless.</span>
<br><br>

    <div id="marker" style="position: absolute; top: 100px;"></div>
</div>
<div id="death-scene">
    <span><i>Fick,</i> that stung. He shook his hand as he examined the corpse, looking for—</span>
    <br><br>
    <span><i>—Urg!</i> Searing pain. Link arched and reflexively reached to cover his back. He spun to face his attacker, only to be tackled to the ground in a dogpile. He shrieked in agony as jaws clamped around his limbs and he was torn apart by claws and fangs.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>It was pure torture, being eaten alive. Not something he ever wanted to experience again as long as he lived.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>…He wasn't sure he would ever get used to this, no matter how many times it happened.</span>
    <br><br>
    <span>Link waited patiently—as patiently as he could given the circumstance—until he bled out and the darkness took him.</span>
    <div id="scene-end">
        <br><br>
    </div>
</div>
<div id="triforce-ex-machina" style="display: none;">
<span>Link stumbled as his consciousness floated back into his body after experiencing a particularly gruesome death.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mother Above! Why had he thought that was the end of it? No, of course the rest of the pack still wanted to fight. They had him outnumbered seven-to-one after all.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Scanning around, he found where they were thinnest. A single wolfos stood by itself near the shore as the others grouped up and closed. Link wasted no time going after it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He wasn’t sure what he was expecting. Where the alpha put up a real fight, this one just stood there as Link burned the rest of his reserves to cave its skull in before it could react.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With that one taken care of, Link whirled about. He was surrounded now with precious little room to maneuver, and he was completely out of magic. He'd need a miracle to survive this, and he had just used one up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He feinted, baiting an attack, and only narrowly missed having his arm chomped off by one of the cubs as he yanked it back. He sensed movement in his periphery and ducked just in time to avoid a grapple, then pivoted into an axe kick that snapped the neck of a fourth wolfos that left itself open.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>VORP!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The sweet, sweet sound of salvation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Too late, Link covered his face as he was splattered with a spray of blood, fur, and guts. Shards of razor ice and a blazing ball of fire rained down from above, followed by a rampaging Gazra leaping from the rock pile to land between him and what remained of the pack.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two wolfos that survived the initial volley—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>VORP!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>The singular wolfos that survived the encounter scampered, whining, back into the forest.</span>
