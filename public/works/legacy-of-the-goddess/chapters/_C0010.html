<span>“I’m just not getting it,” Link said from atop his oxgoat. Zelda rode alongside him at a comfortable distance. “What if I don’t have a Blue affinity? Or what if I have to ‘unlock’ it first, like I did with Red?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gah! Link—stop getting ahead of yourself,” she said, sounding irritated. “You might not, but that would be more surprising to me than the alternative, and we’ve only been trying for a few minutes. Most likely you’re just not doing it right. I had similar problems learning Red and Green when I was first taught. Now, if you would just <i>listen</i>…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He probably was being more difficult than he needed to be. He knew it was often hard to catch things like that until they were pointed out to you. But in his defense, he didn’t get much sleep last night, through no fault of his own.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He tried to relax and clear his mind.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright,” he said. “Go on. I’m listening.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She explained it again, changing up the words slightly. Hold the message in your mind. Draw on your affinity. Project. Link tried again, doing as instructed. He felt <i>something</i> stir inside him, but it wasn’t any different from the last few times he tried. He looked to Zelda expectantly. She shook her head. Link shrugged.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Same thing,” he said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm, okay,” she said, looking deep in thought. Link yawned and stretched as he waited for her to tell him what to do next.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So, if I had to guess,” she said, “you‘re either trying to draw on your Blue affinity as if were your Green, or you’re still only drawing on your Green affinity and trying to get it to do something it can’t. It’s hard to explain, but it <i>feels</i> different to draw on the different affinities. It’s like… you know how you hear sounds from your ears and see sights from your eyes? It’s next to impossible to describe what that difference <i>actually is</i>, but you would never mistake sight for sound. Well unless you eat this one kind of mushroom—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link grunted impatiently. “And how does this help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Patience</i>, please. I‘m getting there.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright. Sorry, go on.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As I was saying,” she continued, “I can’t know exactly what it feels like like for you to draw on your Green affinity, but it should be something like… pulling it up? Collecting it from around you? Drawing energy from your core?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, that,” Link said, nodding. “Drawing it up. That describes it pretty well.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Right. So for Green magics, you draw it up, focus it, and then send it out. That sound about right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Can you describe to me what using each of the Green magics feels like?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sure,” he said. “Like you said, first I draw up my magic and focus it. With Luck, it feels like… kind of like putting it into a shell around me? With Imbue, I just push it into the object I guess. Never really had to think about it. And I’m not that practiced with Healing or Soothe, but I remember them feeling very similar. I push the energy into the wounds, or send out pulses.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And what about Bursting? Have you practiced that any?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He shook his head. “Well, a little. I’ve seen some of the stuff more adept Green mages can do, and it’s pretty awesome. But I gave up on training that pretty early on when I realized arrows were more effective. For me, at least. I mean, my affinity was never that great to begin with.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mmhmm. And was this how it felt when you used Invigorate last night?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er, no,” Link said, scratching his head. “I hadn’t really considered that. But yeah you’re right. That felt different. It felt more like… being fueled by my magic? Energy igniting inside me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep, sounds about right.” Zelda indicated for him to wait; she looked to be mulling it over. Link took the opportunity to snag a drink from his waterskin.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, so Blue is going to feel very different to both of those,” she said. “For it, you have to <i>know</i> exactly what will happen as a result of you using the ability. You have to <i>expect</i> it to happen, to the extent that you proceed as if you <i>know for certain</i> that your magic will do what you want. What helped me was to think of it as ‘summoning.’ Does that make sense?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think so? Not sure,” Link said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay, watch,” Zelda said, hopping off her oxgoat and walking a few paces away from the caravan. Link followed her lead. “Keep going,” she called to someone, “we won’t fall far behind.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She pointed a few paces ahead, and Link watched as crystal rose sprung from the ground. A second later, it shattered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So that?” she said. “It didn’t feel like <i>making</i> an ice crystal. I imagined the exact shape of the ice in my mind, and thought of it as <i>already being there</i>. My magic didn’t <i>act</i> on the world to create the ice flower; it called that shape of ice into the world. In a word, I ‘summoned’ it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay,” he said, nodding pensively. “I think I get it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda motioned to the caravan, and they jogged back over to their oxgoats and caught up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So how do you think you can apply that to telepathy?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He had to think about it. This would be a lot easier if he had gotten more sleep. “Well, I guess I just need to <i>expect</i> you to hear the message when I send it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not quite,” she said. “But closer. You’re still thinking in terms of <i>doing</i> something. It isn’t that the message travels from you to me. More like… imagine that the words are already in your mind. They exist on their own, and you are just holding on to them right now as you consider their meaning. And then you draw on your affinity, and project those very same words and their meaning into my mind. Like with the ice flower. It was always <i>somewhere</i>. Hypothetically. I just called it here.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Hmm. Hold on to the message. Draw. Project.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Like this?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda squeed. <i>Yes, exactly like that!</i> came her response as her eyes flashed with a faint blue light. <i>See? It just took a little patience.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shuddered. The experience of hearing someone else’s voice in his mind was always a little unnerving. But damnation if that wasn’t useful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“So why isn’t this used more often?” he asked, feeling curious.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Mostly it just goes back to the same problem as always,” she said. “Magic is a limited resource. Judging by what I know of your reserves, you probably won’t be able to send more than a half-dozen short messages before exhausting yourself. And that’s if you <i>only</i> used Telepathy.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” he said, frowning. “Yeah, I suppose that makes sense. I just didn’t think it would take as much magic as things like Luck.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That was unfortunate. He was already looking forward to tactical applications like bombarding his opponent with misdirection or just a bunch of nonsense during a fight. Seems that wasn’t as practical as he had hoped. Though he knew in a group it was still viable…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Speaking of: you should definitely put more time into expanding your reserves now,” she said. “I know it might not have made much sense for you before, but your working assumptions have changed considerably.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh yeah, absolutely,” he said. “I’ll work that into my routine.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm…” Zelda said ponderously. “It also occurs to me that we don’t actually know your precise Blue or Red affinity, and your Green might have changed. We’ll need to get you properly tested when we get back.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah. For sure.” Why hadn’t he thought of that already? He supposed he was still getting used to having so many resources and talented people at his disposal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ready to move on to Scrying?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, not yet,” Link said. “I had a few questions first. If that’s okay?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, of course. No rush; we have plenty of time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>It took him a while to gather his thoughts. His mind was a little sluggish today, and he kept losing focus. There were a few loose ends he wanted to tie up though before moving on.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Do you know how many ‘short messages’ you can send?” he asked. “Just trying to get a more accurate idea of your reserves in terms of mine.” That was important to know, he reckoned, both so he could gauge his own limits and be more informed of hers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, uh. No, actually,” Zelda said, tapping at her chin. “But my Blue affinity is the strongest in the kingdom that I’m aware of. As a result, I don’t really consider the cost of Telepathy most of the time. —And, due to the nature of the ability, it would be difficult to get an exact measure. Imprecise at best. But if I had to guess? A few dozen.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He nodded. “And longer messages take more magic, right?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She waggled her hand. “It’s some mix of length and complexity,” she said. “As I said, difficult to gauge.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Makes sense.” He knew that messages were often encoded to reduce the size. There was the obvious reason that was done, but it also made sense to conserve as much magic as possible. Which… hmm.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait, so range doesn’t affect the cost? I know there are limits there, otherwise we wouldn’t need Scry-towers and such. How does that work?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Good question!” she said with a smile. “Obviously, you have to know where the person is you want to send the message to. Without knowing that, you can’t possibly reach them. It doesn’t take more magic to send messages further, but it does require a lot more practice to do so consistently. It’s just something you learn with time.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>But wouldn’t that mean… “So let’s say I were to use a telescope,” he said, following the obvious line of reasoning. “Would that extend my range?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh,” she said, waggling her hand again. “Somewhat. Not as much as you’d think, but yes it helps. What’s much more effective is to couple it with Scrying, which actually does increase the range significantly. I mean, that’s the whole principle behind the Scry-towers. It’s more about… hmm. You have to be able to visualize where the recipient is in relation to you spatially. And there isn’t much room for error. I suppose it’s more like lobbing a rock than shooting an arrow; you can’t just fire it off in their general direction. That make sense?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I think so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Like I said, you’ll get it with more practice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shrugged. “I think I’ll just have to trust you on that for now.” —Wait, what else was he going to ask? He rubbed his face, then took another swig of water.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, yeah. There’s something else that’s been bothering me,” he said, finally managing to recover the thread. “More of an… observation than a question, really. So even though each affinity <i>feels</i> different to use and <i>works</i> differently and <i>does different things</i>, they all draw from the same pool of reserves? I mean—I know that’s true, I just never considered before how weird it was.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yep!” Zelda chirped enthusiastically. “One of the great mysteries. The three colors of chromatic magic are all uniquely distinct, and yet somehow intricately linked together in a way that isn’t fully understood. Interesting, isn’t it? It almost certainly has to do with the nature of the Golden Three and their role in creating the world, but beyond that the theories diverge wildly. There’s been loads of writing on the subject. I’d be more than happy to go over any of it with you if you’re interested?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Heh,” he said, sensing an imminent and lengthy tangent of dubious importance. “No thanks. I think I’ll leave the philosophy to you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Hrmph!</i> Suit yourself,” she said with a laugh. “But yeah, I suppose that’s fair enough. Just don’t make me sit through any more lectures on battle reports. Deal?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, yeah, alright,” he said, trying and failing to suppress a chuckle. “—Oh, and one last thing before I forget. I meant to ask: what about Imbue and Bursting? I mean, it makes sense to have different tactical options, but I’m pretty sure the effects of Imbue don’t change depending on which type of magic you use. I can skip those for now, yeah?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, you’ll likely only want to actively work on those with your strongest affinity,” Zelda replied. “Until we know for certain what that is now, I would say don’t focus on them.” She huffed. “But you’re always thinking about combat potential, Link! You know, you don’t have to train your Bursting with other affinities to the point you can mow down small armies. You can do all sorts of other useful things with just a modicum of practice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I <i>suppose</i> you’re right,” he said begrudgingly. Though taking time to do so would still detract from his other training regimens. He’d have to see how much he could work in…</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Only another half-hour to Kakariko, but Link was already exhausted. On the bright side, they were making decent time and the sun was still up. At the very least, he should be able to get some decent sleep tonight after completing the first rounds of training.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mother’s Mercy</i>—Scrying was horrible. He had aches and bruises all over from where he repeatedly fell from the saddle trying to practice. He attempted to tie himself in place after the second attempt, but quickly learned the effect was infinitely worse when he didn’t have freedom of movement. It was just <i>so ridiculously hard</i>. He had no idea why anyone would willingly put themselves through that. It gave him one hell of a headache every time he tried, and the feeling of vertigo while the effect was active was so intense it made him vomit. Twice.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Needless to say, he wasn’t exactly keen on practicing it again anytime soon. It would probably take hundreds of hours of training before he could use it reliably. And even then, the practical applications of it just weren’t there. Surely he could just rely on Zelda and others when need be?</span>
<br><br>
<span>On the other hand, Foretelling was easy enough to get the hang of after Zelda’s explanation, especially once he got the feel of drawing on his Blue affinity. It still took the majority of his reserves each time (which Fi helpfully replenished as needed), but he figured out how to reliably call a coinflip in the air before it hit the ground. Well, most of the time. And he still couldn’t manage it <i>before</i> the coin was tossed, but even Zelda could only do that slightly better than chance. Zelda maintained that it was the least useful of all the known magics; mostly only used by mystics and soothsayers to pilfer money from the gullible.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Contrary to her opinion, however, he was given to understand that Foretelling was an important component in some advanced fighting styles employed by Sheikah and the like with strong Blue affinities. That sounded promising enough, though by all indications it would take a great deal of training before the additional information afforded by the ability proved to be more useful than distraction. Also, its use would compete with far more direct abilities, like Luck and Invigorate. Seeing as he had access to those, perhaps training to use Foretelling wasn’t the best idea.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He did wind up practicing more with Telepathy on his own, and found he could reliably send messages a few dozen meters, even when his target was obscured from sight. Further than that and he failed more often than not, but at least he understood what it was Zelda was talking about earlier. There was something about the process of <i>projecting</i>, and the need to make a successful connection with the target. Being able to clearly visualize the path to them helped. Knowing precisely where they were in relation to you made it second-nature. And if you had direct eye contact, it was a given.</span>
<br><br>
<span> He felt like he had a good handle on how to refine his skill there, and could probably do so on his own reliably, but he wasn’t sold on the merits. Quick, silent, and secure communication at short-to-medium range he could already do. And it seemed useful enough in a combat situation—assuming he could get his reserves up to the point that using it wouldn’t exhaust him—but he could refine that facet as a matter of course during regular training. The usefulness of long-distance communication, however, didn’t seem like it was worth the time investment. At least, not when there were plenty of others who already specialized in that niche.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To his relief, Koja didn’t have much to say to him, other than that his skill was “adequate.” She told him if he wanted to be a proficient healer that he’d need dedicated training. Training that she wouldn’t be able to provide on the road like this without collateral damage. Link didn’t press. She did however certify to Zelda that his proficiency in Luck was solid enough for the time being.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just a round of Red magic training with Grenja left, and he could rest. How bad could that be?</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Alright, ENOUGH TALK! Show me what you’ve got!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“What? But we’re not even—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“En garde!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Sparks of red, and a blur of movement. <i>Damnation</i> was he fast. But Link already had a handle on this. He had already done this before.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Where Green magic was <i>gathering</i> and <i>doing</i> and Blue magic was <i>seeing</i> and <i>projecting</i>, Red just was. He called, and his magic answered. It ignited inside him, drove him, provided him with the fuel needed to <i>move</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Time came to a crawl. Grenja flew at him, but Link matched him move for move. He sidestepped; once, twice, back and again, keeping distance, denying openings. He managed to evade a strike, but Grenja dug in, pivoted, and reached out to grapple. Link swung low and under his grasp, lining up a punch at his center of mass. But again, Grenja was a step ahead—he deflected the blow easily and spun with a kick in the same motion. Link, out of options, kicked back off the ground, anticipating—</span>
<br><br>
<span>But no—he got too much air with that last move. He was on a ballistic trajectory—couldn’t course correct. And Grenja didn’t let the opportunity go to waste. Link tried to turn, tried to cover himself, but it was no use. The man was there to intercept, and had him by the neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Yield!</i>” Link managed to gasp.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja released him, and helped him to his feet.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Spec. Ficking. Tacular,</i>” the man said. “Unbelievable! You’re a natural, kid.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks? But uh, you were so much faster than me,” Link said, confused. “I could barely keep up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well,” he said, flexing his biceps. “That’s because I’m stronger and faster than you unaugmented.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was he being serious right now? Link had to fight to keep his expression neutral.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s simple,” Grenja went on, “Invigorate increases your strength and agility. That’s all there is to it. You want to get more juice out of it? Work on building up your physique. But by my reckoning, you’re more than proficient already with the magic itself.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh,” was all Link could think to say. “So you don’t have anything else to teach me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nah,” he said. “If you really want to push it further, you’ll need someone with a different skillset than me. And let me tell you: there are whole artforms based around augmented fighting. Some real next level shit. Me? Never really had use for it. Why dance around when you can just smash in some skulls at the blink of an eye?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Grenja let out a hearty guffaw. Link chuckled uneasily. “Yeah, I guess?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But you?” He made an exaggerated frown, shaking his head minutely. He glanced over his shoulder, pointing back to Link’s sword, which he had demanded Link leave behind alongside his other equipment prior to the duel.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I heard you used that on the kodongo that almost sent Burdah packing to meet the Mother.” He let out a long, low whistle. “Kid, let me tell you. <i>No one</i> can do that. And yet somehow you figured it out all on your own on the first try. My advice? To hell with all the fancy dancing. Just practice that and you’re golden.” He cleared his throat. “On your own. Alone. And if I wasn’t absolutely clear: do not come anywhere near me with a ficking sword, or any other hunk of metal, while you‘re augmented. I prefer my limbs attached, thank you very much.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Did… did he just grab his crotch?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Er, what about the other Red magics?” Link asked, eager to change the subject. “Transformation? Siphon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nah,” he repeated. “Don’t even bother with Transformation. Takes years to master, and unless you have a proper trainer you’re more likely than not to wind up feral out in the woods somewhere.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link shuddered.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, yeah,” Grenja said, wagging a finger in his general direction. “Exactly. You’re skilled enough with the bow and sword already. Who knows? Maybe your form might be useful. But ask yourself: do you want to spend the rest of your days as a wolf, running around the forest eating crabbits and ficking she-wolves? Not me brother, no way. I mean, ultimately what you choose to do is up to you. But my considered opinion? Stay the hell away from anyone crazy enough to suggest to you otherwise.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link nodded decisively. Something about this guy—something told him it was better to just agree with whatever he said and double check later with a more, uh… someone that wasn’t him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Noted,” Link said. “What about Siphon?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yeah, I doubt you’ll have issues with that.” He stepped forward, rolling up his sleeve and presenting his arm. “Go on, try it on me now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link boggled at him. “Er, I don’t know how?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Malarky,” Grenja spat. “How do you think it works?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…I guess I siphon your magic?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The man made a rolling motion with his free hand. “Well? Get on with it. I’ll counter if you draw too hard. There’s no danger to either of us.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link still had no idea what he was doing, but he chose to trust in his intuition. He drew on his Red affinity and activated his magic, feeling the familiar burning sensation within. Carefully, he placed his hand on Grenja’s arm. Sure enough, just as he made contact he felt a secondary well of power under his touch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He <i>pulled</i> on that power experimentally, and felt a trickle of raw energy flow from Grenja to him. The sensation was followed immediately by a sharp tug, reversing the flow and then some. Link broke contact and Grenja grinned, patting him on the back.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“See? Told ya. You got it. The rest is just practice.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Huh. That was easy enough. Link examined his hand as the residual red sparks faded away into nothingness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thanks,” he said, looking up. To his surprise, Grenja was already walking off.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Don’t mention it, my man!” he called back over his shoulder, pumping a fist into the air.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Link was left alone, shaking his head in disbelief. What was with these Sheikah anyway? He swore every one of them had to be touched in the head.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No matter; he was done with his obligations for the day. Time now for some well earned rest.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“Dodge!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda hit the ground with a thud and a groan as the shaft of the spear smashed into her ribs. Again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>For some reason or another that was currently eluding her, she had the <i>brilliant</i> idea of putting herself through martial training in hopes of not being as useless in a fight. Why had she thought this was a good idea, again? Currently all she could think of was the shooting pain in her side as she clutched the dirt and winced, fighting through the worst of it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, you’re supposed to <i>dodge!</i>” Oboe said enthusiastically. “One more round?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hah hah. Yes. One more round,” she said, weezing as she hauled herself to her feet. The light hauberk over her clothes did a wonderful job of protecting her from any real damage—thank the Goddesses for imbued armor—but it was still terribly painful to be hit at full force. Also, the armor was a little heavy to be doing such strenuous exercise in. For her, at least. Fighting was hard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Above her, Fi twirled in a complex, rhythmic dance. At Zelda’s prodding, she’d reverse engineered an ability similar to the Cane of Byrna’s physical invigoration effect that Zelda had stumbled across in the course of researching old myths and legends. It was proving to be <i>most</i> useful for training. As ribbons of chromatic mist settled around her, Zelda flexed and stretched, feeling her vigor renewed.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Fi! Much better.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As always, Mistress.” Fi said. She faded back into the aether, and Zelda took a moment to clean herself up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu walked up to her as she was dusting herself off, undoubtedly to provide some more “constructive criticism.” She fell into stance: feet squared, knees bent, shoulders wide, spear at guard. <i>Spear</i>, she mused; really it was just a long heft of wood with a flat and slightly pointier bit of wood tied to the end.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu shook his head, tisking reproachfully. “Too stiff,” he offered. “You’ve got to loosen up.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“But I don’t <i>feel</i> stiff,” Zelda said, exasperated. “I don’t know how to ‘loosen up’ any more than I already am. Honest! I’m doing my best.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu said nothing, opting instead to shove her (in a way that was no doubt intended to be ‘gentle’) with an open palm to her left arm. The force of it twisted her off balance and sent her stumbling forward a couple steps as she struggled not to fall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Too stiff,” he repeated, crossing his arms. “When you’re locked up like that, you can’t stop the force from transferring across your body,” he said. He gestured to the other guardsman. “Oboe?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sir!” Oboe said, falling in next to Zelda. He adopted the familiar stance that Zelda was trying so hard to imitate. Zelda stepped back to watch as Izu positioned himself in the exact same way, yet shoved Oboe much more forcefully than he did her. Oboe allowed his arm to give, but in the same motion pivoted and brought his right arm up to drive the captain aside with the butt of his spear.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu ducked into a low roll and recovered gracefully. “Thank you, Oboe. Excellent form, as always.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sir!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda took a breath, mentally damming up the growing river of frustration as she slid back into stance. She flexed her joints, doing her best to loosen up and adjust her footing to compensate. This was <i>not</i> intuitive. Who could possibly be <i>relaxed</i> when someone was doing their damnedest to hit you with a big pointy stick?!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ehh,” Izu said, giving her a once-over. “Better. Alright, square up. Full spar this time, on my mark. Zelda: remember, you’re trying to hold your opponent off for as long as you can. Don’t let him knock you down, and don’t let him force you out. Stand your ground.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She nodded, facing off with the guardsman. Her whole body trembled with nervous energy. She kept her eyes shifting between his eyes and center of mass; the two locations Izu told her would reveal the most about his intent. Nerves aside, she was determined to be a royal pain in the ass to knock down this time.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Fight!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oboe immediately took a step to her left, skirting the edge of the circle delineating the sparring area. She moved to match him, denying him an opening. He continued to prowl. She shuffled forward a single step, maintaining form but invading <i>his</i> space, careful to stay just out of measure.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Her opponent gave her no pause, taking one long stride to close the distance. Zelda thrust her spear at his chest; once, twice. He deftly sidestepped the first attack, then flicked his own spear in a smooth motion to knock aside the second.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Dammit!</i> She was out of position now, and she knew what that meant. Thinking quickly, she tried for a long sweeping slash to buy her time to recover—but it was too slow. The length of wood moved awkwardly through the air as if she was slicing through honey. Oboe lazily ducked under it and came up within striking distance. Zelda was now even <i>further</i> overextended, and she had no hope of bringing her spear back up to guard in time to avoid getting hit.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In that moment, something inside her broke. She was so, <i>so</i> fed up with this nonsense. And she was <i>not</i> getting hit again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Throwing out everything she had been taught today, she chucked her spear butt-first at her opponent’s head. It was quite possibly the worst throw she could have managed, but it did the trick. He jerked his head aside, buying the time she needed to turn and run in the opposite direction. Having put some distance between them, she turned back… and… <i>were they laughing at her?!</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enough,” Izu called, signalling an end to the duel. Oboe turned to her and bowed. She did the same. The two men looked at each other and burst into another round of laughter.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why are you laughing?” Zelda demanded, impishly stamping her foot. “This is not funny!” She knew her performance today was never going to be stellar; one would have to be a fool to expect to make any tangible progress the very first day of learning a new skill. Still…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No, no,” Izu said, waving her off. “You misunderstand. You did great! That last attempt was by far the best.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Then why are you laughing at me?” she repeated.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your Grace, if I may,” Oboe said, “You managed to figure out something very important there. Something it often takes fresh recruits several weeks to learn.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That being?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you’re not cheating, you’re not trying,” Izu said, grinning. “That’s the long and the short of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The fact of the matter is,” Oboe added, glancing to Izu and then back to Zelda, “Training, kata, form, stances? They’re all crucial. But when you’re in the middle of a fight? None of that matters. You do what you can do to get an edge, and you do <i>everything</i> you can to survive.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Even if it’s ridiculous,” Izu said. “<i>Especially</i> if it’s ridiculous.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Indeed,” Oboe said, nodding to his captain. “And just in case it wasn’t clear: the last thing you want to do in a real fight is throw away your weapon. In any real scenario that would have been completely ridiculous and probably would have gotten you killed. But this isn’t a real scenario, and you aren’t a soldier. You recognized you were in danger, acknowledged you were about to lose, and came up with a creative solution to get yourself out of a bind. And <i>that</i>,” he said, clacking his spear against the ground, “is the most important lesson you’ve learned today.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Well! That certainly made her feel better about herself. She may have failed, but at least she failed in a useful and creative way. She could live with that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As for fighting dirty,” Izu said, “I’d be happy to give you a few tips there relating to Blue magic. Foretelling, mostly. It won’t do you any good right now until you’ve mastered the basics, but perhaps after a couple months of practice? If you decide to stick with it, that is.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda furrowed her brow at that. “Really? I have not ever known Foretelling to be practically useful.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It takes a good bit of practice, and it’s a hell of a lot of information to sift through in the middle of a fight,” he said. “But yes. Being able to predict how your opponent is going to react to a feint, for instance, allows you to set up some really effective combinations.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hmm,” she said, considering. “I hadn’t really ever thought about that.” She supposed it made sense enough. Though, imagining herself in the middle of a fight—mind preoccupied with complex visualizations and sensory overload—left her reeling. She would not want to try that anytime soon.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As I said, don’t try that on your own. Mother-forbid you actually find yourself in a fight, absolutely <i>do not</i> experiment with anything you aren’t already comfortable with. That’s a surefire way to get yourself hurt.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded in acknowledgement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Again?” Oboe asked, eagerness showing in his eyes.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Whyyy</i> was she feeling so masochistic today? Zelda took in a slow, deep breath. “Okay, sure. Let’s go again.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>“And here we are, Your Grace. I have to warn you, though,” High Captain Roesar said, turning to face Zelda and showing a measure of concern. “She isn’t the friendliest of sorts. I honestly have no idea what to expect.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He and Zelda were flanked by Link, Koja, Laylith, and Cove. They stood at the entrance to the quarters where Naibi was being held. <i>Held</i>, and not <i>quartered</i>—which Zelda was told was for Naibi’s own safety. Naturally, Zelda had to wonder what transpired.</span>
<br><br>
<span>They had arrived at Last Bastion within the last hour, and Zelda insisted upon having the meeting as soon as possible. Truth be told, she was rather anxious. The diversion to the Temple of Time had taken significantly longer than Zelda anticipated, and she was here almost a week behind schedule.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Thank you, Captain,” Zelda said, trying to calm her nerves. She held her hands clasped in front of her and nodded to Roesar, then to the guardsmen at the door. “Let us proceed.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>They opened the door. Link and Laylith entered first, followed by herself and Roesar. Koja and Cove waited outside. Zelda scanned the room. It was spacious and grand; fit for guests of the highest station. It featured a balcony, a small study, several paintings and decorative pieces, two beds with quilts embroidered in gold, and a great chandelier that hung low over a massive, ornate oak table.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi, First of the Sunseekers, sat at the far side of the table, reclined with her feet propped atop it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“At long last, Queen Zelda Numenia Proventia of Hyrule—the Champion of Hylia herself!—deigns to grace me with her presence,” the woman said in mock reverence. “Truly, I am honored beyond words, Your Grace.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Mistress,</i> came Fi’s voice, <i>I do not believe her to be—</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Not now, Fi!</i>” Zelda muttered under her breath, masking the words by turning her head and clearing her throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahem. The honor is mine,” Zelda said with a nod of her head. Whatever slights this woman had suffered, Zelda would need to defuse the tension quickly. She approached the table, taking a seat. Roesar sat beside her, and Link and Laylith fanned out to either side. “Let me first say that I sincerely apologize for the delay, and for any other inconveniences or inhospitalities you may have—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—Pfah. Spare me, please,” Naibi said in a thick accent. “I did not come all this way to be coddled by a soft Hylian—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Watch your tone, woman!” Roesar snapped. “This is the <i>Queen of Hyrule</i> you are speaking to!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Captain</i>,” Zelda said, letting some bite into her words. This was going to be difficult enough already. “I am capable of speaking for myself, thank you,” she said. “In the meantime, I believe you said you had other important duties to attend to?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was caught off guard by that and was clearly dissatisfied at the dismissal, but did not seek to challenge her. “You are quite right, Your Grace,” he said, standing and sliding in his chair. He bowed low, first to her, and then to their guest. “If you will excuse me, I will go and attend to them now.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda nodded to him, waiting until she heard the door open and close behind her before continuing. A short breath. She steepled her hands. “As I was saying—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Is this truly necessary?” Naibi interrupted, gesturing to Link and Laylith. “Is the Queen of Hyrule so <i>fearful</i> for her safety that she cannot speak with me alone, in her own fortress? First I am made a prisoner in all but name, and now am treated as little more than a common thug. Is this how you treat with all ambassadors, Your Grace?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda began to mouth a response, but stopped herself. <i>Surely</i> she couldn’t expect—</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Absolutely not,</i> came Laylith’s voice. <i>Don’t even think about it.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda turned, eyeing the older Sheikah woman. Laylith shook her head fractionally.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well?” Naibi demanded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She was indeed a difficult one. Zelda thought back to what Lensa had told her—that supposedly she had been making unreasonable demands since she arrived.</span>
<br><br>
<span>—The thought occurred to her that perhaps this was merely a cultural misunderstanding.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Naibi,” Zelda asked plainly, “do you feel disrespected by me?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Gerudo woman let her feet down, swinging around to rest her head on the backs of her hands with elbows propped against the table. She stared at Zelda, but said nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda had a feeling—an intuition—and chose to pursue it. She was really hoping this wasn’t a mistake…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Allow me to be frank,” Zelda said. “Much rests on the outcome of this meeting. I am here because my kingdom finds itself in the most dire of circumstances. We are at war, and our resources are strained. Many have died, and many more will die before this is over. We have repelled the Blin for now, but it will take <i>decades</i> to reverse and repair the damage this Blight has caused—<i>if</i> we manage it all.” She let her voice rise towards the end to punctuate the gravity of her words.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Any true ally we could find right now,” she continued, softer, “I would consider to be a blessing from the Goddesses themselves. And so I wonder, Naibi: what is it <i>you</i> want? Why are <i>you</i> here? We both know the history between our peoples, and that the tenuous truce we once held was shattered by the raids on our lands that forced my father’s hand almost a decade ago.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And yet—” she gestured to Naibi, then leaned in, lowering her voice. “And yet, here you are. Despite—or perhaps, because of the unrest and instability within the Gerudo nation. Despite the mistrust and disrespect you have been shown by Roesar and his men. Despite the <i>mutual</i> mistrust between our peoples. Despite that, you are still here.” She paused, letting the words settle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now, the Lynx had little to say to me in her missive,” she said. “She offered aid—which, absolutely, we are in desperate need of. One could read this the obvious way; of one party seeking to ingratiate themselves to the other at an opportune time, in hopes of political gain.” She studied Naibi, but the woman had scarcely moved an inch. Zelda decided to continue.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I, however, choose not to believe that.” Zelda turned slightly, placing one hand on the table. She gazed ahead, recalling the events as she spoke. “Naibi, I watched as the Lynx’s messenger fought and died to protect me, after failing to warn me in time of an attempt on my life. An attempt, she claimed, was made by the Exiled King.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Naibi shifted in her seat at his mention. Interesting. Zelda glanced over to Link. He nodded.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Now, a cynical person might believe this all to be a ruse, or a coincidence, or perhaps just opportunism. But I have reason to believe this business with this ‘Exiled King’ runs deeper than just an opportunistic assassination attempt. He’s been rather persistent. Twenty days ago, his agents tried again. But this time? This time they used bombs. Bombs that we have evidence to believe were taken from the stores of Talus, <i>subsequent</i> to it being overrun.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“There is perhaps more to you than I was lead to believe,” Naibi said, speaking up at last. She reclined back in her seat, crossing her legs. “I acknowledge you, Zelda. As to the disrespect I have been shown by your subordinates, I am willing to look past this. As you say, there are far more important matters at hand. Let us start anew, shall we?”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Yes!</i> She knew she was on to something! Zelda smiled, but managed to keep herself in check.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Tell me, Queen of Hyrule, how much have you learned of the coming conflict?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The… the <i>what</i> now?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>Dry sands take me</i>,” Naibi muttered, rubbing her face. “You were chosen as the Champion of Hylia, and yet you are just as clueless—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know that Hylia is dead,” Zelda said quickly, not considering the implications. She was pretty sure she heard Laylith choke behind her. Naibi cocked her head. She looked to be waiting for more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing for it, she supposed. Worst case, Zelda could always have the woman done away with if necessary.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But what <i>did</i> she know? She tried to put together the pieces.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I know that Hylia died to save Hyrule from the Blin,” she said, staring straight ahead as her mind worked, trying to figure out what it was the Gerudo woman was looking for. “She used the last of her power to act through me to save my kingdom when all hope was lost. To be honest, I never really considered what an action like that meant before now. I always assumed that helping us to repel the Blin was cause enough? —But no, that never sat right with me either. Before… whatever happened, that forced Hylia into that state? There is <i>no way</i> a mere Blin army—no matter how large, no matter with how many Warlords or Exiled Kings leading them—there is no way any mortal force could possibly stand before the Mother of Creation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ahead of her, Naibi grinned. “You do not know the half of it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Zelda shuddered. Why did she always have to be right? “I confess, Naibi,” she said. “I am terrified. Here we are discussing a force that defeated a <i>Goddess</i>. In the face of that?” She looked up, shaking her head. “But if there’s anything that we can do—any way at all to get ahead of what might be coming next, I’m willing to do whatever it takes. And if the Lynx has any information that might help?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched as Naibi rose from her seat and walked, slowly, carefully, deliberately around to her side of the table. She stopped and sat at the corner, a few feet away, just as Link rustled at her side.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Zelda, Queen of Hyrule,” she said. “Make no mistake: the fate of the world hangs in the balance. We must move quickly. The game has been set in motion, and it may yet be too late. You must come with me at once to speak with the Lynx. Only <i>she</i> can provide you with further direction.”</span>
<br><br>
