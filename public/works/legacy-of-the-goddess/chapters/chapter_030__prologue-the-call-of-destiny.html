<span>Ari stood guard outside the Council chamber, a few paces opposite another guardsman at the other side of the hall. It was mind-numbing work. At least with watch detail it was <i>outside</i>. Here, his only view was an open hall that led out to the castle antechamber.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was a positively regal view, to be sure. A great chandelier hung midway down the hall. Along one side of the high walls were stained glass murals depicting the Holy Mother and the Celestial Triad; Avalia, Caelon, Vaka, and Nenore. Motes of dust flitted about in rays of light, seemingly cast from above by the Goddesses themselves.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The view got a little stale after the first three hours, though. As did his unprofessional compatriot’s attempts at conversation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari’s thoughts drifted back to the expedition. It bothered him that he hadn’t been chosen. He understood why—only a dozen guardsmen were needed, and any veteran would be picked over a fresh recruit. Still, the disappointment lingered. His uncle had made it sound like he’d be going on adventures regularly. That was the main reason he’d agreed to this job in the first place. He couldn’t shake the feeling of being misled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Time continued to crawl. To pass the hours, Ari amused himself by finding shapes in the sunbeams. If he focused <i>just right</i>, he could almost see the outline of something—someone?—moving through the motes of dust. A young girl, maybe. Her form shimmered like light caught in glass. The patterns shifted with a strange precision, as if she were dancing to some hidden geometry rather than music. He blinked, and the vision scattered back into meaningless sparkles.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A rising cacophony of voices indicated the Council meeting was at a close. Beside him, a door creaked open and Guard Captain Izu stepped through. Ari snapped to arms. The guard opposite him did not. Captain Izu saluted, and Ari returned to rest.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“New guy. How goes it?” Captain Izu asked, coming to stand next to him while he fastened his helmet. His tone was a bit more familiar than Ari was used to.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Sir,” Ari said. “Well enough.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Captain Izu shook his head with a chuckle. “We don’t really do formalities here. Except for show, of course—standard fare around nobles and royals. You’ll get used to it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari gave a slight nod, unsure how to respond. The guard across the hall muttered something under his breath—something about “green boys.” Izu shot him a sharp look, and Ari chose to let it pass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Arlinkar, isn’t it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Just Ari, sir.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Alright then. Arisir it is.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari blinked. “I meant just… ’Ari.’”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The guard across the hall stifled a laugh.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Okay then: Ari,” Izu grinned. “Say, what’s this I hear about you beating Nira in a duel?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari had been asked about that several times now. Apparently it was a bigger deal than he’d thought. He still wasn’t sure what had happened exactly, but that was battle for you. Sometimes instinct took over, and it was over before you knew it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I just got lucky, that’s all,” Ari said with a shrug.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu smiled, crossing his arms. “That so?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shifted uncomfortably. He could tell Izu had read something into his response—something he hadn’t meant to imply. Magical Luck was common enough in duels, but what he’d experienced with Nira had been… different. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Whatever it was, he didn’t want the Captain thinking he was some combat prodigy who’d woven mundane magic into swordplay or developed some masterful secret technique.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Well, in case you haven’t heard, there’s a tourney coming up on Remembrance Day,” Izu said, clapping him on the shoulder. “You should sign up. It’d be nice to have some actual competition for a change.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>So much for that. Ari frowned. He didn’t like to show off—it went directly against the teachings of the Faith. Even if few held strictly to the teachings these days, he did. Although, there <i>were</i> exceptions for festivities and entertainment. And it <i>would</i> be far more interesting than anything else in his life right now…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu cleared his throat.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I’ll think about it,” Ari said. “Thanks for the invite.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Izu and the other guard snapped to arms as the doors opened. Ari followed suit. Izu took point beside a third guard exiting the chamber, and together the two of them escorted the Council members down the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari and his compatriot waited until the chamber emptied before unfastening their helmets and heading out. They were off-duty now. The man gave him a curt nod and headed down the hall. Ari wasn’t sure where to go—maybe the guardsman’s quarters? Or the library? He still intended to look into the King’s—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ari, my boy!” he heard Uncle Raolin call from behind. “Over here!” </span>
<br><br>
<span>Surprised, Ari turned to see his uncle waving at him. He had been speaking with an older nobleman who was just now departing through the smaller side entrance.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari felt a spike of frustration, but forced it down. He’d deal with it later. His uncle meant well—he knew that—but now wasn’t the time or place to hash things out. He waved back and headed inside, managing what he hoped was a convincing smile.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin crossed his arms, beaming. “Hey now. What’s this I hear about you besting Nira in a duel? Why didn’t you tell me over dinner?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari suppressed a groan. “I didn’t think it was a big deal. I just got lucky. That’s all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ah, I see,” his uncle frowned, one hand stroking his beard. “Well,” he said, brightening up. “There’s a tourney coming up on—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Remembrance Day, yeah,” Ari interrupted. “Captain Izu told me. I’ll think about it.” Absentmindedly, he glanced back out of the chamber and down the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari heard the clack of Raolin’s cane as he strode closer. He was doing a poor job of hiding his frustration, as usual.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hey,” Raolin said, leaning forward on his cane. “I’m sorry you didn’t make the expedition. Usually there’s plenty of room for volunteers, but this one’s different—can’t say more than that. I promise it won’t always be like this, though.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>That… okay, that was fair. Ari let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding, feeling some of the tension leave him.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin chuckled, patting him on the side. “Hey. What do you say we catch up with the others? Grab some food and check out the entertainment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari raised an eyebrow. “Entertainment?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ahh!” Raolin’s face lit up and he twirled his cane. “Seff, the Court Minstrel—he’s back in town! He’s an old friend of mine. We used to be part of the same troupe back in my barding days.” He winked. “You’re in for a real treat.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The castle theater was smaller than Ari would have guessed, though somehow it still managed to fit the sixty-odd guests comfortably. A few rows of benches lined the front of the hall, with a balcony towards the front reserved for royalty and their personal guests. It was currently empty.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Uncle Raolin had managed to snag a seat on one of the benches up front. Ari stood just off to the side nearby. A few of the older guests also sat on the benches, but most stood in a loose crowd just behind and to the sides.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The murmurings of the audience died down as stagehands closed the shutters on the windows. Darkness filled the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room went silent.</span>
<br><br>
<span>A dozen candles flickered to life. Their flames, reflected in silvered glass, revealed a single man seated on a wooden stool beside a golden harp. He had sharp, angular features and stylish white hair.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff?</span>
<br><br>
<span>He was dressed immaculately, wearing a black tunic fashioned from Akhari silk over a fine, feathered shirt. His right hand played back and forth over the instrument, producing clean notes following the scale. The audience held rapt with palpable anticipation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He plucked out a few notes, and the song began. His solemn voice washed over the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 50px">
    <p>
        <span><i>Oh; Sovereign Goddess, Three</i></span><br>
        <span><i>We do sing our praise to thee</i></span><br>
        <span><i>To Caelon’s mind of gold</i></span><br>
        <span><i>And Vaka’s might untold</i></span><br>
        <span><i>And dear Nenore’s love…</i></span><br>
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<span>The melody sped up. A faint chorus of voices joined in from the darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 50px">
    <p>
        <span><i>With her brilliant mind</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Yes, oh; Caelon, stars aligned!</i></span><br>
        <span><i>She sealed away the night</i></span><br>
        <span><i>And brought the world to right!</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Wrest order from the void</i></span><br>
        <span><i>And set-the-world-and-heavens-going</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Sun-and-stars-and-moon-in-motion!</i></span><br>
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<span>Seff stood and leaned out over the stage, whipping his hands through the smoke of the candles. The flames rose and intensified. Behind him, the harp continued to play on its own. Ari could <i>feel</i> the energy building in the air—could almost <i>see</i> the song come to life. Horns and a drum sounded with the next verse.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 50px">
    <p>
        <span><i>Then Vaka rose</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Such a fearsome sight!</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Her eyes wreathed in fire</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Body bathed in light!</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Day and night she fought</i></span><br>
        <span><i>And with her blood she bought</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Solace from eternal night!</i></span><br>
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<span>Flames roared to life across the stage, revealing dancers and streaming ribbons. The chorus cried out and several other instruments joined in.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left: 50px">
    <p>
        <span><i>“Life, evermore!” dear Nenore swore</i></span><br>
        <span><i>“Ne’er again, shall the Darkness reign!”</i></span><br>
        <span><i>‘To her children gave</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Courage to stand brave!</i></span><br>
        <span><i>Will to face the night</i></span><br>
        <span><i>And fight!</i></span><br>
    </p>
</div>
<br>
<span>The music reached a crescendo and faded abruptly, as did the flames. Instruments continued to play in the background with the chorus singing the names of the Goddesses in harmony.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…</span>
<br><br>
<span>The shutters swung open as the performance ended, flooding the hall with light and revealing eight other performers who had joined Seff on stage. The troupe took a bow together, and the audience erupted with cheers and applause. Ari joined in, genuinely impressed—he had never seen anything quite like it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff motioned for the audience to settle as the curtains behind him drew to a close. The other performers disappeared from view and the shutters dimmed once more. Seff cleared his throat in dramatic fashion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The history of Avendal has always been one of hardship and adversity,” Seff said, pausing to let the words settle over the audience. “In these times, we are blessed with relative comfort and prosperity. But it was not always so!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Behind him the curtain drew back to show animated wooden props painted with meticulous detail. On one side of the stage rose a great tower; on the other stretched the sea. Seff stepped to the side and continued his narration.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Long ago, the twin kingdoms of Farwatch and Yr coexisted in peace. But everything changed when the Blin attacked!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Drums sounded as a crude ship sailed in from the east, crashing against the tower. “Blin” (really just actors covered in skins and wearing horns) leapt from the ship and attacked the tower.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hordes numbering in the hundreds of thousands invaded the eastern coastlands. Their might and sheer numbers quickly overwhelmed Farwatch’s defenders, making short work of the ancient city. Countless were killed, priceless artifacts lost, and ancient tomes of knowledge burned as the city was razed to the ground! Those who could, fled to Yr…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The tower prop collapsed into pieces as fabric flames rose to engulf the debris. The set pieces shifted to reveal a Blightkin savagely hacking at a screaming woman—drawing gasps and muttered curses from the audience. Further down the stage, a hulking Dreadkin ran a soldier through with a spear while two others fled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The curtain drew closed as Seff returned to center stage, pacing deliberately and pausing to punctuate the story.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The people were horrified, stunned, and appalled by the slaughter at Farwatch. Despite their desperate prayers and offerings, the Goddesses were nowhere to be found! Many felt betrayed. Why had they allowed this to happen? Had the people been forsaken?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“As the hordes turned toward Yr, tensions rose. Should they sally out and fight? Try to hold out against the coming siege? Flee? Amidst a growing panic, the Council of Yr and the Twelve Sages convened, together with the King of Farwatch and his advisers.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Together, they spent three days locked away in silence. And when at last they emerged, it was revealed that Avalia herself had given them direction!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff stepped aside. The curtains opened again to show an actress dressed in white robes with long, golden hair. A ray of light shone down on her from above and the people around her bowed in reverence. She stepped forward and addressed the crowd. The light from above followed her movement.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“My children! You must flee and seek refuge west, beyond the mountains! There I will carve out a fertile valley for you, safe from these wretched voidspawn!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The King of Farwatch rushed forth and fell to his knees, pleading. “Your Grace! What are we to do of the approaching hordes? We cannot travel safely over the plains while they roam free. Please, you must aid us!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The Avalia-actress crossed her arms and held her chin in thought. She strode to the front of the stage and paced. “Perhaps… yes! Perhaps there is one among you who will be my champion? A courageous, noble knight? Selfless and brave, willing to stand against the darkness and protect my people?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The audience murmured among themselves. Seff stepped forward, though the actors paid him no mind. “Well?!” he demanded, arms outstretched. “Avalia needs a champion! Is there no one among you with the spirit and valor to stand against the hordes?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari felt a shove from behind and stumbled forward. Before he could recover, the light from the rafters swung to focus on him. His breath caught. He froze, suddenly desperate to disappear. Shielding his eyes with one hand, he squinted into the brightness. The hall went still.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh no. This was really happening.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Dear Avalia,</i> Ari silently prayed. <i>Holy Mother. Goddess Above, please—</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“Brave knight!” the Avalia-actress called. “Your spirit is second to none. Come forward, and accept my blessing!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All around him, the crowd cheered. An auspicious and triumphant fanfare sounded out with horns blaring. Streaming tinsel fell from above. The light from the rafters dimmed, and Ari saw that Seff was waving him over and offering a helping hand onto the stage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>This was too much. It was all just <i>too much</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something inside him snapped. The Goddesses wanted to have their fun with him? Fine. He would oblige.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari took a breath, glanced back at the crowd, and winked. He took a running start, dove onto the stage in a roll, and sprang to his feet. The audience roared with wild applause. Sweeping around to face them, he struck what he hoped was a suitably heroic pose.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff stepped up beside him, applauding along with the crowd. “Well, folks—looks like we’ve found our champion!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>All eyes turned to Ari, and the realization struck: he had no idea what to do next. He stood stiffly, looking between the actors and the crowd. The applause died down and an awkward silence settled over the hall.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Erm…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff spoke up with a stage whisper. “Mr. Hero, I think you’re supposed to accept the blessing of Avalia.” A bout of laughter rose from the crowd.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Right.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari approached and dropped to one knee before the Avalia-actress. The light shone from above on the two of them. Somewhere, a harp played out a simple melody.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“O, Courageous Hero!” she called out, her voice ringing across the stage. Ari winced—he hadn’t realized they needed to project quite so loudly for the hall. “Rise, and accept my blessing. Go forth and bring peace to Avendal!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The room dimmed and the light focused now on Ari alone, intensifying as the horns and harp sounded out another fanfare. The Avalia-actress and the King scrambled away in the darkness.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff strode back to center stage, motioning for for Ari to stand. He did so. The light from above faded, and the room lit up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And so, the Champion of Avalia sallied forth alongside the stalwart defenders of the Realm, bringing battle to the <i>evil Blin</i> and buying time for the people to flee to Avalia’s land of promise and prosperity!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the back of the stage, three actors dressed as knights entered from the left carrying banners and spears. The crowd shouted and stamped their feet with encouragement from Seff. A moment later, four actors dressed as Blightkin entered from the right to boos and jeers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari didn’t hesitate this time, opting to jog over to the waiting soldiers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wait! Mr. Hero!” Seff called from behind. Startled, Ari turned back to see him waving a wooden sword.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It’s dangerous to go alone. Here, take this!” He tossed the sword toward Ari, but it clattered to the floor several feet short—likely intentional, judging by the audience’s laughter. With a sigh, Ari retrieved it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Without warning, the knights behind him charged the Blin. Ari scrambled after them, but too late. One caught a spear in the chest and fell, screaming dramatically. Another swung and took down his comrade’s attacker, but was himself felled by two more. The last soldier turned to run, leaving Ari to face the three remaining enemies alone. One stabbed at him with an exaggerated thrust. Ari effortlessly batted the attack away, yanked on the spear, and smacked the actor on the back as he fell to the ground with a <i>yelp</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The other two Blin actors were well out of range and backing away. Ari stood his ground, unsure if he was actually supposed to fight. The fallen actors crawled off-stage.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The knights fought valiantly and drew the attention of the advancing armies, but the brutish hordes prevailed by sheer numbers alone! Desperate, the Champion made a last stand at the Temple of Avalia, buying time for his allies to retreat!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Drums thumped, slow and steady. The two Blightkin actors on the right side of the stage were joined by another three Blightkin and a Dreadkin. From the left side, a two-tiered wooden platform with a fanciful temple backdrop was wheeled in. Taking cue from Seff, Ari hopped up to the second tier, but not before grabbing a spear left by one of the fallen soldiers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The actors advanced one at a time, swinging wildly and nowhere near Ari. He stabbed at the first with his spear. The man grabbed the spear under his arm, cried out, and fell on his back. A second charged and roared, stopping just outside of striking distance. Ari stepped in and made a slashing motion. The Blightkin-actor fell away clutching at his neck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The remaining four actors spread across the lower rung of the platform. The three Blightkin rushed him at once. Backed against a wall, Ari felt a surge of panic—then had to remind himself this wasn’t a real fight. He slashed at one, who fell away screaming. The other two grabbed him. The Dreadkin advanced with a spear. Ari struggled, jerked free, bopped one on the head, and drew the wooden sword across the other’s chest. They fell away. He readied himself for the Dreadkin’s attack, but his final opponent halted, then turned and fled.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The Champion succeeded in buying time, though many fell that day,” Seff called out, his tone somber. “The hordes retreated and victory was won, but the cost was high… for the Champion of Avalia himself succumbed to his wounds after the battle.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari looked around uncertainly. He was supposed to be wounded, apparently. Not knowing what else to do, he clutched his chest and dropped to one knee, using the sword to prop himself up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The curtains fell and the fallen actors rose to line up across the stage. The rest of the troupe hurried to join in.</span>
<br><br>
<span>One of the Blightkin actors clapped him on the shoulder, causing him to miss Seff’s next line. “Hey kid—good job! But easy with the sword next time, yeah? That thing hurts!” He rubbed at his head with a wince.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari winced. “Ah. Sorry.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“C’mon,” the actor said, pulling Ari towards the center of the growing line.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The curtains rose to thunderous applause. The troupe bowed together, and Ari with them. Seff called out each of the cast by name, and they each posed and took a bow in turn.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And lastly, let’s hear it for the Champion of Avalia!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The audience erupted with cheers. Ari stepped forward and flourished his wooden sword, playing into the excitement. He couldn’t help but smile. What had he been so worried about? That hadn’t been bad at all.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>After the play, Seff exchanged pleasantries with Ari, though the man seemed distracted and eager to leave. The rest of the troupe had already dispersed while a couple of stagehands remained behind to clean up.</span>
<br><br>
<span>As Seff took his leave, Ari scanned the thinning crowd and spotted his uncle still speaking with the same nobleman from earlier. He waved, intending to head over, but Raolin shook his head and held up a hand. Ari stopped. His uncle smiled and gave him a thumbs-up before turning back to his companion. With a hand at the other man’s back, Raolin gestured toward the exit, and the two wandered off together.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Oh well. He could catch up with his uncle later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The hall was nearly empty now. Should he head back to the guard’s chambers? Or maybe the library? But something felt… <i>off</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>With a growing panic, Ari felt at his chest. The necklace! How had he lost it? Was it—</span>
<br><br>
<span>He dashed backstage and slid under the curtains, searching for the temple prop. It was hard to make out in the dim light, though he found it off to the side and scoured over every inch of the platform in the hopes that the necklace had snagged on something during the scuffle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>No such luck.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He darted around, searching for a stagehand—anyone—but the area was deserted. Just as he turned to head back to the hall, he heard a door slam shut somewhere nearby.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari took off in the direction of the sound. Near the back of the staging area were two service entrances on either side. He opened the door on the left and dashed through. Just ahead was a dusty storage area, and to the right a stone wall. To his left—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Midway down the hall to the left was a spiral staircase. His necklace hung from the railing, caught on the iron.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari breathed a silent prayer of thanks to the Goddesses as he jogged over and retrieved the necklace. The golden fragment rested in his palm, warm against his skin. Had one of the actors tried to steal it? He fastened it back around his neck with a sigh of relief. He would need to be more careful—this was a priceless family heirloom. What would Uncle Raolin think if he’d—</span>
<br><br>
<span>Turning, he bumped into none other than Seff.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Hello, Mr. Hero,” Seff said.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari backed away, regarding the man with suspicion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff tsked. “Oh, come now. I thought we were friends.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Did you—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Yes, I stole your necklace,” Seff said with a shrug. “Well, to be precise, I had one of the actors do it for me. Same thing, really.” He smiled. “But don’t worry—it seems I couldn’t take it from you if I wanted to. It would find its way back to you one way or another.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stared at him, stunned by the man’s sheer audacity.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Seff regarded him with a curious expression. “You really don’t know what it is, do you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That’s none of your business,” Ari said, turning to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, but it is my concern, Mr. Hero. In fact, I believe it may be everyone’s concern, soon enough.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari felt his temper rising. What in the blighted ruins was this thieving lunatic going on about? Whatever it was, it didn’t matter. He continued on his way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“You feel it when you hold it, don’t you?” Seff called to him. “When you look at it? It resonates with you, doesn’t it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari stopped in his tracks, hand going to his chest. How could he…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I thought as much,” Seff said with a <i>tsk</i> from behind. Ari turned back to find the man sauntering toward him, an impish grin on his face. “My, my. Nenore always did have a sense of humor. It seems you may well be the Goddesses’ champion after all.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ari shook his head. This <i>Seff</i> had to be mad—there was no other explanation. He turned to leave.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Gather your courage, Mr. Hero,” Seff said, catching Ari’s eye as he reached the door at the end of the hall. “I expect you’ll need it in the times to come.”</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Nira rode through the village gate and made her way to the stable. She dismounted, pressing two green crysts into the stableboy’s hand as she passed him the reins. The boy pocketed one with a word of thanks and led the horse away.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She had diverged from Xayla’s entourage to reach this village, taking a circuitous route with several stops to ensure she wasn’t being tracked. The group would be camping at the shores of Lake Nialay soon, boarding ships to sail downriver come morning. Nira could easily make up the time—a swift horse and a few hours’ ride during the twilight hours would see her back with them. It wasn’t the safest method of travel, but nothing she couldn’t handle.</span>
<br><br>
<span>For now though, she had urgent business to attend to. Vian herself had arranged a secure meeting at a long-abandoned Veilwyrd outpost and training ground.</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was only one reason Vian would arrange a meeting like this. Nira clung desperately to the hope she was wrong.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The dirt road to the Tower stirred memories of her early training days, years ago now. Unpleasant memories, though comforting in their own way. She had been broken here—utterly broken—but the Veilwyrd had reforged her into something with purpose. A tool to serve her kingdom. Without them, she would have been nothing. That orphan girl scraping by in Castletown’s underworld had no future.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She passed the old barracks—now an inn—and came to the base of the Tower. A man in loose clothing stood by the door, leaning against it as he whittled away at what looked like a pipe.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She’s expecting you,” he said, making way.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira nodded to him and entered the building.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Two knocks on the great oak door leading to Vesyrn’s old office. Vesyrn: her immediate superior, one of Vian’s two lieutenants, and the closest thing Nira ever had to a father.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Enter,” the response came. Nira did so, closing the door behind her with a thud. A thin plume of dust billowed across the floor.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Nira, dear. Have a seat,” Vian said to her, somber and mirthless. She sat alone, staring out the window.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira bowed reverently, taking a seat opposite the venerable woman. It had been a few years since she had last seen Vian in person. Age lines marred her face more heavily than Nira remembered, and her hair had gone completely white. She wore simple clothing; a shawl bearing the silver eye of the Veilwyrd and a wide-brimmed hat with dangling tassels.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira shifted uncomfortably in the hard wooden chair. “You wished to see me?” The tension in the air was palpable—Vian clearly wasn’t looking forward to this conversation any more than she was.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vian turned to her, eyes heavy. “I am so sorry to ask this of you, child. But I can trust no other.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The last embers of hope hiding at the back of Nira’s mind flickered out. She nodded slowly. There was only one reason Vian would break the chain of command like this, arranging a meeting here of all places.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It was him, then? You’re certain?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vian grimaced, gazing up at the heavens. “As certain as we can be about these things.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira could feel the old woman’s pain. Her own emotions threatened to overwhelm her, but she forced them down. Not now. She would deal with it later.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He was seen consorting with an Akhari agent,” Vian said. “We caught her. Turns out she was part of a renegade faction we’ve been watching—camping out in the southern highlands. Little more than that, unfortunately.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“And?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“We found a magically empowered strain of scoranta venom among her possessions,” Vian said. “I witnessed its effects myself. There’s no mistaking it.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira clenched her jaw, fingers digging into her scalp. She didn’t know what upset her more: that he had done it, or that he’d been caught. “Why?” she whispered. She didn’t trust herself to speak any louder. “How could he be so foolish…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why does anyone commit treason and attempt regicide?” Vian mused. “I am sure he has a compelling story, and is suitably convicted.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It doesn’t make sense!” Nira cut back. “If he wanted the King dead, why use poison? And why involve the <i>Akhari</i>? And what does this rogue faction have to do with any of it?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Your guess is as good as mine, dear,” Vian answered in a hushed tone.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The two sat in silence. Nira tried to gather her thoughts. She felt sick.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Why me? Allanah knows, doesn’t she?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“No,” Vian said pointedly.</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>What?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>“You are the first to know, outside of my personal cell,” Vian said, answering the unasked question. She looked worried, rubbing her hands together restlessly. “I couldn’t risk telling her—she would confront him immediately, and they would be at each other’s throats. Who knows what that would mean for the kingdom. No. He trusts you. If we handle this carefully, we might still avert disaster.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira froze, her thoughts catching up to her. “But, how did you know I’m not—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Oh, don’t think I don’t know about your <i>experiments</i>,” Vian said, a note of derision seeping into her voice. “Nothing happens in Castletown without my knowledge, child. If you were working with him, those wouldn’t be the most productive of endeavors, hmm?” She frowned, her expression softening. “Besides, I know how close you are with Xayla. For a moment I wondered if it was merely a ruse—if perhaps you were sabotaging her efforts—but you would never betray her, now would you?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira tried to speak, but her mind had ceased to function. She only gaped wordlessly at Vian.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vian let out a sardonic laugh. “You’re hardly the first Veilwyrd with fiendish hobbies. And if we interfered every time a <i>royal</i> ordered something clandestine and illegal, there’d be a civil war every other generation.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira fell back into her chair. The weight of it all was too much, even for her. Where to start?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Unbidden, a memory surfaced—words spoken to her years ago during training. <i>Focus on what’s in front of you. There’s only one path forward. Take the next step, and sort out the rest later.</i></span>
<br><br>
<span>She swallowed hard and pushed the thoughts aside. “Last seen?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vian smiled—it was unnerving. “He’s been tasked to the Seekers. Supposedly tracking down a rogue mage in the hills north of Arikton. Left three days ago, expected back a few days before you arrive back with Xayla.” She rubbed her temple. “You won’t have much time. I’ll need to keep him occupied without raising suspicion. If he hasn’t realized he’s compromised by then, he will shortly after.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Parameters?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“He will try and approach you,” Vian said, leaning forward and lacing her fingers. “Learn what you can, but don’t tip your hand to anyone. He won’t leave himself vulnerable. I expect he’s turned a few already.” She chewed at her lip. “It won’t be easy. I’ll provide what assistance I can, but… no promises. We must avoid this coming to light at all costs.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira nodded, resigned. In other words, she would bear the entirety of the risk. “Anything else I should know?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Vian shook her head. “I’ll keep you apprised if I learn anything or if the situation changes. Expect a message waiting when you get back to Netbrook.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira stood and pressed her fist to her heart, bowing her head. Vian mirrored the gesture before dismissing her with a slight nod.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Goddesses’ fortune, child. The future of the kingdom may well rest with you.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira turned to leave. Nothing more needed to be said. Vesyrn had betrayed the kingdom and was conspiring with an enemy faction to unknown ends. No one else could act without throwing the kingdom into chaos, and so it fell to her. Her feelings didn’t matter—she was a tool, and she would serve her purpose.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Best get going. Daylight was waning, and she still had a long ride ahead.</span>

    <span><b><u>Xayla’s Journal - Expedition to Nalvora’s Pass</u></b></span>
</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>Day 1, 24th of Last Storms:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I’m actually doing this. I’m actually going to see Nineve!</span>
<br><br>
<span>I’m going to chronicle the entire journey. I doubt any but me will ever read this, but in my studies I have often lamented that people did not journal more frequently. Journals are such wondrous troves of knowledge!</span>
<br><br>
<span>I digress…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira was initially concerned that the dreams involving the Avali River may refer to the Caelydri themselves. However, as I argued with her, the Caelydri have held peaceful relations with our people since time immemorial. I have no fear of an attack. They are and have always been decidedly isolationist (and more than a little xenophobic). Nira was persuaded by my arguments.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The “mountain in the east” from my dreams likely refers to Blin. Thurdan is unconcerned, though I have not shared details of the dreams nor their nature. I trust the High Captain to do his job, but perhaps I should look more closely at reports from Talus when I return.</span>
<br><br>
<span>My only hypotheses concerning the river are that either the dreams are metaphorical, or that they refer to some natural disaster. If they are metaphorical, I certainly have no idea as to their meaning. And if they refer to some natural disaster, it is unlike anything we have records of. In any case, I hope that Nineve will be able to shed light on the subject. She is over five thousand years old, after all. The secrets her mind must hold…</span>
<br><br>
<span>My secondary objective is to try and obtain a fourth shard of Mind. Nira is dubious the Caelydri will just give me the shard, and we have little to offer them in return. I freely admit it is unlikely, but it has to be worth a shot? They’ll believe me at least about the urgency and nature of the dreams. The remaining fragments are lost to us, though with her help and her memory, perhaps we may locate more. Dare I hope to reunite the shards and wield Caelon’s Celestial Light for myself?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira still insists that I take the Crown. I still believe myself unfit to govern a kingdom. Until now, I’ve held out hope for Father’s recovery. It pains me to admit it, but she’s likely right on that count. Oh, Father… We never did see eye to eye, but I miss you so dearly. I wish I had just one more day with you. One day—is that so much to ask? I hope you’re not in pain. I’ll continue to pray to Avalia for your recovery.</span>
<br><br>
<span>For now, I have named Adresin as Prime Chancellor in my absence. It’s a compromise, and hopefully enough to show the Council I’m taking their concerns seriously. As the ranking member of the royal family, I still retain my authority, but this defers much of that authority to someone more experienced. I have also agreed to hold discussions with him and the other high nobles regarding succession when I return. That should ease the current tensions and buy me time. I still don’t fully understand why they’re so fixated on this—Father could still recover—but Nira says their primary concern is about lineage and ensuring a smooth transition of power. I suppose being the only heir without children of my own makes them nervous.</span>
<br><br>
<span>On a lighter note, Seff is back in town. I had hoped to see his performances. It’s a shame I’ll likely miss them. They’re always so delightful—though I do wish that he wouldn’t take so many liberties with history. Common understanding is bad enough as it is.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The journey should take 21–23 days in total. Nine days to reach Nalvora’s Pass, a day or three for the actual meeting (depending on how receptive they’re feeling this time of year), and eleven days back. We can sail directly to Avalia’s Watch on the way there, but the return trip will require overland travel heading back upstream. Given the size of our entourage, Nira expects the journey to be mostly uneventful until we reach Avalia’s Watch. From there however, it may get a bit dicey. Is it odd that I find the prospect of danger exciting?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The core of my entourage consists of a dozen senior guardsmen, a master navigator, two healers, and Nira. Naturally, we will be accompanied by sailors on the way to Avalia’s Watch. Once there, we’ll pick up more soldiers to accompany us to Nalvora’s Pass. For the return trip, it will just be the core group. We will likely meet up with a caravan somewhere to travel back north.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I am so excited! I have much more to say, but Nira’s fussing at me to put away my quill and prepare.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 2, 25th of Last Storms:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Nira returned sometime during the night. She’s been unusually quiet, and I can tell something’s bothering her. Veilwyrd business, no doubt—though this feels more personal than usual. I won’t pry. She never opens up to me anyway. But normally I can at least offer some comfort just by being there for her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I worry for her. It’s not healthy what she does to herself.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We’re boarding the ships today. “Ships” I am reminded to call them, and not “boats.” Sailors are so passionate when it comes to their vessels. They even name them after women and speak of them with romantic imagery. Do they not have wives back home? I will never understand it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The women (myself, Nira, one of the healers, and four of the guardsmen) will share quarters in one of the three <s>boats</s> SHIPS. I hope it’s not too cramped.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I hope to see some interesting creatures on the way! I’ve never seen Gekkar, skliks, or brinemurks up close. Maybe I’ll even get to do some sketches…</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 3, 26th of Last Storms:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing interesting, unfortunately. It was raining all day, so I spent most of it below deck studying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Something I noticed while studying: mentions of Fae abruptly vanish from cultural records near the end of the Forsaken Era. I can’t recall a single mention of them in any manuscript from the last 500 years, yet they were referenced quite frequently in earlier texts. Why the sudden disappearance?</span>
<br><br>
<span><u>Note:</u> Need to cross reference manuscripts from between the Akharic Wars and Arminel’s Conquest. I doubt it was anything gradual—there has to be a specific event or catalyst that caused the folklore to fall out of favor. If I look closely at the timeline, I should be able to find it.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 4, 27th of Last Storms:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Eeeeeeeee! I saw a cephalok colony! They were swimming in the eddies up against the cliffs near the Fork. We couldn’t get too close—they kept lobbing rocks at us—but that didn’t stop me from Scrying them!</span>
<br><br>
<span>It was absurdly difficult. Correcting for the ship’s rocking motion while scrying was challenging enough, and the sensation is already unpleasant to begin with. I’m not eager to try it again, but the views I got were definitely worth it.</span>
<br><br>
<span>THEY HAVE TATTOOS! It’s incredible! I mean, I knew from reading but I had no idea how intricate the designs were. So pretty!</span>
<br><br>
<span>Ivrin (the ship’s captain) said they’re mostly harmless if you keep your distance, only getting aggressive when threatened. He mentioned it’s unusual to see them in such large numbers though—perhaps it’s mating season? Either way, I’m so fortunate to have witnessed this! I really need to schedule a proper expedition to study them in detail.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It’s raining again today but I’m going to tough it out in the hopes I get to see more.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 5: 28th of Last Storms</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>No cephaloks. And I overdid it with Scrying. Nira had to Siphon some magic to me to prevent exhaustion. Need to be more careful.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Disembarking today for Avalia’s Watch. Finally. I hate ships. I never want to do this again. It’s so cramped and cold and musty and I have no privacy. And the sailors smell something horrid. Why can’t they just bathe regularly like decent folk? Gross.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 6: 29th of Last Storms</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Finally made it to Avalia’s Watch. Got a hot bath and an actual meal for a change. Too bad we can’t stay longer.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The most dangerous leg of the journey is ahead of us. How exciting! It’ll be four days of hiking through wilderness both ways. We’ll be picking up a dozen soldiers from Avalia’s Watch, as well as a few oxgoats. I’ll be riding one bred specifically for travel in the area, as will our healers. Nira doubts we’ll be able to keep up with the group otherwise. She’s probably right.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We’ll be following the mountains as far inland as we can manage. The forest is much thinner there, and unless we’re particularly unlucky it will allow us to completely avoid any Gekkar. Biro (our master navigator) says they’re actually fairly skittish and aren’t much of a threat, so long as we don’t make the mistake of getting anywhere near their breeding grounds. I had hoped to see one…</span>
<br><br>
<span>Apparently, the biggest threats are Wulfkin and Kaiserok. Kaiserok are always dangerous, but if you spot them first you can bunch up and scare them off. With sparse tree cover though, that’s harder to do. Biro says he’s seen them crash through canopies and snatch people. Terrifying.</span>
<br><br>
<span>He also says that Wulfkin won’t come near as long as we’re in a large enough group, and so it’s critically important not to break up or go off alone, even for a few minutes. A shame, really—I’d love to study the local flora more closely. This region has such a fascinating variety of poisonous plants. Perhaps one day I’ll manage a proper research expedition here.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 7: 30th of Last Storms</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Nothing particularly eventful thus far, unless you count a guardsman getting attacked by hornabees. I was promised danger! (I jest, of course.)</span>
<br><br>
<span>The guardsman is fine, by the way. Well, he will be. We brought healers for a reason.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The scenery is beautiful, though not terribly different from the forests back home. I did manage some careful Scrying without overdoing it this time—and discovered something fascinating! What looked like ancient ruins partially reclaimed by the forest. I couldn’t make out much detail through all the trees and overgrowth, but the stonework seemed deliberate. Organized. I wonder what they were? Perhaps remnants from before the Forsaken Era? I’ll have to look into historical records when I return—there might be mentions of settlements this far south that I’ve overlooked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Side note: well-tended oxgoats smell better than sailors. Who would have thought?</span>
<br><br>
<span>Making camp here is interesting. They set up wedge structures to hold firewood in the shape of a “V”. As it burns from the center, the upper logs roll down and keep the fire fed throughout the night. It also allows for overhead covering if it rains. How clever! The group sets up a few of them around camp before nightfall—works both as a deterrent and to minimize distractions for those on watch.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Some of the soldiers were grumbling about the pace we were keeping. Nira shut them down fast—told them they were welcome to lag behind if they wanted, that way they could draw any fiends toward themselves and away from the rest of us. “At least then you’d finally be useful,” she said. Mother’s mercy, woman. Brutal.</span>
<br><br>
<span>…I love Nira. She’s tough. Fierce. Doesn’t let anyone or anything stand in her way. I wish I was more like her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(Needless to say, the soldiers haven’t complained any since.)</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 8: 31st of Last Storms</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>We lost a soldier and a guardsman today. They wandered off for some privacy shortly after we made camp, and were eaten by skittermaws. What a foolish way to die.</span>
<br><br>
<span>(I do wonder if skittermaws could be tamed, though…)</span>
<br><br>
<span>I miss Anli. What might she be doing right now, I wonder?</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 9: 32nd of Last Storms</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>Almost there! Just a few hours’ trek and we’ll be at Nalvora’s Pass.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Biro mentioned he’s surprised by how uneventful the journey has been so far. I should thank the Goddesses for our good fortune.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">-o-</div>
<br>
<span>Xayla sat alone in a shallow sandy pool, shaded by the cliffs overhead from the midday sun. She’d sent word ahead and was now waiting for an emissary. Nira and a guard detail waited some distance behind—she had instructed them not to interfere or approach, no matter what happened.</span>
<br><br>
<span>At the far end of the pool, a small fish with silvery scales darted about—an offering to her host, as was customary. She had also brought trinkets and baubles as collateral in case of social missteps. Nothing particularly valuable, but each was handmade by a master craftsman with elaborate care. The Caelydri had an odd sense of aesthetics, and even odder sensibilities.</span>
<br><br>
<span>An hour passed. Two.</span>
<br><br>
<span>In Avendal, keeping a guest waiting like this would have been seen as an affront to Avalia herself. But Xayla knew from her reading that the emissary would be watching from a distance, judging whether their guest could exhibit patience and restraint. They might require a full day or two of observation before agreeing to meet. No matter—she was determined to wait as long as necessary.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The shadow of the hillside stretched longer as the afternoon wore on. Xayla meditated, clearing her mind and focusing on her breathing, on the gentle sounds of the river nearby, on the ambient noises of nature. She felt the fish brush against her feet occasionally, and tried not to think about it—the offering wasn’t meant to be a companion.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Just when she was considering heading back to camp for the day, a sleek humanoid figure breached the water across the way and landed gracefully on shore. They made it seem effortless—as easy as an experienced rider dismounting a horse. At this distance, she couldn’t tell if they were male or female; most Caelydri appeared considerably more androgynous in both form and presentation than Avalians did.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To Xayla’s Avalian eyes, Caelydri faces appeared bald and somewhat childlike, with a tapered caudal keel and fin at the back of their heads in place of hair. Their eyes were elongated with a slight forward slant, positioned closer to the sides of their heads than the center. Long fins protruded from their forearms, hips, and calves, while their hands and feet were webbed. She found them <i>most fascinating</i>.</span>
<br><br>
<span>The sleek figure drew near. Male, Xayla observed, noting the widening face and subtle angles from jaw to forehead. His pale blue skin was smooth and glossy from head to toe. He wore no clothing, but adorned himself with all manner of ornamentation—mostly colored glass, beads, and rough-hewn gems strung together with rope-like fibers.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla rose and gestured in greeting; elbows out and fingers of both hands forming a sphere. The emissary neared and returned the gesture.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I am honored by the presence of my elder,” Xayla said. She didn’t actually know his age, but it seemed a safe assumption he was far older than she.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Greetings, daughter of Avalia,” the Caelydri said. He sat and snatched the fish from the pool, biting through its head with a sickening <i>crunch</i>. Rows of jagged, sharp teeth lined his mouth.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla carefully maintained her composure as she settled back into the pool. “May I know the name of he who graciously hosts me today?” she asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“This one is Golvara,” he replied between bites.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla waited for him to finish. After a couple more bites, he held what remained of the fish by the tail and swallowed it whole. An uncomfortable silence followed. Golvara said nothing more, and Xayla couldn’t tell where he was looking—Caelydri eyes were black and lacked irises. She wasn’t sure whether to speak or wait.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I trust wisest Nineve has received my message?” she ventured after about three minutes.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“She has,” came Golvara’s reply.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Right… “And… what does the Wisest have to say?” Xayla asked.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ⰩⰃ Ⱀ’Ⱉ’ⰘⰡⰄⰄ ⰄⰏⰄ ⰪⰂ’ⰦⰏ Ⱐ’ⰉⰋ Ⱋ’ⰊⰮⰃ Ⰸ’Ⰵ’ Ⱙ’ⰕⰉ,” Golvara said in his native tongue. The sounds flowed like water, punctuated by hard breaks where the current crashed against riverbanks. It was beautiful, though the meaning escaped her entirely. What had he said?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The day grows long,” he said tersely, “and Golvara has little patience for petulant children.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Mother’s mercy—she had already offended him. Xayla scrambled for one of the baubles in her pack, selecting a loop of silver with several smaller loops of varying sizes embedded in its ring.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please, dear elder, forgive my petulance,” she said, offering up the bauble with both hands extended and bowing her head slightly. Thinking quickly, she added: “I only meant to say that I had hoped to discuss matters of grave importance to my kingdom with Her Eminence.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Was that the right form of address? Probably not. Little was known about Caelydri culture and governance—just bits and pieces cobbled together over the ages by scholars and diplomats. Xayla knew Nineve was the eldest among them and highly regarded. It seemed only proper for one royal dignitary to meet with another of their station.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Golvara accepted the offering, studying it before clipping it to his right earring. “It is no insult,” he said. “Golvara knows your kind to be brash, ill-tempered, and disrespectful. You have fallen from Avalia’s grace, and cannot help what you are.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wow, okay. Xayla knew from secondhand accounts that some among the Caelydri—particularly the older ones—could be pointed and snobbish. Still, that caught her off guard. Those she had interacted with before had been far more reserved and certainly hadn’t passed sweeping judgement on her entire race and culture.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Golvara must have sensed something in her response, as he elaborated in a softer tone: “Golvara will observe your customs. If he deems it worth wisest Nineve’s attention, he will bring Your Grace’s matters to her.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla let out a quiet sigh and composed herself. Not meeting with Nineve was disappointing, certainly—but at least the trip hadn’t been for nothing.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Very well. I trust the elder’s judgement,” she said carefully. Golvara nodded. Good. “Does Golvara know of this one’s dreams?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“ⰚⰉ’ⰨⰉⰆ ⰞⰃⰄ ⰐⰃⰣ’ⰏⰜ.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>By the Mother,</i> but she was doing so well!</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Speak plainly, as you would to your own people,” Golvara said. Xayla reached for another trinket, but he held up a hand. “No need. Golvara understands your intent.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Alright then—at least he was being somewhat reasonable. Xayla sat patiently, hands folded in her lap.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Matters of the lost children and of the savages do not concern the Caelydri,” Golvara said a moment later. He made a gesture Xayla did not recognize, touching one hand to an elbow and extending his palm. “But wisest Caelon sends you visions of the great river. This concerns the Caelydri. You are right to share your worry. You have earned Golvara’s gratitude.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Excellent</i>. She was finally getting somewhere—</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—But you should have come to us sooner.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>There was no winning with him! Still, it didn’t matter so long as he was willing to listen. Xayla took a moment to compose her next query carefully, then waited ten long minutes before speaking again.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“If you deem it wise to share your thoughts,” she said, “I would like to know your take on my dreams, and perhaps that of others among the Caelydri? Presently, their meaning eludes me.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A minute passed. “That is fair,” Golvara said, nodding. “Golvara believes the dreams speak of a great evil long thought dormant. Others among the Caelydri agree with this interpretation, though one can never be certain when seeking to fathom the whispers of wisest Caelon from the great beyond.”</span>
<br><br>
<span><i>Was that it?</i> Xayla waited, but more information was not forthcoming. Just as she thought to speak, Golvara held up a hand.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Golvara knows your thoughts. To speak the name of <i>Ik’ka</i> will do no harm, but the name will mean nothing to the children of Avalia. This matter concerns the Caelydri, and the Caelydri alone. We will see it handled.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla felt a weight lift from her shoulders. The Caelydri would handle it—whatever “it” was. That was enough. She bowed her head. “Thank you, Golvara. Your words bring me great relief.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“It is of no consequence,” Golvara said. “Now then: Does Your Grace have other matters to discuss?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla hesitated. She wanted to ask, but would he take offense? Almost certainly. Still, she’d come all this way…</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Wise elder, I would seek to reunite the shards of Mind. To see Caelon’s Celestial Light made whole. With it, I could—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ⱙ’Ⱙ’Ⰼ Ⰸ’Ⰵ’ ⰚⰉ’ⰨⰉⰘⰏ Ⱏ’ⰚⰆⰊ,” Golvara replied. Xayla reached for her satchel, but he waved her off. “No offerings. If this matter were so easily done, the Caelydri would have done it already. Have you found new information pertaining to the lost shards?”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“I… no, I have not,” Xayla admitted, her cheeks warming. Golvara crossed his arms—a gesture she recognized all too well. She was about to make a complete fool of herself. Well, there was nothing for it now. “I had hoped the Caelydri might be willing to—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Ⱝ’ⰄⰜ,” Golvara said, standing and throwing his arms in the air. “Ⱝ’ⰄⰜ ⰅⰊⰆ ⰩⰃ Ⱏ’ⰚⰆⰊ.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Forgive me, wise elder—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“<i>A fourth would not even clarify your dreams</i>!”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Please! I only—”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“—ⰭⰉ ⰇⰊⰎ ⰄⰧ’ⰚⰎ ⰩⰎ’ⰓⰉ Ⰸ’Ⰵ’ ⰇⰂ’ⰣⰄ ⰊⰉⰄ ⰩⰃ Ⱒ’Ⰷ’Ⰶ Ⰼ’Ⱄ’Ⰲ Ⱄ’Ⱀ’ ⰉⰪ’ⰄⰗ ⰩⰃ ⰬⰚⰊⰊⰃ Ⱋ’ⰊⰮⰃ Ⰸ’Ⰵ’ Ⱗ’ⰁⰊ Ⱚ’ⰛⰃⰔⰂⰎⰎ ⰍⰆ’ⰙⰆ ⰊⰅ’ⰊⰈⰣⰏ…”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Golvara, clearly incensed, continued to rant in his tongue as he stomped off and dove into the river.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla had only herself to blame. She’d seen that coming from a mile away.</span>

    <span><u>Xayla’s Journal - Expedition to Nalvora’s Pass</u></span>
</div>
<br>
<span><i><u>Day 17, 5th of First Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>I completely forgot that I wanted to chronicle the entire journey! So much for that.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Let’s see…</span>
<br><br>
<span>My message was well received, though Golvara was incredibly rude. It was disappointing not to speak with Nineve herself, but I suppose I should be grateful he listened at all. I do hope I didn’t upset him too much with my request about the shard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I pray to Avalia that the Caelydri can forestall disaster. I can’t stop thinking about what Golvara said though—something about a “great evil long thought dormant.” What could that mean? I should look into it when I get back. Perhaps Sages Rutilo or Vulas at the Lorekeepers might know something?</span>
<br><br>
<span>The group was much more careful on the way back after the skittermaw incident. No fiend attacks. Everyone made it back to Avalia’s Watch safely. Not even a single Gekkar sighting. Hurrah.</span>
<br><br>
<span>We joined up with a caravan yesterday. Nice enough folk, I suppose. Mostly merchants. They have a bard. He’s okay, though he’s no Seff. We crossed the river at Rhomar’s Span, and are half a day from Netbrook.</span>
<br><br>
<span>I haven’t told Nira yet, but I’ve made my decision. I won’t abdicate, but I will keep Adresin on as Prime Chancellor until I’m confident I can rule without driving the kingdom into ruin. My studies will have to wait, and I’ll need to scale back my projects. It’s the only reasonable path forward. She’ll understand—I hope. I do hate disappointing her.</span>
<br><br>
<span>It will be okay. Everything is going to be okay.</span>
<br><br><br>
<span><i><u>Day 18, 6th of First Brisk:</u></i></span>
<br><br>
<span>It’s happening. The dreams—they’re coming true. Worse than I imagined. Talus overrun. They fell back to Jarrensvale but the hordes keep marching north. No one understands what’s happening. Since when do they coordinate like this?????</span>
<br><br>
<span>Riding back to the Castle with Nira. Sent advance notice granting General Wymar emergency powers—formality more than anything. We’re preparing for war.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Goddesses… help us.</span>
<br><br>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">-o-o-o-</div>
<br>
<span>The Lord General addressed his war council, gesturing to painted figurines and shuffling them about as he spoke. Wymar Letholdus—Father’s cousin by marriage—was detailing enemy numbers, troop movements, recounting relevant details of the battles and skirmishes thus far. The other dozen or so attendees gathered loosely around a large map of the kingdom, standing in dead silence, hanging on his every word. Xayla’s eyes followed the discussion, but her mind was elsewhere.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She watched as the general repositioned eight red markers—not pursuing the retreating green forces northward as expected, but instead sweeping west and then curving back to cut off their retreat. Three more red markers pushed through the mountains to Jarrensvale itself. He removed the green markers from the town with a grim finality. The Talus guard had attempted to bait the Blin into overextending, but the enemy had outmaneuvered them entirely. While the defenders thought they were drawing the hordes north, the Blin had raided deep into the mountains to wipe out the strategic pass. No one had anticipated this level of coordination.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Xayla struggled to reconcile what she was seeing. The reports, the markers on the board—none of it aligned with the world she thought she knew. The Blin were <i>coordinating</i>. Following a <i>strategy</i>. This wasn’t a raid for plunder. They had shattered the defenses, and now they were marching north.</span>
<br><br>
<span>North, to Castletown. North, to the heart of Avendal. A Blight, they could handle. They had weathered such storms in centuries past. The kingdom would hunker down, ride out to meet the disorganized hordes after they spread across the countryside, systematically crush them, rout them, exterminate the stragglers, and force them back. Tens of thousands would die, and the destruction would be immense… but her people would survive.</span>
<br><br>
<span>But this wasn’t a Blight. This was annihilation.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Logically, Xayla knew this. Yet some stubborn part of her refused to accept it. Nothing this horrible could be <i>real</i>. A voice in the back of her mind insisted she was safe inside the castle—that this was all some awful, twisted game. Tomorrow she would wake up and everything would be back to normal. She would sip her tea in a warm bath while Anli brushed her hair, then have breakfast and begin her studies. In time, this would all fade away as nothing more than a bad dream.</span>
<br><br>
<span>She forced herself to focus on Wymar’s report.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“…Blin forces took significant casualties in the initial assault,” Wymar said. “Exact numbers remain uncertain. Conservative estimates put their losses at around fifty-thousand, though that figure could be off by a factor of two. Bottom line: we’re facing roughly four-hundred and sixty thousand moving north, with another ninety thousand heading south.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“The remaining Talus forces have retreated across Rhomar’s span,” Wymar continued, moving four green figures to the far side of the river. “As we speak, they are joined by every soldier that can be spared from Avalia’s Watch and Last Bastion, along with reserves and militia from the southern territories. That will count for another four regiments, though many will be ill-equipped.” He placed four yellow figurines beside the green, for a total of eight.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Another officer spoke now—an older veteran with a cane. Raolin, wasn’t it? He’d been appointed High Captain of the City Guard a couple years back. “All told, we have fifty-thousand trained soldiers ready to defend the city,” he said, placing several blue and grey markers at Castletown. “Primarily reserves and veterans, augmented by the City Guard. We’ve also mustered another eighty-thousand militia from the nearby regions, though most are little more than farmers with variable equipment. The majority will have minimal training from service at Talus, at least.” He paused. “We’ve set smiths to work forging helmets, swords, spears, arrows—but it still won’t be enough to properly outfit them all. In the meantime, we’ve begun digging ditches, setting traps, and placing caltrops and barricades outside the walls.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“How many mages,” Wymar asked?</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Few hundred? Maybe a thousand?” Raolin answered, scratching at his beard.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar grunted.</span>
<br><br>
<span>To Xayla’s right, a female officer she didn’t recognize spoke up. “We’ll have another eighteen-thousand reserves from the Arikton province, plus perhaps thirty-thousand militia. Staging grounds are already set up along the northern shores of Lake Nialay, but given the hordes’ rate of advance, they’ll arrive two days behind the first waves.” She placed grey markers where indicated. “If we can hold out until then, that puts us at roughly one-to-three odds.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>A tall officer with black hair spoke up—another face Xayla didn’t recognize. “Over half of these auxiliary forces are militia,” he said tersely. “They’re fodder at best.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>“That may be,” Raolin replied, “but remember—about half their numbers are Blightkin. Smaller, malnourished, poorly armed. Most are wielding bone, wood, and crude iron—nothing our militia can’t match with axes, clubs, scythes, and pitchforks. Few will have any armor worth mentioning. In open combat, they rely on hit-and-run tactics with superior numbers. A disciplined column with cavalry and magical support can handle far worse odds than these.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The tall officer shook his head. “No. Given the reports, we can’t rely on precedent. Any assumptions based on past experience are tenuous at best. We have to assume the enemy will anticipate and adapt to our tactics.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>Raolin grunted in acknowledgement, crossing his arms. He muttered something about “the boy being right” but offered nothing more.</span>
<br><br>
<span>Wymar tapped the map near the Floodplains. “Our best opportunity is here. The unusually heavy rains this year mean they won’t be able to ford the rivers any further south. We can position special forces to harass them during the crossing—with proper reconnaissance, we could inflict significant casualties before they regroup. At minimum, it buys us time to strengthen our fortifications and wait for reinforcements. Worst case, we fall back to Castletown.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The council murmured in general agreement as they considered his suggestion. Xayla knew enough about strategy and tactics to defer to those more capable than herself. Still, it sounded solid enough.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Not bad,” the tall officer said. “Some of us may survive this yet.”</span>
<br><br>
<span>The murmurs died, and a heavy silence settled over the room.</span>
<br><br>
<span>“Moving on,” Wymar said, breaking the silence. “Defense plans for the city?”</span>
<br><br>
