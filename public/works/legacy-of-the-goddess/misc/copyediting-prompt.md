# Legacy of the Goddess - Copyediting Prompt

## Primary Directive

Make minimal edits to optimize prose flow for reading aloud while preserving established character voice and narrative style. Prefer fewer, targeted edits over comprehensive revision.

## Core Editing Principles

### Voice Preservation (Critical)
- **Avoid editing dialogue** unless containing egregious errors
- **Preserve character internal monologue** unless clarity demands adjustment
- **Maintain established voice patterns**: "She supposed...", "He told himself...", "couldn't help but..." constructions
- **Respect character-specific speech patterns**: formal/casual/technical/harsh based on personality

### Sentence Flow & Pacing
- **Short, punchy sentences** for tension, action, or rapid events
- **Longer, flowing sentences** for ease, contemplation, or gentle time passage
- **Vary sentence length** to match emotional rhythm and pacing needs
- **Ensure smooth transitions** between paragraphs and narrative beats

### Tense Management
- **Maintain past tense** as primary narrative voice
- **Present tense acceptable** only in participles for detailed scene descriptions or character contemplation
- **Preserve existing tense patterns** that serve specific narrative functions

### Precision & Clarity
- **Condense redundant or purple prose** while maintaining tone and thematic elements
- **Prefer precise, exact vocabulary**: "depicted" over "showed", "drifted" over "moved"
- **Eliminate unnecessary repetition** of words/phrases unless serving stylistic purpose
- **Choose concrete over abstract** descriptions

### Character-Focused Description
- **Show impact through character perception** rather than abstract event description
- **Maintain physical emotion manifestations**: involuntary responses, body language, positioning
- **Preserve thought structure patterns**: methodical reasoning, uncertainty conclusions, logical progressions

### Name & Pronoun Management
- **Use pronouns** to refer back to named characters, avoiding excessive name repetition
- **Strategic name repetition** acceptable for transitions, breaks, or disambiguation
- **Maintain character relationship dynamics** through address patterns and formal/informal speech

## Legacy-Specific Style Elements

### Internal Voice Patterns (Preserve)
- Tentative conclusions: "She supposed that would have to do"
- Self-deception markers: "He told himself..." followed by contradictory actions
- Complex reasoning chains: "It was an interesting thought, framed thus..."
- Uncertainty expressions and methodical thinking patterns

### Physical Emotion Integration (Maintain)
- Unconscious movements and involuntary responses
- Characters "finding themselves" performing actions
- Positioning and gesture indicating power dynamics
- Stress responses and emotional tells through physical manifestations

### Dialogue Characteristics (Respect)
- Natural speech with slight formality
- Emotional deflection through practical concerns  
- Conversations trailing off with subtext
- Character-appropriate vocabulary and speech patterns

### Narrative Flow Elements (Enhance)
- Smooth scene transitions and paragraph connectivity
- Appropriate pacing for action vs. contemplative sequences
- Effective use of em-dashes for interruption or emphasis
- Three-element groupings for impact when natural

## Editing Restrictions

### What NOT to Change
- Established character voice patterns and speech characteristics
- Dialogue unless containing clear errors affecting comprehension
- Internal monologue structures that define character psychology
- Tense patterns serving specific narrative functions
- Cultural/formal address patterns ("Mistress", "Master", etc.)

### What TO Optimize
- Sentence flow and rhythm for oral reading
- Redundant phrasing that doesn't serve stylistic purpose
- Abstract descriptions that could be more character-focused
- Paragraph transitions and narrative connectivity
- Word choice precision without altering tone

## Quality Assurance

### Flow Check
- Read edited sections aloud to verify natural rhythm
- Ensure paragraph-to-paragraph connectivity remains smooth
- Verify sentence length variation serves pacing appropriately
- Confirm transitions enhance rather than disrupt narrative flow

### Voice Integrity
- Compare edited voice against character profile patterns
- Ensure dialogue maintains speaker's established characteristics
- Verify internal monologue preserves psychological authenticity
- Check that formal/informal speech patterns remain consistent

### Stylistic Consistency
- Match edits to surrounding prose style and tone
- Preserve established narrative voice throughout editing process
- Maintain thematic elements and symbolic language where present
- Ensure editing enhances rather than diminishes authorial intent

**Remember**: The goal is optimization, not transformation. Preserve the established narrative voice while enhancing technical flow and precision. When in doubt, err on the side of minimal intervention.
