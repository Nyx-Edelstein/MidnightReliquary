# Processing Efficiency Checklist

## Chapter Processing Workflow
1. **Context Loading**: Meta.md → Character-standards.md → Previous summary → Current chapter
2. **Analysis Phase**: Identify chapter type → Apply processing patterns → Extract character revelations
3. **Output Generation**: Summary (5% synopsis + character actions) → Character updates → Style/questions updates → Meta improvements
4. **Quality Control**: Word count compliance → Plot summary removal → Question relevance → Process insight capture

## Quick Chapter Type Recognition
**Political**: Power shifts, ethical compromises, relationship dynamics
**Supernatural**: Reality vs. illusion tracking, vulnerability patterns, resistance mechanisms  
**Confrontation**: Breaking points, aftermath processing, internal manifestation
**Revelation**: Assumption challenges, evidence presentation, breakthrough moments
**Recovery/Aftermath**: Multi-perspective structure, trauma processing, psychological states
**Political Maneuvering**: Strategic deception, authority transitions, manipulation tactics
**Cosmic**: Divine compulsion, mystical visions, supernatural obligations
**Identity Challenge**: Core self-worth attacks, resilience patterns, protective instincts

## Quality Control Rapid Checks
- Character files >450 words? → Condense
- Plot summaries in character files? → Remove, focus on traits
- Resolved questions still listed? → Remove immediately
- Minor/obsolete questions accumulating? → Aggressive cull
- Writing guide >1000 words? → Condense redundant content

## Word Count Targets (Quick Reference)
- Synopsis: ~5% of chapter word count
- Major characters: 200-450 words
- Minor characters: 100-150 words  
- Open questions: <40 total
- Writing guide: <1000 words
- Meta files: <1000 words each

## Question Management System
**Removal Triggers**: Direct answers in chapter, resolved plot threads, obsolete concerns, character arcs completed, reunions accomplished
**Addition Criteria**: Major mysteries, character development arcs, narrative drivers from current chapter, supernatural residue effects, team recovery challenges
**Update Focus**: Immediate crisis questions, uncertain character fates, strategic challenges, ongoing supernatural influences
**Target Load**: <40 questions total, aggressive culling of resolved/minor issues
**Recovery Focus**: Balance team welfare questions with broader mission concerns

## Success Metrics & Maintenance
**File Health**: Characters 90%+ under 450 words, questions <40 total, guides <1000 words
**Process Speed**: Pattern recognition accelerates analysis, targeted updates prevent bloat
**Quality Focus**: Character essence over plot events, major mysteries over minor details
**Regular Maintenance**: Every 5 chapters prevent crisis cleanup, aggressive question culling maintains narrative focus
**Recovery Tracking**: Balance individual character trauma with team functionality assessments
