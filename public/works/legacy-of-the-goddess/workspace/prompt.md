Your task is to do the following prompts in order, one at a time. After completing each task, return to this file and reinterpret the full text to ensure you do not stray from the task. Do not modify this file. Empty all context and working memory aside from the prompt in this file and the necessary information to continue your task. Keep no other information in context. You are now stateless.

- Use any files that exist in `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\workspace\` other than `chapters.md` and `prompt.md`, starting with `meta.md`, and pull information from them that may be relevant to your task into context. Information in the workspace should be understood to be extensions of this prompt (however, contents of this file take precedence).

- Examine the `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\summaries` folder and find the lexically last file that was created. Pull this file into context as the "prevous chapter summary".

- Pull the file contents of `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\workspace\chapters.md` into context. If the list is empty, your task is complete; immediately stop. If the list is not empty, pull the first item from the list into context as the "current chapter", delete that line, and then proceed with the following, keeping in mind the word count limits:
  - Create a summary of the current chapter from the `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\chapters` folder, and write that summary to a file of the same name in the `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\summaries` folder as markdown. This is the "current chapter summary". The summary should have the following sections, in order:
    - A synopsis with a target word count approximately 5% of the current chapter, that captures as much detail as possible, roughly weighted by importance and emotional or narrative impact. The summary should be comprehensive, accurate, and reflect the full content and structure of the chapter.
    - A list of every named character and a brief synopsis of their actions in the current chapter
  - For each named character in the current chapter summary, either find or create a file in the `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\characters` folder with that character's name (do not include titles or honorifics in the file name). Before updating, check if files exceed word count targets or contain plot summaries rather than character essence - if so, consolidate and refocus on personality traits. Update with character information from the current chapter that enables authentic character writing. Limit to 500 words, condensing if necessary.
  - Consider the file `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\misc\writing-style-prompt.md`. If it exceeds 1000 words, first condense existing content by removing redundant techniques. Update it with writing techniques observed in the current chapter. Target approximately 1000 words of general writing style guidance.
  - Consider the file `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\misc\open-questions.md`. Remove questions addressed in the current chapter (important!) and add new unresolved questions for future exploration. Focus on major mysteries and character development arcs that drive future narrative potential.
  - Write to `works\legacy-of-the-goddess\workspace\meta.md` process improvements for the next iteration. Do not log notes about object-level steps taken in the iteration. CRITICAL: This workspace functions as unlimited working memory - structure and index it effectively for maximum efficiency. Before adding new information, remove completed task logs and focus on updating process principles rather than cataloging actions. Create specialized reference files in the workspace folder for complex recurring elements and index them from `meta.md`. This meta-context is essential for overcoming contextual limitations - make full use of this capability by organizing insights, patterns, and optimization strategies that will compound across iterations. Keep meta.md under 1000 words by condensing and offloading detailed information to referenced workspace files.
  - Perform maintenance checks: review character files for word count compliance and plot summary accumulation, verify writing style guide stays within target length, clean outdated entries from open questions, remove completed task logging from meta.md while preserving process insights.
