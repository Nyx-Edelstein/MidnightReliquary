<h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
<span>Legacy of the Goddess is a rational-deconstruction take on the Legend of Zelda setting, explored in the format of a Quest. Among other things, this work aims to be:</span>
<br/>
<h4 style="margin: 25px 0px 5px 0px; font-weight: bold">Rational:</h4>
<span>Characters behave realistically and according to their motivations, not just because the plot, players, or QMs demand it. NPCs have agency, care about the world they inhabit, and will take action towards fulfilling their interests even where it conflicts with player intent. Magic behaves lawfully and has strict rules on what it can and cannot do.</span>
<br/><br/>
<span>It is important to note that no character is immune to consequence and anyone can die.</span>
<br/>
<h4 style="margin: 25px 0px 5px 0px; font-weight: bold">Simulationist:</h4>
<span>Events, contested outcomes, magic, character abilities, etc., are modeled with statistics, physics, custom software, and (hopefully) robust game systems. We aim to keep QM fiat rulings minimal in scope and scale, with as many things as possible being predictable and deterministic.</span>
<br/>
<h4 style="margin: 25px 0px 5px 0px; font-weight: bold">Deconstruction:</h4>
<span>Canon story elements, tropes, and other material are used only as inspiration to reverse engineer a setting where these ideas are taken seriously and pushed to their logical conclusions. This has involved substantial world-building, crafting of fictional histories, etc.</span>
<br/><br/>
<span>First and foremost, this work aims to be as internally and logically consistent as possible while still remaining true to the source material.</span>
