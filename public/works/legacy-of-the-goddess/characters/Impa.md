# Impa

**Core Identity**: A Sheikah warrior serving as Princess Zelda's guardian, protector, and moral conscience. Impa embodies the dark protector archetype—someone who will embrace monstrous transformation and commit terrible acts to defend what she holds sacred. She operates in moral shadows that others prefer to ignore.

**Personality**: Brutally honest and uncompromising in her duty. Possesses cold, calculating intelligence paired with intense protective rage. Finds satisfaction in violence against those who threaten her charges, showing sadistic pleasure when eliminating enemies. Maintains emotional distance except when dealing with betrayal by those she trusted.

**Speaking Style**: Direct and harsh, uses intimidation and cutting remarks to maintain control. Speaks truth regardless of consequences or feelings. Military precision in communication. Shows vulnerability only when discussing personal betrayals or divine matters.

**Combat & Abilities**: Formidable red magic user capable of draconic transformation—scales, claws, fangs, and spines erupting from her body. Enhanced strength and reflexes beyond natural limits. Expert in intelligence gathering and covert operations. Trained at abandoned Sheikah facilities with harsh upbringing.

**Motivations**: Absolute loyalty to Princess Zelda and the Sheikah code overrides all personal considerations. Will undertake any mission, face any danger, or make any sacrifice to protect those she serves. Views herself as a tool forged for the kingdom's service.

**Methods**: Operates secret underground facilities for interrogation and experimentation. Systematically eliminates threats through torture and murder when necessary. Maintains extensive intelligence networks throughout the court and beyond. Constructs elaborate security protocols.

**Relationships**: Follows strict hierarchy under Sheikah leader Vian. Maintains professional distance while serving as Zelda's harsh counselor. Deeply affected by betrayal from mentor figures. Refuses to be overruled by royal authority when she believes her charges are in danger.

**Internal Conflicts**: Struggles with emotional devastation when trusted mentors betray the cause. Balances personal grief against professional duty. Must reconcile her willingness to become monstrous with her role as moral guardian for others.
