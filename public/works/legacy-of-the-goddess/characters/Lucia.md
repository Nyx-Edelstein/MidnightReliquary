## Core Identity
Void-born Fae entity created from the metaphysical emptiness left by Queen Cordatia's murdered family, appearing identical to Niesis with silver hair and vine-covered form.

## Personality
Demonstrates extraordinary restraint and self-discipline, preferring death to corruption while maintaining alliance commitments. Shows remarkable transparency about her nature and limitations, voluntarily wearing symbolic shackles to represent power restraint. Exhibits ancient wisdom tempered by acknowledgment of knowledge gaps about the modern world.

## Speaking Style
Speaks with measured precision and transparency, answering questions directly while carefully avoiding dangerous subjects. Uses gentle corrections and warnings, explaining complex supernatural concepts with patient clarity. Shows respect for mortal limitations while maintaining divine perspective.

## Abilities/Skills
Possesses tremendous Fae powers over hearts, minds, and essence of mortals, but exercises extreme restraint to prevent self-corruption. Can manifest environmental manipulation and divine light but avoids using personal power except when absolutely necessary. Operates through coinhabitance with Shesan and focuses through jade pendant artifacts. Bound by three-question compulsion rule requiring direct answers.

## Motivations
Seeks to avert calamity as she did during the Reaffirmation, maintaining alliance with Hylia's bloodline. Prioritizes preservation of her uncorrupted nature over power usage, preferring limitations to becoming like other Fae. Committed to supporting Zelda's fragment bonding transformation for enhanced communication capabilities.

## Relationships
Maintains voluntary coinhabitance with Shesan based on mutual trust and shared objectives. Treats Zelda as equal despite vast power differential, respecting her as Queen Cordatia's reincarnation and Blood of Hylia. Shows protective stance toward alliance while acknowledging potential future corruption risks.

## Internal Conflicts
Balances tremendous power with self-imposed limitations to prevent corruption. Struggles with knowledge she cannot safely share until Zelda's spiritual transformation. Weighs alliance benefits against risks of using abilities that gradually corrupt Fae nature.

## Methods/Approach
Employs symbolic communication and dimensional travel through Shesan's abilities rather than personal power. Uses jade pendant focuses to minimize direct power expenditure while maintaining influence capabilities. Plans to reveal critical information after Zelda's fragment bonding enables safer concept communication.
