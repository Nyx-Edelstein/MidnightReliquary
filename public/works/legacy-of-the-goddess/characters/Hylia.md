# Hylia

**Core Identity**: The fallen goddess who serves as divine narrator and ultimate maternal figure. Once the grand culmination of divine power, now exists as fractured fragments in the Void, desperately reaching across dimensions to protect her "children" in Hyrule.

**Personality**: Carries profound divine tragedy mixed with urgent maternal desperation. Embodies both supreme authority and heartbreaking vulnerability. Speaks with prophetic weight while pleading for her people's salvation. Shows deep regret and protective love that transcends divine nature.

**Original Nature**: Engineered by Nayru as an incorruptible masterpiece capable of wielding combined divine power without destruction. Designed to be the perfect guardian and steward. Her downfall came through the very virtues she embodied—trust and love—when she witnessed a red-haired champion's heroic sacrifice.

**Current State**: Exists as mere fragments scattered across the Void, unable to directly intervene. Possesses only enough power for one final blessing to a chosen champion. Forced to present agonizing choices between worthy candidates while unable to help them all. Can manifest in Sacred Realm visions as a majestic figure in pure white robes, but these interactions appear to be pre-recorded divine messages rather than genuine real-time communication. Shows divine sadness when unable to respond directly to urgent pleas from her champions.

**Speaking Style**: Prophetic cadence with divine authority, but tinged with regret and maternal pleading. Repeatedly urges "take heed and listen" to emphasize critical importance. Addresses her people as "children" with deep personal affection. In Sacred Realm visions, delivers formal commendations and quest charges with predetermined responses that cannot adapt to immediate circumstances or urgent questions.

**Relationships**: Deeply personal and protective toward all Hyrule's people, especially the royal bloodline carrying her essence. Refers to Zelda as "my own blood" and shows maternal desperation for their protection. Maintains divine perspective while expressing very human emotions.

**Motivation**: Desperate to prevent the ancient evil that destroyed her from consuming everything she holds dear. Willing to sacrifice her remaining existence to give her champions a chance at victory she could not achieve.
