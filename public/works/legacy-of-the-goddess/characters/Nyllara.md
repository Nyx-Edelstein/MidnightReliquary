# Nyllara (Chancellor Nyllara Zan, Queen's Law)

**Core Identity**: Queen's Law responsible for maintaining written law, adjudicating disputes, and administering court proceedings. Represents institutional legal authority and governmental continuity during crisis periods and leadership transitions.

**Legal Authority**: Holds responsibility for criminal guilt determination, civil dispute adjudication, and delegating responsibilities to magistrates throughout the kingdom. Possesses backup judicial authority to administer court when monarch is unavailable.

**Professional Conduct**: Demonstrates proper political protocol and institutional respect for royal authority. Shows understanding of Council dynamics by deferring appropriately when offering professional concerns that conflict with royal prerogative.

**Current Role**: Oversees reconstruction efforts requiring coordination of massive logistical challenges including infrastructure repair, resource allocation, and population resettlement. Her absence from regular proceedings demonstrates scale of post-siege reconstruction challenges.

**Institutional Function**: Provides legal continuity during transition from King Gaillard's reign to Queen Zelda's rule. Balances traditional legal precedent with emergency measures necessitated by war and aftermath while ensuring legal systems continue functioning.

**Collaborative Approach**: Coordinates with Chancellor Adresin (Queen's Justice) in division of legal authorityâ€”focuses on interpretation and adjudication while Adresin handles enforcement and punishment. This system provides checks and balances with comprehensive judicial coverage.

**Expertise**: Legal interpretation skills provide foundation for establishing new procedures and protocols necessitated by kingdom's changed circumstances. Intersection of legal authority with practical governance enables effective rebuilding frameworks for property rights and administrative coordination.
