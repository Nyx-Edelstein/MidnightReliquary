# Niesis

**Core Identity**: An imprisoned Fae entity who willingly submitted to imprisonment after helping the Seekers seal away other dangerous Fae. Represents the complex moral ambiguity of supernatural beings who can be both helpful and potentially threatening.

**Appearance**: Described as the most beautiful creature ever seen, appearing as a young woman suspended in divine light with skin radiating a soft white glow. Her ethereal beauty suggests otherworldly nature while maintaining recognizably feminine form.

**Historical Role**: Created the original sealing scepter used by the Seekers to imprison Fae entities and instructed them in its use. Actively assisted in locating other Fae before voluntarily submitting to imprisonment herself, suggesting either sacrifice or unknown compulsion.

**Moral Complexity**: Unlike malicious Fae such as Cyrae, Niesis aided humans in containing supernatural threats. Her willing imprisonment raises questions about whether she was protecting others from herself, responding to external pressure, or accepting responsibility for collective Fae dangers.

**Current Status**: Recently escaped from magical imprisonment when Zelda's attempt to temporarily release her caused the ancient scepter to catastrophically fail. Her current intentions, location, and capabilities remain unknown, creating potential security threat.

**Imprisonment Motivation**: The reason for her willing submission remains mysterious. Possible explanations include recognition of inherent danger posed by Fae existence, external threats requiring containment, or human prejudice against all supernatural entities regardless of individual behavior.

**Abilities/Threat Level**: As a Fae entity, presumably possesses significant supernatural abilities comparable to Cyrae's manipulation powers. Her specific capabilities and whether she retains benevolent intentions after centuries of imprisonment are unknown factors requiring careful assessment.

**Intelligence Value**: Potentially possesses invaluable historical knowledge about ancient magical conflicts, Fae entities, divine artifacts, and suppressed events from before the era of human dominance. Could provide crucial information about cosmic threats and magical solutions.
