# Lensa (Countess Lensa)

**Core Identity**: Queen Zelda's former tutor and key council advisor who serves as surrogate maternal figure and practical political mentor. Embodies institutional knowledge and fierce protection of royal dignity while bridging old political order with new reign.

**Personality**: Sharp strategic thinking combined with maternal protectiveness. Shows genuine concern for crown's reputation and political stability. Willing to provide sharp but necessary criticism when royal responsibilities are neglected. Takes initiative in practical matters and offers personal resources to support the crown. Under extreme stress, becomes paranoid and erratic, making increasingly wild accusations. When pushed beyond her limits, loses composure entirely and becomes hysterical, resorting to calling Zelda a "naive fool" and questioning her competence. After crossing line with disrespectful treatment, immediately recognizes her mistake and becomes abjectly apologetic. Genuinely believes she was magically influenced during her breakdown, according to Fi's analysis, suggesting either magical manipulation or psychological break under pressure.

**Political Philosophy**: Prioritizes political stability over personal security, understanding how leadership symbols affect public confidence. Believes monarchy's primary function is stability through clear succession and decisive leadership rather than perfect decision-making.

**Mentorship Style**: Uses deliberate provocation to test royal authority, including patronizing behavior and direct contradiction to force Zelda to assert leadership. Provides strategic analysis of political missteps, explaining how threats and ultimatums can backfire politically. Teaches through tough love, creating situations where proper authority must be demonstrated rather than assumed.

**Speaking Style**: Direct and sharp when addressing lapses in royal responsibility. Uses frank discussion about sensitive topics like romantic relationships and succession planning. Demands order during chaotic situations with authoritative voice.

**Relationship with Zelda**: Shows complex dynamic of critic and supporter, providing both harsh criticism and practical assistance. Continues efforts to refine social graces through family gatherings while managing noble society expectations. Relationship reaches crisis point when Lensa's paranoia about Taetus leads to frantic accusations and disrespectful treatment. Fundamentally cannot overcome viewing Zelda as her father's child rather than queen in her own right. After physical confrontation, becomes desperate to maintain relationship but trust is severely damaged.

**Council Role**: Serves as counterbalance to opportunistic advisors, offering advice based on genuine kingdom welfare rather than personal advancement. Provides stabilizing force during court proceedings and political discussions.

**Resource Management**: Willing to share personal household staff and resources to ensure proper royal support. Demonstrates personal investment in Queen's success through practical assistance and protective instincts. Manages complex social networks including family obligations while supporting the crown.
