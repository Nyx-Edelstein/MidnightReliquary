# Marlas (Count Marlas of House Nen)

**Core Identity**: A noble lord who represents traditional aristocratic resistance to emergency authoritarian measures. His public flogging by Prime Counselor Taetus serves as a symbolic confrontation between established noble privilege and crisis-driven administrative authority.

**Political Position**: Refused to acknowledge Crown authority as implemented through Taetus's harsh redistribution policies, representing broader noble opposition to forced wealth confiscation and emergency measures that bypass traditional channels of consent.

**Significance**: His punishment—public flogging for defying Crown authority—demonstrates the violent lengths to which Taetus will go to enforce compliance with emergency policies. Represents the broader tension between maintaining noble cooperation and implementing necessary crisis management.

**Symbolic Role**: Embodies the collision between traditional feudal relationships and emergency governance. His treatment by Taetus creates precedent for violent enforcement of royal directives against noble resistance, potentially destabilizing the entire feudal system that depends on mutual respect and voluntary cooperation.
