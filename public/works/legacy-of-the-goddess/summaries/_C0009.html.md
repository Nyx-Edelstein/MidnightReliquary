# Chapter 9 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 9 takes place during the royal party's travel from the temple toward Last Bastion, camping between Lake Hylia and the surrounding woods. Link leads a scouting party with Cove and Burdah to canvas the area for threats, though he acknowledges this level of precaution is excessive given their extensive guard force of six Sheikah and twenty-six guardsmen. During their return to camp, they encounter a young kodongo (large lizard-like creature) which they successfully dispatch through coordinated teamwork—Link's sword thrust to the neck, Cove's red magic energy attack to the chest, and Burdah's spear through the temple.

However, the dead kodongo's parent—a massive adult—emerges to attack the unarmed Burdah. In a moment of desperate need, Link experiences his first conscious use of Lightsworn abilities, intuitively accessing Red magic to enhance his speed through what he describes as his magic "answering" his need. He charges forward at supernatural speed and decapitates the giant kodongo in a single strike, saving Burdah but leaving himself exhausted and dizzy from the magical exertion. This event confirms his successful transformation into a Lightsworn following the ritual from the previous chapter.

Back at camp, Cove enthusiastically recounts the heroic deed to the assembled soldiers, who celebrate Link as both "Hero of Castletown" and "Queen's Champion" despite his obvious discomfort with the attention. Zelda intervenes to give Link space, then engages him in a private conversation to understand his newfound abilities. Link explains that he doesn't understand how the magic worked—it simply responded when he desperately needed to reach Burdah faster, giving him exactly what the situation required without conscious training or effort.

Their discussion reveals Link's intuitive mastery, as he demonstrated combat-level Red magic proficiency on his first attempt, something that typically requires years of training. Zelda proposes structured magical training with herself teaching Blue magic, Grenja handling Red magic instruction, and Koja reinforcing Green magic fundamentals. She emphasizes the strategic importance of having a combat-capable mage with all magical affinities. The conversation shifts to more personal territory when Zelda attempts to understand Link's psychological motivations, recognizing his extreme self-sacrifice and dedication to service as potentially stemming from unresolved trauma.

When she directly asks about what led him to enlist at Talus, Link immediately shuts down and attempts to leave. Zelda uses her Blue magic to send a soothing pulse, helping him relax enough to promise they might discuss it "another time" while maintaining his boundaries about not wanting to talk currently. The chapter ends with Zelda reflecting on Link's buried darkness and her determination to care for someone who consistently prioritizes others over himself, wondering whether her probing will lead to progress or disaster.
