# Chapter 5 Summary

## Synopsis
Chapter 5 focuses on Zelda's continued interrogation of the Sheikah prisoners, a pivotal meeting with High Priestess Vestele that reveals crucial information about Hylia's death and the existence of Fae, and culminates in an assassination attempt during a public address. The chapter explores themes of truth, deception, divine power, and the dangerous political climate Zelda must navigate.

The chapter opens with Zelda conducting tedious interrogations of captured Sheikah, using Fi's abilities to detect truthfulness. Her frustration mounts as she encounters everything from straightforward cooperation to manipulative attempts at ingratiation. She completes her assessment, categorizing the prisoners as "clear," "maybe clear," or requiring further questioning, and presents her findings to General Wymar despite his skepticism about her clearance of two individuals he deemed disloyal.

A seemingly innocent card game scene between Zelda and Link provides character development and relationship dynamics before the narrative shifts to Zelda's crucial meeting with High Priestess Vestele at the Temple of Hylia. This meeting becomes the chapter's centerpiece, revealing that Vestele knows about Fi and has been aware that Hylia died ages ago. The priestess explains the dangerous truth about Faeâ€”malevolent fragments of Hylia's essence that feed on human souls and have historically manipulated people into horrific actions. She recounts the tale of General Arminel, whose sixty-year losing war was actually orchestrated by a Fae named Cyrae, and explains how the Seekers were originally founded to find and contain these entities.

The chapter concludes with Zelda and Vestele attempting a public address to unite the Crown and Faith, but it's interrupted by an assassination attempt involving explosives. Zelda is knocked unconscious and dragged to safety while chaos erupts around the makeshift podium.
