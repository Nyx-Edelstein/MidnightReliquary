# Chapter 20 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 20 presents a pivotal political crisis that fundamentally reshapes the kingdom's power structure while revealing the escalating strain on Zelda's leadership. The chapter opens with Zelda enjoying a rare moment of comfort at Dunwich, planning her return to royal duties and strategizing about the Fae, when Countess Lensa arrives in a frantic state. Lensa accuses Prime Counselor Taetus of orchestrating a systematic usurpation of the throne, claiming he has suspended council meetings, established his own spy network, replaced the city guard with loyalists, and granted his supporters unchecked authority over their districts. Her accusations become increasingly erratic, suggesting Taetus has intercepted her communications and is conspiring with Chancellor Nyllara to make himself king.

The confrontation escalates dramatically when Lensa becomes hysterical, repeatedly calling Zelda a "naive fool" and claiming she's been bewitched by Shesan. When Lensa crosses the line by suggesting Zelda is "selling out your father's kingdom," Zelda strikes her across the face. The violence shocks everyone, including Zelda herself, who realizes that Lensa will never see her as anything more than her father's child. Fi reveals that Lensa genuinely believes she was under a witch's spell, adding another layer of confusion to the situation. Rather than removing Lensa from office entirely, Zelda sends her away to tend to her estate, showing both mercy and political calculation.

The political thread continues when Zelda returns to Castletown, where she immediately notices troubling changes—young, inexperienced guards wearing non-standard uniforms who address Taetus as "Lord Councilor." Her confrontation with Taetus takes place in the throne room, where she's shocked to find Shesan already present. Taetus defends his actions as necessary measures to maintain order, revealing genuine anger at Zelda's accusations. Fi confirms his sincerity about having no treasonous designs, but also detects that he's withholding important information.

The chapter's climax comes when Shesan proposes her shocking solution: Zelda should marry Taetus as her King Consort. This arrangement would grant Taetus legitimate authority while freeing Zelda to focus on the supernatural threats. Shesan argues this is the only politically viable solution that wouldn't trigger civil war or noble rebellion. Despite her visceral disgust at the idea, Zelda recognizes the political logic—Taetus needs legitimacy that only royal marriage can provide, and she needs someone competent to manage the kingdom while she deals with Demise's threat. The chapter ends with Zelda literally vomiting at the implications of this political necessity.

Meanwhile, Link's team experiments with the ancient stone tablet, discovering it can detect artifacts at different power levels. When charged with sufficient Divine Power, the tablet reveals directional indicators—blue light pointing to Ryn (as a marked individual) and red light pointing toward the haunted mountain pass, confirming their destination contains something significant. The discovery that different colored lights indicate different types of detectable objects suggests the tablet is more sophisticated than initially understood.

The chapter also features Fi marking Koja with minimal Divine Power to expand the team's magical capabilities, demonstrating the ongoing development of their supernatural resources. The team's preparation for approaching Ibboso's haunted domain includes strategic discussions about whether they'll need to fight or negotiate with the spirits, with Ryn suggesting a diplomatic approach based on Hylia's guidance.
