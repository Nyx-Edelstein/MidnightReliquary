# Chapter 25 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 25 opens with Link alone in the desert, wrestling with exhaustion, physical pain from his injured right arm, and profound existential doubt. His identity as a warrior and protector feels stripped away by his disability, leaving him questioning whether he's truly the chosen hero or merely following echoes of an ancient mission. A mysterious voice whispers "So do it anyway," which Link tentatively attributes to Fi, though she remains absent from his consciousness.

The narrative shifts to reveal the team's shared trauma from their encounter with Ibboso's illusions. While Link dozed, his companions tracked him down, leading to a violent confrontation when Grenja attacks him, believing he's still possessed by Ibboso. After establishing his identity, Link debriefs the team about their collective experiences with the supernatural village and his encounter with Seff. The siblings are clearly traumatized, with Grenja in particularly poor psychological condition.

The chapter explores the aftermath of trauma through intimate character moments. Ryn experiences disturbing dreams about reflections and drowning, while Koja suffers nightmares that wake the camp. Grenja reveals the depth of his psychological wounds during a scouting mission with Ryn, describing his encounter with trapped souls of children who died during an ancient attack. His guilt manifests physically through self-harm, having lost three and a half fingers attempting to help these phantom children.

The team's dynamic shifts toward protective caution as they recognize everyone needs recovery time. Link's disconnect from Fi compounds their strategic challenges, making him question their ability to continue their mission. The chapter concludes with an ominous note as Ryn discovers a mysterious jade pendant that cannot reflect her image, suggesting lingering supernatural influence from their recent encounters.
