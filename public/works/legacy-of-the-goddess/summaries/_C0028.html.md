# Chapter 28 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 28 presents a multi-perspective aftermath chapter focusing on recovery and ongoing challenges across different character arcs. The chapter opens with Link experiencing a disturbing dream about driving a merchant wagon with his father Karindal while traveling in a caravan from Hateno to Kakariko. In the dream, his father nearly calls him "Arlinkar" before correcting to "Link," showing Link's preference for the shortened name. The peaceful driving lesson becomes nightmarish when a Kargarok attacks, mirroring Link's current trauma. When a real Kargarok attacks their caravan, Link's injured arm prevents him from responding effectively, leaving him feeling useless as Ryn efficiently destroys the creature with her transfabrulator. This triggers Link's deepening frustration with his disability and heroic inadequacy, leading to emotional tension with Ryn who attempts to provide support and perspective. Their argument reveals Link's struggle with expectations of heroism versus his current limitations, culminating in Ryn forcing him to accompany her on a private scouting ride to address his psychological state.

Meanwhile, Queen Zelda meets with Goron emissary Kenak outside Castletown's gates, learning crucial information about fulfilling the blood oath to restore relations with the Goron tribes. She discovers she must hunt down descendants of Kiat the Warmonger—the lynel who killed Chief Bhurdon—and recover the Chieftain's Hammer. Kenak reveals vital intelligence about the Eye of Din, a volcanic temple far to the southeast, and confirms that Sage Asdrum the Ancient maintains a portal at Death Mountain's heart, though it has been broken following a dispute with the Chief. Zelda realizes this connects to their broader mission to locate Lightsworn temples and arranges to send envoys with Kenak.

The chapter's middle section shows Zelda navigating complex political and social maneuvering as she attempts to recruit Naibi of the Sunseekers for the diplomatic mission to Goron lands. After struggling with appropriate venues and protocols, Zelda ultimately chooses to meet at the Winged Shield tavern, creating an informal atmosphere that allows for honest conversation. However, Naibi first reveals that they discovered and executed two of Ganondorf's spies among the Sunseekers, adding another layer of security concerns. Despite being somewhat impaired by alcohol, Zelda successfully recruits Naibi for the mission by emphasizing cultural healing, strategic positioning, and mutual benefit.

The chapter concludes with Chancellor Taetus reluctantly beginning combat training with Master-at-arms Oboe at Queen Zelda's request, designed to explore potential abilities granted by his Power fragment. During training, Taetus demonstrates his previously secret Red magic affinity through advanced Invigorate techniques, showing promise but requiring significant development. Simultaneously, Taetus engages in political maneuvering by deliberately spreading rumors about the Lightsworn restoration and Link's divine blessing while conducting city business, using public spaces to control information flow. The chapter ends with Taetus recovering from training while discussing ongoing political complications with Nyllara, including Countess Lensa's successful maneuvering with House Lotan that threatens his influence network.
