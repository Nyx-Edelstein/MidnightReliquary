# Chapter 10 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 10 follows the royal party as they travel toward Kakariko Village, focusing on Link's intensive magical training under Zelda's guidance. The chapter opens with Link struggling to master Blue magic telepathy despite his frustration and sleep deprivation from the previous night. Zelda patiently explains the fundamental differences between magical affinities—describing Green magic as "drawing up" energy, Red magic as internal ignition, and Blue magic as "summoning" or projecting with absolute expectation. Through her ice crystal demonstration and careful instruction, Link finally succeeds in telepathic communication, though he quickly learns the significant magical cost limits its tactical applications.

The training continues with mixed results across Blue magic abilities. Link finds Scrying physically debilitating, causing severe vertigo, headaches, and repeated falls from his oxgoat, making him question its practical value given the extensive training requirements. Foretelling proves more manageable—he masters calling coin flips mid-air though struggles with prediction before the toss. Meanwhile, his telepathy range extends to several dozen meters with clear visualization, though longer distances remain unreliable.

Grenja's Red magic combat training reveals Link's natural aptitude for augmented fighting. Despite Grenja's superior baseline speed and strength, Link demonstrates remarkable instinctive control of Invigorate, matching the experienced warrior's enhanced movements until making a tactical error that costs him the duel. Grenja enthusiastically praises Link's supernatural sword work against the kodongo, advising him to focus on weapon-enhanced combat over fancy techniques while firmly warning against practicing Transformation magic without proper supervision. Link also easily masters Siphon magic, drawing magical energy from Grenja through physical contact.

Parallel to Link's training, Zelda undergoes her own martial instruction with Captain Izu and guardsman Oboe, struggling with spear combat fundamentals. Despite repeated defeats and physical bruising, she demonstrates growing tactical thinking when she improvises by throwing her weapon to escape an impossible position—earning praise for creative problem-solving and learning that survival often requires abandoning conventional form for practical solutions.

The chapter culminates with the party's arrival at Last Bastion, where Zelda finally meets Naibi, First of the Sunseekers, who has been waiting almost a week. Their initial interaction is tense, with Naibi displaying open hostility toward what she perceives as disrespectful treatment. However, Zelda's diplomatic approach—acknowledging the mutual history between their peoples while emphasizing Hyrule's desperate need for allies—successfully defuses the situation. The conversation takes an ominous turn when Naibi speaks of a "coming conflict" involving forces capable of defeating a Goddess, revealing that Hylia's death was part of a larger cosmic struggle. The chapter ends with Naibi's urgent demand that Zelda accompany her to meet the Lynx, warning that "the fate of the world hangs in the balance" and time may be running out.
