## Synopsis

The chapter opens with Zelda's desperate prayer to Hylia being answered as she is chosen as the goddess's champion. Divine power floods through her, restoring her magic and causing her skin to glow with golden aura. She effortlessly destroys the assassins with crystalline spikes, demonstrating limitless magical ability. The floating, ethereal emissary Fi appears, revealing herself as Hylia's messenger sent to provide guidance on Zelda's quest.

Fi delivers Hylia's command: rally the armies, go to the northwest gate to aid a specific soldier, and bring the fight to the enemy. Zelda attempts unconventional transportation methods, using water magic to propel herself through a window and across the castle grounds, arriving soaked but uninjured before the assembled troops. She announces her divine appointment to General Wymar and tasks him with rallying the forces while she completes her mission.

At the northwest gate, Zelda discovers horrific carnage and witnesses Link fighting desperately against massive Blin opponents while surrounded by a chanting horde. When Link is overwhelmed and savagely attacked, Zelda unleashes divine wrath, raining fire and ice spikes down on the enemy in a devastating display of power. She rescues Link, who is dying from bloodrage-infected wounds that resist normal healing magic.

Fi advises that Zelda's enhanced abilities can heal spiritual wounds like bloodrage. Through alternating between healing magic and soothing enchantments drawn from peaceful memories, Zelda successfully saves Link's life, singing to him as she works. The effort exhausts her divine power, and she collapses unconscious for three days.

Zelda awakens to learn the siege has been broken but at terrible costâ€”400,000 deaths, with major cities destroyed and only fragments of the army remaining. She discovers that during her unconsciousness, her divine-enhanced form led the army to initial victory before the power faded, allowing enemy forces to rally and cause massive casualties. One Warlord was killed, but others remain active with 100,000-200,000 Blin forces still at large.

Most devastatingly, Zelda learns of personal losses during her absence: her father King Gaillard has died from an attack by Vesyrn's rogue Sheikah faction, and Impa died attempting to protect him. The Sheikah organization is in complete disarray with Vian dead, Allanah missing, and remaining members detained under suspicion. Vesyrn escaped with the stolen Wisdom fragments to unknown ends.

The chapter concludes one week later with Zelda's coronation as Queen of Hyrule, though she struggles with anger and regret over Hylia's choice to save Link rather than those closer to her. In her private study afterward, she contemplates the overwhelming challenges facing her kingdom: remaining Blin forces, multiple Warlords, mysterious figures like "the Lynx" and the "Exiled King," her unresolved prophetic visions, and her role as the new ruler. The chapter ends with Link arriving for their first formal meeting, both of them bearing the physical and emotional scars of their ordeal.
