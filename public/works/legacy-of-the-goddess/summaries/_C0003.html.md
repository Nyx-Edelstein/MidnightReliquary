## Synopsis

The chapter opens with Link recounting the loss of his Uncle Raolin during the siege, revealing that the Warlord seemed to recognize Raolin and let him through the enemy lines before ultimately killing him. Zelda attempts to recruit Link as her personal champion, initially meeting resistance as he prioritizes returning to battle to help those still fighting. She manipulates him emotionally by revealing her vulnerability, sharing her grief over Impa's death and her fears about ongoing assassination threats.

Fi suddenly manifests, startling both Link and the guards. Through Fi, Zelda learns devastating news: Hylia has died, having expended all her power empowering Zelda and fighting the Blin invasion. Fi reveals that both Zelda and Link are divinely chosen championsâ€”Zelda bears Nayru's favor and fragments of Wisdom, while Link bears Farore's favor and fragments of Courage. Fi explains her own abilities, including telepathy, converting Divine Power to magic, manifestation, and mind-suggestion, though her power is limited and tied to heroic actions by those bearing Hylia's mark.

After extensive discussion about divine mechanics and research into legendary artifacts, Link accepts the position as Queen's Champion, motivated by the opportunity to investigate Vesyrn and the assassins. However, Zelda orders him to rest for several more days given his poor physical condition.

The chapter shifts to Zelda conducting research on legendary magical artifacts, compiling detailed notes on items ranging from the Minish Cap to the Master Sword. She falls asleep while researching and awakens late for court, earning rebuke from Countess Lensa for her irresponsibility.

During court proceedings, Zelda deals with various petitioners including refugees, merchants seeking tax relief, farmers requesting magical aid for their crops, and criminal cases. A wounded soldier publicly challenges her about when she will join the fighting, creating an uproar that forces Lensa to adjourn the session.

In a private council meeting, General Wymar requests permission to deploy the remaining untested Sheikah and half the Royal Guard to the front lines, suggesting Zelda retreat to Kakariko for safety. Countess Lensa objects, arguing that the Queen abandoning the capital would be catastrophic for morale. Counselor Taetus opportunistically requests temporary administrative powers while other officials are away.

The chapter concludes with Taetus delivering a message from a Gerudo rider. "The Lynx" offers aid from the Sunseekers, requesting a reply sent via a rider on a white horse. Zelda recognizes the significance but remains cautious about revealing what she knows to the council, ending the chapter with her retiring to consider the mounting pressures and difficult decisions facing her reign.
