# Chapter 29 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 29 presents a multi-perspective recovery chapter focusing on intelligence gathering, strategic developments, and character reconnections. The chapter opens with Zelda observing Malg's sophisticated interrogation of a captured Yiga spy named Dranderval, disguised as a guardsman alongside Laylith. Malg employs psychological manipulation rather than torture, creating a comfortable environment to unsettle the prisoner before revealing false intelligence about Hylian advantages and fragment locations. When the interrogation turns to actual torture, Zelda is forced to leave but gains crucial information about Ganondorf's spy network—the Yiga Clan—which has been operating for twenty years as zealots believing in world conquest under their leader.

Meanwhile, Shesan brings Zelda positive news about Vesyrn and Allanah's mission to Byrna, where they successfully recovered two fragments of Wisdom despite heavy losses. The team encountered a secret order of warrior monks who had been tracking them and led them into an ambush. Though the Sheikah won the battle, killing over a dozen monks including two leaders, they lost half their team and had to retreat with captives to ensure safe passage. This brings their total to six Wisdom fragments but creates potential enemies of the surviving monks.

Zelda records disturbing dreams in her journal: one of following a growing remlit that transforms into a roaring lynel in the market square, and another of flying as a bird-like creature through rings toward the Eye of Din, suggesting possible locations of additional fragments or races. The chapter emphasizes Zelda's growing burden of leadership and the mounting complexities of their strategic situation.

The narrative shifts to Izu's journey to Kakariko with his team, encountering increased security checkpoints due to martial law. Upon arrival, they reunite with Link's team and discover Link spending time at Lon Lon Ranch with Malon, an old friend who clearly harbors romantic feelings for him. Izu recognizes Link's emotional struggles and takes the opportunity to provide crucial psychological support, emphasizing Link's heroic impact and leadership through inspiration rather than command.

The chapter concludes with Fi successfully restoring Link's divine mark after the corruption from his encounter with Ibboso, though his physical arm injury remains unchanged. The team gathers at a tavern where social dynamics play out—Kellin expertly manipulates a situation to escape Jedal's advances, Koja attempts comedy, and Grenja reveals deep emotional trauma about failing to help children, showing the psychological toll of their recent experiences.
