# Chapter 22.2 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 22.2 delivers the climactic confrontation between Link and Ibboso, revealing the psychological and supernatural warfare that defines their battle. The chapter opens with Ibboso demanding Link pick up his weapons and fight, declaring Link weak and unworthy of his heroic title. Link refuses violence, demonstrating remarkable courage by kicking his weapons away and attempting diplomatic resolution, insisting he came to help rather than fight.

Ibboso delivers a crushing psychological blow by revealing that Hylia's messenger came "ages ago"—implying Link is not the true chosen hero but merely an inadequate replacement. Despite this devastating revelation, Link maintains his resolve to avoid combat, earning Ibboso's grudging respect for his courage even as the ancient king declares he must die.

The battle becomes a masterclass in supernatural psychological warfare when Ibboso begins his physical assault. Link attempts to use Soothe magic, briefly escaping into an illusion where he stands safely with Ryn beside a tomb, but Ibboso's power overwhelms his defenses, revealing the vision as false. This establishes the chapter's central theme: the blurred line between reality and illusion in supernatural combat.

Link demonstrates growing understanding of the supernatural manipulation, recognizing when injuries aren't real and using mental discipline to overcome false pain. His declaration "This isn't real!" and successful self-healing shows his developing ability to combat illusion through willpower and logical analysis.

The climax occurs when Ibboso escalates to threatening Ryn directly, forcing Link into combat by exploiting his protective instincts. Link's rage-fueled magical surge as he rushes to defend her represents his breaking point—the moment where his refusal to fight becomes impossible to maintain. The chapter ends with apparent tragedy as Link's defensive action fails, Ibboso's sword piercing his shoulder and then his chest.

The final image of Link using Blue affinity to project his sight skyward, seeing his own death from above, creates a powerful cliffhanger that questions whether this death is real or another layer of supernatural manipulation. The chapter masterfully blends genuine physical combat with psychological warfare, leaving readers uncertain about what constitutes reality within Ibboso's domain.
