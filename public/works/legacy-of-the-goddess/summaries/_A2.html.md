## Synopsis

Link begins his Royal Guard duties with mundane guard detail outside the Council chamber, feeling frustrated by the tedium and disappointed that he wasn't selected for a recent expedition. Captain Izu approaches him about signing up for a tournament on Remembrance Day, intrigued by Link's reputation for defeating Impa in combat. Though initially hesitant due to his religious beliefs about not showing off, Link considers participating for the entertainment value.

Uncle Raolin apologizes for Link not being chosen for the expedition and invites him to join others for entertainment—a performance by Seff, the Court Minstrel, an old friend from Raolin's barding days. In the castle theater, Seff performs an elaborate musical retelling of ancient Hyrulean history, complete with stage effects, dancers, and dramatic lighting. The story covers the invasion of the twin kingdoms by Blin hordes, the divine intervention of Hylia, and the selection of a champion to lead the defense.

During the interactive portion of the performance, Link is unexpectedly pushed into the spotlight and selected to play the Champion of Hylia. Despite initial panic, he embraces the role and performs admirably in the staged battle sequences, earning thunderous applause from the audience. However, after the show, Link discovers his precious family heirloom necklace is missing.

Searching backstage, Link finds the necklace snagged on a staircase railing and encounters Seff, who admits to having it stolen during the performance. Seff reveals mysterious knowledge about the necklace, suggesting it has supernatural properties and that Link may truly be destined as the Goddesses' champion. He warns Link to "gather your courage" for the times ahead, leaving Link disturbed by the cryptic encounter.

Meanwhile, Impa secretly travels to meet Vian, the leader of the Sheikah, at an abandoned training facility. Vian delivers devastating news: Vesyrn, Impa's former mentor and father figure, has been caught committing treason by consorting with Gerudo agents and possessing magically enhanced aracha venom—the same type used to poison the King. Impa is tasked with a covert mission to investigate and neutralize Vesyrn when he returns from his current assignment, as revealing his betrayal publicly could destabilize the kingdom.

The chapter culminates with Zelda's expedition to meet the Zora. Her journal entries chronicle the journey downstream, documenting wildlife observations and the dangers of wilderness travel. At Zora's Pass, she meets with Golvara, a Zora emissary, rather than the ancient Nineve as hoped. Despite cultural missteps and Golvara's condescending attitude toward Hylians, Zelda successfully conveys her prophetic dreams about the River Hylia flowing backward. Golvara confirms these visions relate to an ancient evil called "Ja'bu" that the Zora will handle themselves. However, when Zelda requests access to additional Wisdom shards, Golvara becomes furious and storms off.

The expedition's return journey passes peacefully until devastating news reaches them at Lurelin: Talus has fallen to a massive, coordinated Blin invasion. The scattered dreams are becoming reality as unprecedented enemy forces march north toward Castletown. Zelda grants emergency war powers to General Wymar Letholdus as the kingdom prepares for what appears to be not a typical Blight, but a war of annihilation. The chapter ends with a war council planning desperate defensive strategies against overwhelming odds—facing nearly half a million organized Blin forces with only 130,000 defenders, most of whom are untrained militia.
