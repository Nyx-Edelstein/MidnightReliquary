# Chapter 27 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 27 follows Champion Izu as he prepares for and executes the infiltration mission to assassinate the Blin Warlord. The chapter opens with Izu in the central guard tower, whittling a wooden remlit figurine for his beloved niece Senni while waiting for intelligence reports. His quiet moments reveal his deep motivation—protecting the innocent people like Senni rather than abstract notions of glory or honor. He reflects on his family: his deceased brother Karvik, sister-in-law Orsella, niece Senni, and wife Meril, all safely residing in Hillford.

The infiltration team consists of Izu, Red Sheikah Gazra (a battle-hardened warrior with oxgoat transformation abilities), Green mage Jedal (chosen for his comfortable relationship with luck magic), and Blue Seeker Kellin (recommended by Laylith for her tracking expertise and fierce competence). Intelligence reports reveal the Blin army has only 20,000 soldiers instead of the expected 90,000, raising concerns about the missing forces. The Warlord is located in a camp with 200-250 Moblins and 1,100-1,200 Bulblins, divided into 22 subcamps.

The mission proceeds smoothly through most infiltration stages, with the team successfully navigating past five subcamps using stealth, magical assistance, and tactical coordination. They encounter unexpected Blin infighting that aids their passage, demonstrating the creatures' unstable nature under stress. Upon reaching the Warlord's position, Izu challenges him to single combat using the Blin phrase "GUGWAYAH" (meaning roughly "fight me"). However, he must first defeat the Lieutenant in a preliminary duel.

Using advanced Coldstepping techniques enhanced by Fi's power, Izu defeats the Lieutenant with spectacular aerial combat maneuvers. The confrontation with the Warlord begins dramatically but ends quickly when the BMOTS telepathic assault from Castletown's mages overwhelms the Warlord, allowing Izu to deliver killing strikes. However, a surviving Moblin attacks during the aftermath, inflicting severe Bloodrage wounds that nearly kill Izu. His team successfully extracts him while Kellin and Gazra carve their escape route.

The chapter concludes with Izu recovering in the infirmary, learning from Queen Zelda that the mission succeeded completely—the Blin army has broken and retreated. Additionally, Zelda reveals that Link's team is alive at Kakariko with a second Courage fragment, providing hope for their broader mission against the growing darkness.
