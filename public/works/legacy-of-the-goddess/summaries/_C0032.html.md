# Chapter 32 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 32 reveals the deepest supernatural truths yet through Zelda's extended dialogue with Lucia, the Fae entity now coinhabiting with Shesan. The chapter opens with Zelda's nervous anticipation before confronting the Fae, weighing Lucia's potential as ally against the risks of possession and Fae corruption. Shesan clarifies that their arrangement is "coinhabitance"—a voluntary compact rather than involuntary possession—though Zelda remains concerned about the possibility of it becoming involuntary.

The core of the chapter occurs in a pocket dimension resembling the Spiritual Realm, where symbolic gestures carry tangible weight and meaning. Lucia appears as a silver-haired Fae identical to Niesis, bound by chromatic shackles that symbolize her self-imposed restraint. Through their dialogue, Lucia reveals her origins as a Void-born entity created when Queen Cordatia's family was murdered, filling the metaphysical Void left by their deaths. She confirms her role in the Reaffirmation legend and establishes Zelda as the reincarnation of Queen Cordatia, explaining that as Blood of Hylia, Zelda represents what remains of the Goddess in the world.

Lucia demonstrates remarkable restraint in her power usage, explaining that Fae become corrupted when they use their abilities to manipulate mortal minds and essence. She reveals the existence of Guardian Spirits—Lanayru, Eldin, and Faron—who protect the realm from Void intrusion but have not intervened, suggesting they are either slumbering, engaged elsewhere, or incapacitated. The Great Barrier, distinct from these Guardians, protects multiple worlds from the Void itself.

Critical warnings emerge about Void Entities being "legion" and "multitudes beyond counting," with strict instructions never to speak their written names. Lucia explains that Fae require Void Power to sustain themselves, and without it they die, preferring death to corruption. She acknowledges the three-question compulsion rule that forces direct answers but warns against testing it.

The chapter reveals Lucia's connection to Ryn through a jade pendant focus, which she used twice to influence Ryn minimally. The pendant's retrieval becomes complicated by Seeker custody requirements. Shesan explains that Fi's incomprehensible language involves advanced technological concepts rather than foreign words, and that she's bound by oath from explaining them.

Lucia promises full revelation about the enemy once Zelda bonds with the remaining Wisdom fragments, as the spiritual transformation will allow safer communication of dangerous concepts. The chapter establishes that Lucia's plan requires Zelda's essence to be fundamentally altered by the fragment bonding process.

The narrative parallels Zelda's supernatural education with Link's military training using the transfabrulator. Izu receives detailed instruction on the ancient weapon's capabilities—creating nearly indestructible geometric blocks for thirty seconds, with offensive launching capabilities and defensive positioning options. The device's sophistication impresses both warriors, though its fifteen-second recharge time limits tactical applications.

The chapter's climax occurs when Link pursues a takkuri that steals his Triforce fragment necklace, leading to a confrontation with an alpha wolfos pack led by a talking beast wielding a Courage fragment. Link defeats the alpha in single combat but falls to the pack's overwhelming numbers. The Triforce fragments resurrect him, allowing him to survive until rescue arrives from his team. This marks the second clear demonstration of the fragments' death-reversal power.
