## Synopsis

Link struggles with insomnia and nightmares, finding solace in the rain while keeping watch from a guard tower in Castletown. His uncle, High Captain Raolin, arrives early and they discuss Link's recent traumatic skirmish where five of his men died from bloodrage after falling into a Blin ambush. Link believes the enemy is becoming too organized, suspecting a Warlord, but Raolin dismisses this concern. When Link points out security gaps in the castle's patrol patterns, Raolin becomes alarmed by his paranoid behavior.

Raolin reveals that Link's assignment as envoy guard was a pretense—he's actually been discharged from active duty after seven years of continuous service without leave. The leadership believes Link is suffering from battle fatigue and jumping at shadows. Despite Link's protests that his calling is to protect others like the Lightsworn of old, Raolin gives him a family heirloom necklace—a jagged golden shard that makes Link feel strangely right when he wears it. The necklace seems to calm his troubled thoughts.

Raolin arranges for Link to join the Royal Guard, claiming it's prestigious and will give him opportunities to escort Princess Zelda on her countryside expeditions. Despite Link's initial resistance to being a "glorified doormat," he reluctantly agrees to consider it, and Raolin immediately schedules him for a meeting.

Meanwhile, Princess Zelda meets with Sage Amaurath and the manipulative Counselor Taetus to discuss her various projects. Her Blindscrier communication network failed its initial test due to fiend attacks on towers, leading to casualties and massive costs. Taetus successfully argues for scaling back the project. Her magical crop enhancement (Greenery) project has plateaued and is put on hiatus. During the meeting, Zelda drinks multiple cups of nightshade tea to calm her nerves, but overconsumes and becomes intoxicated, embarrassing herself.

After the meeting, Impa, the Sheikah guardian, confronts Zelda about her behavior. Taetus has made the case that Zelda is unfit to rule, and there are discussions of declaring an interregnum. Zelda's father, the King, is dying from an unknown illness, leaving the kingdom's future uncertain. Zelda confesses she feels unprepared to rule and considers abdication, but Impa reminds her of the prophetic dreams she's been having—visions of the River Hylia running backward, shadows moving across the desert, and earthquakes shattering the land.

Impa convinces Zelda that these dreams are divine messages from the Goddesses, particularly connected to Nayru's wisdom embodied in her bracers. Zelda finally resolves to take action, deciding they will visit the Zora. Earlier, Impa had tested Link for the Royal Guard and was stunned by his supernatural speed and reflexes during their sparring match—abilities that seemed beyond normal human capability.

The chapter ends darkly with Impa descending into secret underground chambers where she has been conducting experiments on prisoners, trying to find a cure for the King's affliction. She systematically executes the remaining test subjects, including a man named Larus, as she "cleans up" the failed experiments.
