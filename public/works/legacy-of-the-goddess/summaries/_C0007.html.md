# Chapter 7 Summary

## Synopsis

Chapter 7 opens with Zelda seeking solitude on a guard tower, overwhelmed by the constant demands of leadership and questioning her capabilities compared to her father. She observes that Taetus has successfully cleared the refuse from the city but remains conflicted about his methods and authority. Zelda meets with Lensa to discuss the Lynx's response through an emissary named Naibi, leading to Zelda's decision to personally travel to Last Bastion for diplomatic negotiations despite Lensa's initial resistance. Their conversation reveals Zelda's political misstep in threatening Taetus, prompting Lensa to suggest establishing a tribunal for oversight. The chapter transitions to Zelda's journey with Vestele to the Temple of Time, where they discuss magical artifacts and legends from Zelda's research notes. Vestele reveals that several mythical items are real, including the Basilisk's Gaze (a Red magic called Stasis) and Soulsteel (connected to Void magic rather than Red magic). Most significantly, Vestele explains that the Golden Three's fragments aren't just sources of pure magic—they ARE the source of all magic itself. In the temple vaults, Zelda encounters Niesis, a imprisoned Fae who had willingly submitted to imprisonment after helping the Seekers seal away other Fae. Against Vestele's reservations, Zelda attempts to temporarily release Niesis using Fi's power to recharge an ancient scepter. The attempt succeeds catastrophically—the scepter shatters, Zelda is knocked unconscious, and she experiences a cosmic vision revealing the fundamental creation myth: the Void dividing into Creation and Destruction, the formation of reality's three layers (Divinity, Concept, Substance), and her own divine awakening as Hylia with the embodiment of Wisdom, Power, and Courage before meeting the three Golden Goddesses. Zelda awakens to find Niesis has escaped from her imprisonment.

## Character Actions

**Zelda**: Seeks solitude on a guard tower to contemplate her leadership challenges and her father's memory, questioning her effectiveness compared to his decisiveness. Observes the city's improvement under Taetus while maintaining conflicted feelings about his methods. Decides to personally travel to Last Bastion for diplomatic meetings despite security concerns. Discusses political strategy with Lensa, learning she made tactical errors in threatening Taetus and agreeing to establish oversight tribunals. Travels with Vestele to Temple of Time to research magical artifacts and historical knowledge. Reviews her compiled research notes with Vestele, learning that several legendary items including Stasis and Soulsteel are real. Discovers the profound truth that Triforce fragments are the actual source of all magic rather than mere conduits. Encounters the imprisoned Fae Niesis and, despite Vestele's concerns, decides to attempt temporary release to gain valuable historical knowledge. Uses Fi's divine power to recharge the ancient sealing scepter, causing it to shatter and knocking herself unconscious. Experiences a cosmic vision of reality's creation and her own divine awakening as Hylia before being created by the Golden Goddesses. Awakens to discover Niesis has escaped, creating a potentially dangerous situation.

**Lensa**: Reports on the Lynx's response through emissary Naibi, initially dismissing the diplomatic opportunity as unreasonable. Challenges Zelda's decision to travel personally to Last Bastion, arguing it would appear as abandoning the city. Tests Zelda's authority through direct contradiction and patronizing behavior until firmly corrected. Analyzes Zelda's political misstep with Taetus, explaining how the threat played into his hands and positioned him favorably with common folk. Provides strategic counsel about establishing oversight tribunals including herself and Nyllara to constrain Taetus while allowing his effectiveness to continue. Offers to handle herald announcements about the diplomatic mission, supporting Zelda's decision once proper authority is established.

**Vestele**: Travels with Zelda in carriage to Temple of Time, reviewing Zelda's research notes with scholarly interest. Confirms the reality of several legendary magical artifacts including the Basilisk's Gaze (Stasis Red magic) and Soulsteel (Void magic connection). Reveals fundamental truth about Triforce fragments being the source of magic itself rather than conduits, correcting Zelda's understanding of magical theory. Guides Zelda through temple vaults to encounter imprisoned Fae Niesis, explaining her willing submission to imprisonment and role in sealing other Fae. Expresses reservations about releasing Niesis temporarily, citing legitimate concerns about Fae dangers and unknown risks. Reluctantly supports Zelda's decision to proceed with the release attempt while maintaining protective oversight with temple monks.

**Fi**: Materializes when summoned by Zelda in the temple vault, maintaining her characteristic formal manner. Transfers substantial divine power (initially 10%, then three-quarters of remaining reserves) into the ancient scepter to attempt recharging its sealing capabilities. Successfully transfers energy that temporarily activates the scepter before its catastrophic failure and Niesis's release.

**Niesis**: Appears as a beautiful, glowing young woman suspended in divine light within the temple vault, imprisoned by ancient Seekers but having willingly submitted to imprisonment. Escapes when Zelda's attempt to temporarily release her causes the scepter to shatter, though her current location and intentions remain unknown after Zelda's unconsciousness.

**Link**: Accompanies Zelda on the journey to Temple of Time as part of her security detail, having insisted on additional Sheikah protection (six total including Cove). Participates in the deception strategy where Zelda secretly joins the traveling party while a decoy publicly departs from the main gate.

**Cove**: Serves as one of six Sheikah providing security for Zelda's journey to Temple of Time, participating in the covert departure strategy to protect the queen from potential assassination attempts during travel.

**Sera**: Provides wine service during Zelda and Lensa's private meeting, discreetly receiving whispered instructions from Lensa while maintaining professional attentiveness to their discussion.

**Taetus**: Not present but significantly discussed - revealed to have successfully cleaned refuse from the city, demonstrating administrative competence that frustrates Zelda. His political maneuvering and popular support with common folk creates strategic challenges for royal authority, leading to proposals for oversight rather than replacement.

**Temple Monks**: Twelve robed monks with tattooed faces accompany Vestele and Zelda through temple vaults, providing security and assistance with the heavy vault mechanisms. Exchange concerned glances when Fi materializes but follow Zelda's authority in the dangerous attempt to release Niesis.
