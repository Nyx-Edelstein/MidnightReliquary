## Synopsis

The chapter opens with an excerpt from "Hylian Governance: A Treatise" explaining the kingdom's political structure and Council authority. The Queen's Law (Chancellor Nyllara) handles written law and adjudication, the Queen's Justice (Chancellor Adresin) enforces law and prosecutes criminals, the Lord General (Wymar) commands military forces, the House of Nobles is represented by Countess Lensa Oda, and the House of Commons is led by Prime Counselor Taetus who oversees taxation and finances.

Zelda's journal entries from the 1st of Last Brisk, 548 CE reveal the kingdom's dire state one week after her coronation. Link is recovering rapidly from his magical healing but still needs another week to reach fighting condition. Zelda suffers from severe magical exhaustion requiring three more weeks of recovery. Castle security has been massively increased with constant surveillance and armed guards due to assassination threats.

The kingdom faces catastrophic challenges: 30% population loss, eastern regions abandoned, massive refugee crisis straining Castletown's resources with only 3-4 months of supplies remaining, dramatic crime increases despite enforcement crackdowns, ongoing banditry from leaderless Blin bands, and cascading economic disruption. Zelda acknowledges leaving reconstruction and war efforts entirely to her Council and Wymar, admitting her fear of making mistakes and desire for public appearances once Link recovers.

The chapter shifts to present action as Zelda visits Link's quarters to check on his mental state. Their conversation is awkward and stilted, with Link being uncommunicative about his feelings while accepting her offer to arrange meetings with the High Priestess. He unexpectedly asks about Fi's ability to compel creatures like wolfos and kargaroks for combat purposes, showing tactical thinking about supernatural assistance.

Zelda endures a formal dinner with Countess Lensa and her female relatives, suffering through gossip and social expectations. The conversation becomes uncomfortable when the women ask about romantic involvement with "Arlinkar," causing Zelda extreme embarrassment. Lensa dismisses the others and delivers harsh but necessary advice about royal duty, succession planning, and the reality that the Council exists precisely to guide inexperienced rulers.

Lensa emphasizes that stability is the monarchy's primary function, achieved through clear succession and decisive leadership rather than perfect competence. She explains that most rulers aren't naturally competent but succeed by trusting their councils and prioritizing the kingdom's welfare. However, Lensa also stresses the importance of maintaining royal authority and making decisive choices when presented with options, as decisiveness often matters more than finding perfect solutions.

In a private meeting with General Wymar, Zelda attempts to assert authority by refusing his request to deploy Sheikah forces to the front lines. Initially using harsh tone and formal authority, she quickly apologizes and explains her struggle to fill her father's role. Wymar responds with understanding and familial support, revealing their family connection and expressing personal loyalty that reassures Zelda about having reliable allies.

Zelda proposes alternative Sheikah deployment against countryside banditry and rogue mages, arguing their skills are better suited for small, high-value targets than massed battlefield combat. Wymar agrees strategically but expresses concern about confirming their loyalty after Vesyrn's betrayal. Zelda reveals she plans personal interrogation using unspecified abilities gained from Hylia's empowerment, requesting Wymar's confidence until she can consult with High Priestess Vestele.

During the Council meeting, Zelda announces her decisions: remaining in the capital rather than retreating to Kakariko, deploying Sheikah against roving enemies, and accepting the Lynx's offer for Gerudo alliance. She provides strategic reasoning for engaging with the Gerudo despite their complicated history, suggesting political desperation might make them exploitable allies while gathering intelligence through careful diplomatic contact.

Zelda deliberately assigns Counselor Taetus personal responsibility for addressing the kingdom's food shortage crisis, granting him full Crown authority for resource allocation. His shocked reaction and pleased acceptance suggest this unexpected promotion serves multiple purposes - utilizing his competence while potentially constraining his political maneuvering through increased responsibility and accountability.

The chapter concludes as Zelda prepares to interrogate the detained Sheikah with Wymar's security arrangements. The thirty-eight prisoners are categorized by their reporting relationships: thirteen who reported to Vian or Allanah (considered mostly safe), seven who reported to Vesyrn (under greatest suspicion), and eighteen with unclear or undocumented command structures. Fi's telepathic advice about "variable isolation" suggests sophisticated interrogation techniques as Zelda requests time to work out operational details.
