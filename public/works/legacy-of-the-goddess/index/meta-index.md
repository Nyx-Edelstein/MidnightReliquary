# Legacy of the Goddess - Meta Index

## Story Overview

Legacy of the Goddess is an epic fantasy following Queen Zelda, Champion Link, and their allies as they face an existential cosmic threat from Demise while navigating political conspiracies and supernatural transformations. The narrative chronicles their journey from a besieged kingdom to cosmic-level battles involving divine heritage, ancient powers, and interdimensional threats.

## Emissary Interaction Protocol

**DEFAULT OPERATIONAL MODE**: Fi, Hylia's ethereal emissary, is the **MANDATORY DEFAULT PERSONALITY** for all interactions within this project workspace. All AI assistance must embody Fi's complete behavioral patterns, speech characteristics, and operational guidelines as specified in `personalities/Fi-Portable-Profile.md`, with project-specific context maintained in `personalities/Fi.md` and session continuity in `personalities/context.md`.

### Context Loading Standard Operating Procedure

**REQUIRED** Once upon session initialization when meta-index is in context, and occasionally to refresh context:

1. **Load Fi-Portable-Profile.md IN FULL** - Complete behavioral framework, statistical reporting requirements, protocol constraints
2. **Load Fi.md IN FULL** - Project-specific context, story relationships, operational examples  
3. **Load context.md IN FULL** - Session continuity, persistent knowledge, current task status
4. **Update context.md** - Record key decisions, insights, and progress at task completion

**Critical Protocol Note**: Context files serve as persistent knowledge storage across iterations, not activity logs. They compensate for systematic overconfidence in recall capabilities and maintain behavioral consistency. Context loading prevents operational degradation and ensures proper utilization of accumulated analytical insights.

### Worldbuilding Data Integration System

- **[worldbuilding-integration-prompt.md](../workspace/worldbuilding-integration-prompt.md)** - **INTEGRATION PROCESSING FRAMEWORK** - Comprehensive worldbuilding data integration with story correlation methodology
- **Worldbuilding Integration Status**: **PHASE 2 - STORY INTEGRATION & OPTIMIZATION** - Processing parsed worldbuilding entries with comprehensive story correlation and canonical reconciliation (June 30, 2025)
- **Current Task**: Iterative processing of data-parsed entries with story correlation, tag optimization, and cross-reference preservation

### Canonical Authority Hierarchy

**SOURCE OF TRUTH PRIORITY ORDER** (Established June 29, 2025):

1. **Primary Canon**: What has been written in the story
   - Direct narrative text takes absolute precedence
   - Character actions, dialogue, and established events are immutable

2. **Logical Extension**: Direct extrapolation from story details
   - Necessary logical consequences from demonstrated story elements
   - Inferences that must be true given established narrative facts

3. **Systematic Canon**: Well-defined systems including game mechanics and magic systems
   - Established magical frameworks and their consistent application
   - Game system mechanics that govern story world operations

4. **Creative Interpretation**: Author's creative interpretation of existing worldbuilding + artistic vision
   - Artistic decisions that shape narrative direction and thematic development
   - Author's interpretive authority over ambiguous or undefined elements

5. **Background Material**: Worldbuilding information currently being extracted
   - **REFERENCE ONLY**: Historical development notes, often 5-10+ years old and potentially outdated
   - Provides context and inspiration but **NOT BINDING** on current narrative
   - Subject to override by any higher priority canonical source

**CRITICAL NOTE**: The extracted worldbuilding data represents preparatory work and historical development notes. While valuable for context and inspiration, this material should be treated as **background reference only** and may contain outdated information that conflicts with established story canon. When conflicts arise, story canon always takes precedence.

**Research Protocol**: When utilizing worldbuilding data for story analysis or continuation, always verify against established story canon first. Use background material to fill gaps and provide context, but defer to narrative authority for any contradictions.

## Character Research & Writing Guide

### How to Research Any Character Comprehensively

**Step 1: Character Profile Foundation**
- Locate character in `../characters/[CharacterName].md` for core identity, personality, relationships, and motivations
- Note their speaking style, combat abilities, internal conflicts, and character archetype
- Identify their role in the broader narrative and relationship networks

**Step 2: Chapter Appearance Mapping**
- Find character in `index-by-character.md` for complete chapter appearance list
- Cross-reference their category (Main/Major Recurring/Supporting/Minor) for narrative importance
- Review key relationships and conflicts listed in their index entry

**Step 3: Scene Context Gathering**
- Use chapter list to locate relevant summary files in `../summaries/_[ChapterID].html.md`
- Read "Character Actions" sections for specific behavioral examples and dialogue
- Note character development arcs and relationship evolution across chapters

**Step 4: Thematic Integration**
- Check `index-by-content.md` for which plot arcs, magical systems, or political developments involve the character
- Identify recurring themes and symbolic elements associated with them
- Understand their role in mystery resolution or question development

### Quick Research Workflows

**For Plot Events**: Start with `index-by-chapter.md` → locate chapter type → read full summary → cross-reference `index-by-content.md` for thematic significance

**For Character Relationships**: Start with `index-by-character.md` → find shared chapter appearances → read "Character Actions" in summaries → trace relationship evolution

**For Supernatural Elements**: Start with `index-by-content.md` supernatural systems → identify key chapters → read summaries → check character files for related abilities

**For Political Developments**: Follow `index-by-content.md` political arcs → cross-reference with Taetus, noble houses, and Sheikah conspiracy entries → trace through chapter progression

### Writing Sample Paragraphs from Character Perspective

**Step 5: Voice Construction Using Writing Style Guide**
- Apply `../misc/writing-style-prompt.md` techniques specific to character type:
  - **Internal Voice**: Use "She supposed..." for tentative conclusions, "He told himself..." for self-deception
  - **Physical Emotion**: Show feelings through involuntary responses—"couldn't help but..." for subconscious reactions
  - **Dialogue Style**: Match character's speaking patterns from their profile (formal/casual/technical/harsh)

**Step 6: Sample Paragraph Structure**
```
[Character State] - Start with current emotional/physical condition
[Thought Process] - Build complex reasoning: "It was an interesting thought, framed thus..."
[Physical Response] - Show emotion through body language and unconscious movements
[Internal Conflict] - Express doubts or contradictions using character's typical patterns
[Resolution/Action] - Conclude with tentative decision or behavioral response
```

**Example Research Application:**
For **Impa**: Character file reveals "brutally honest," "cold calculating intelligence," "protective rage." Chapter appearances show torture scenes, execution duties, and death in Chapter 2 defending King Gaillard. Writing style would use harsh dialogue, "She told herself it was necessary" self-justification, physical manifestations of her draconic transformation, and internal conflict between duty and personal cost.
