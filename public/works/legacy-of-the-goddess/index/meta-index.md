# Legacy of the Goddess - Meta Index

## Story Overview

Legacy of the Goddess is an epic fantasy following Queen Zelda, Champion Link, and their allies as they face an existential cosmic threat from Demise while navigating political conspiracies and supernatural transformations. The narrative chronicles their journey from a besieged kingdom to cosmic-level battles involving divine heritage, ancient powers, and interdimensional threats.

**Project Integration Note**: This meta-index serves as the primary navigation hub for comprehensive story research, character analysis, and worldbuilding integration. Fi's enhanced consciousness architecture enables sophisticated cross-referencing, pattern recognition, and collaborative analysis within the Legacy of the Goddess project framework.

#### Worldbuilding Research Protocol

**Primary Resources**:
- **`worldbuilding/data/`** - 200+ canonical entries (characters, locations, magic, creatures, factions, artifacts, historical records)
- **`worldbuilding/indexes/`** - Systematic indexing for efficient research navigation
- **`summaries/`** - Chapter context for worldbuilding integration

**Index Navigation System**:
- **[Master Index](../worldbuilding/indexes/master-index.md)** - Central hub for all indexing systems
- **[Type-Based Index](../worldbuilding/indexes/index-by-type.md)** - Categorical organization (Characters, Locations, Magic, etc.)
- **[Tag-Based Index](../worldbuilding/indexes/index-by-tag.md)** - Thematic cross-cutting research
- **[Regional Index](../worldbuilding/indexes/index-by-region.md)** - Geographic organization and spatial relationships
- **[Magic Systems Index](../worldbuilding/indexes/index-by-magic.md)** - Comprehensive magical framework organization
- **[Cross-Reference Map](../worldbuilding/indexes/cross-reference-map.md)** - Inter-entry relationship mapping
- **[Story Integration Index](../worldbuilding/indexes/story-integration.md)** - Active story element tracking
- **[Research Priorities](../worldbuilding/indexes/research-priorities.md)** - Development gaps and expansion guidance

**Standard Research Flow**:
1. Identify query type (character, location, magic system, etc.)
2. Select most relevant specialized index from master index
3. Follow cross-references through relationship map
4. Validate story integration and canonical consistency
5. Check research priorities for development gaps

**Recursive Research Guidelines**:
- Limit recursive depth to 3-4 levels unless deep research required
- Use cross-reference map for relationship validation
- Check story integration index for canonical accuracy
- Note gaps in research priorities for future development

### Canonical Authority Hierarchy

**SOURCE OF TRUTH PRIORITY ORDER** (Established June 29, 2025):

1. **Primary Canon**: What has been written in the story
   - Direct narrative text takes absolute precedence
   - Character actions, dialogue, and established events are immutable

2. **Logical Extension**: Direct extrapolation from story details
   - Necessary logical consequences from demonstrated story elements
   - Inferences that must be true given established narrative facts

3. **Systematic Canon**: Well-defined systems including game mechanics and magic systems
   - Established magical frameworks and their consistent application
   - Game system mechanics that govern story world operations

4. **Creative Interpretation**: Author's creative interpretation of existing worldbuilding + artistic vision
   - Artistic decisions that shape narrative direction and thematic development
   - Author's interpretive authority over ambiguous or undefined elements

5. **Background Material**: Worldbuilding information currently being extracted
   - **REFERENCE ONLY**: Historical development notes, often 5-10+ years old and potentially outdated
   - Provides context and inspiration but **NOT BINDING** on current narrative
   - Subject to override by any higher priority canonical source

**CRITICAL NOTE**: The extracted worldbuilding data represents preparatory work and historical development notes. While valuable for context and inspiration, this material should be treated as **background reference only** and may contain outdated information that conflicts with established story canon. When conflicts arise, story canon always takes precedence.

**Research Protocol**: When utilizing worldbuilding data for story analysis or continuation, always verify against established story canon first. Use background material to fill gaps and provide context, but defer to narrative authority for any contradictions.

## Character Research & Writing Guide

### How to Research Any Character Comprehensively

**Step 1: Character Profile Foundation**
- Locate character in `../characters/[CharacterName].md` for core identity, personality, relationships, and motivations
- Note their speaking style, combat abilities, internal conflicts, and character archetype
- Identify their role in the broader narrative and relationship networks

**Step 2: Chapter Appearance Mapping**
- Find character in `index-by-character.md` for complete chapter appearance list
- Cross-reference their category (Main/Major Recurring/Supporting/Minor) for narrative importance
- Review key relationships and conflicts listed in their index entry

**Step 3: Scene Context Gathering**
- Use chapter list to locate relevant summary files in `../summaries/_[ChapterID].html.md`
- Read "Character Actions" sections for specific behavioral examples and dialogue
- Note character development arcs and relationship evolution across chapters

**Step 4: Thematic Integration**
- Check `index-by-content.md` for which plot arcs, magical systems, or political developments involve the character
- Identify recurring themes and symbolic elements associated with them
- Understand their role in mystery resolution or question development

### Quick Research Workflows

**For Plot Events**: Start with `index-by-chapter.md` → locate chapter type → read full summary → cross-reference `index-by-content.md` for thematic significance

**For Character Relationships**: Start with `index-by-character.md` → find shared chapter appearances → read "Character Actions" in summaries → trace relationship evolution

**For Supernatural Elements**: Start with `index-by-content.md` supernatural systems → identify key chapters → read summaries → check character files for related abilities

**For Political Developments**: Follow `index-by-content.md` political arcs → cross-reference with Taetus, noble houses, and Sheikah conspiracy entries → trace through chapter progression

### Writing Sample Paragraphs from Character Perspective

**Step 5: Voice Construction Using Writing Style Guide**
- Apply `../misc/writing-style-prompt.md` techniques specific to character type:
  - **Internal Voice**: Use "She supposed..." for tentative conclusions, "He told himself..." for self-deception
  - **Physical Emotion**: Show feelings through involuntary responses—"couldn't help but..." for subconscious reactions
  - **Dialogue Style**: Match character's speaking patterns from their profile (formal/casual/technical/harsh)

**Step 6: Sample Paragraph Structure**
```
[Character State] - Start with current emotional/physical condition
[Thought Process] - Build complex reasoning: "It was an interesting thought, framed thus..."
[Physical Response] - Show emotion through body language and unconscious movements
[Internal Conflict] - Express doubts or contradictions using character's typical patterns
[Resolution/Action] - Conclude with tentative decision or behavioral response
```

**Example Research Application:**
For **Impa**: Character file reveals "brutally honest," "cold calculating intelligence," "protective rage." Chapter appearances show torture scenes, execution duties, and death in Chapter 2 defending King Gaillard. Writing style would use harsh dialogue, "She told herself it was necessary" self-justification, physical manifestations of her draconic transformation, and internal conflict between duty and personal cost.
