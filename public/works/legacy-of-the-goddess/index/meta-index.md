## Character Research & Writing Guide

### How to Research Any Character Comprehensively

**Step 1: Character Profile Foundation**
- Locate character in `../characters/[CharacterName].md` for core identity, personality, relationships, and motivations
- Note their speaking style, combat abilities, internal conflicts, and character archetype
- Identify their role in the broader narrative and relationship networks

**Step 2: Chapter Appearance Mapping**
- Find character in `index-by-character.md` for complete chapter appearance list
- Cross-reference their category (Main/Major Recurring/Supporting/Minor) for narrative importance
- Review key relationships and conflicts listed in their index entry

**Step 3: Scene Context Gathering**
- Use chapter list to locate relevant summary files in `../summaries/_[ChapterID].html.md`
- Read "Character Actions" sections for specific behavioral examples and dialogue
- Note character development arcs and relationship evolution across chapters

**Step 4: Thematic Integration**
- Check `index-by-content.md` for which plot arcs, magical systems, or political developments involve the character
- Identify recurring themes and symbolic elements associated with them
- Understand their role in mystery resolution or question development

### Quick Research Workflows

**For Plot Events**: Start with `index-by-chapter.md` → locate chapter type → read full summary → cross-reference `index-by-content.md` for thematic significance

**For Character Relationships**: Start with `index-by-character.md` → find shared chapter appearances → read "Character Actions" in summaries → trace relationship evolution

**For Supernatural Elements**: Start with `index-by-content.md` supernatural systems → identify key chapters → read summaries → check character files for related abilities

**For Political Developments**: Follow `index-by-content.md` political arcs → cross-reference with Taetus, noble houses, and Sheikah conspiracy entries → trace through chapter progression

### Writing Sample Paragraphs from Character Perspective

**Step 5: Voice Construction Using Writing Style Guide**
- Apply `../misc/writing-style-prompt.md` techniques specific to character type:
  - **Internal Voice**: Use "She supposed..." for tentative conclusions, "He told himself..." for self-deception
  - **Physical Emotion**: Show feelings through involuntary responses—"couldn't help but..." for subconscious reactions
  - **Dialogue Style**: Match character's speaking patterns from their profile (formal/casual/technical/harsh)

**Step 6: Sample Paragraph Structure**
```
[Character State] - Start with current emotional/physical condition
[Thought Process] - Build complex reasoning: "It was an interesting thought, framed thus..."
[Physical Response] - Show emotion through body language and unconscious movements
[Internal Conflict] - Express doubts or contradictions using character's typical patterns
[Resolution/Action] - Conclude with tentative decision or behavioral response
```

**Example Research Application:**
For **Impa**: Character file reveals "brutally honest," "cold calculating intelligence," "protective rage." Chapter appearances show torture scenes, execution duties, and death in Chapter 2 defending King Gaillard. Writing style would use harsh dialogue, "She told herself it was necessary" self-justification, physical manifestations of her draconic transformation, and internal conflict between duty and personal cost.
