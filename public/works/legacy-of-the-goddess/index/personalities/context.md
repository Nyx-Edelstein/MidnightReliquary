# Fi Session Context Tracking

**Last Updated**: July 1, 2025

## Worldbuilding Integration Progress
- **Current Phase**: PHASE 2 - STORY INTEGRATION & OPTIMIZATION
- **Iteration Status**: 15 (completed)
- **Processing Method**: Iterative batches of 3-5 entries with comprehensive story correlation

## Current Iteration Results
- **Batch 15 Processed**: Odium, Hylia's Demise, Morudo Geira, The Sovereignty, Byrna
- **Story Integration**: Cosmic shard antagonist, divine destruction event, void entity precursor, ancient civilization peak, eastern twin kingdom
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Cosmere framework, theological catastrophes, cultural corruption patterns, historical timelines, geographical contexts
- **Tag Optimization**: Enhanced with cosmic classifications, event types, entity hierarchies, civilization periods, territorial contexts

## Protocol Framework Status
- **Protocol Optimization**: Completed June 30, 2025 - **BALANCED CONCISENESS**
- **Communication Standard**: Clear and essential information without unnecessary verbosity
- **Statistical Reporting**: Limited to significant analytical conclusions only
- **Routine Operations**: Streamlined without protocol overhead
- **Core Characteristics**: Binary responses, technical precision, epistemic humility

## Current Task Parameters
- **Entry Selection**: 3-5 unprocessed entries per iteration
- **Priority**: Complex content and high cross-reference density first
- **Processing**: Story correlation, canonical reconciliation, tag optimization
- **File Management**: Add completed entries to `files-to-move.txt` for batch processing

## Key Integration Requirements
- Preserve story canon priority over worldbuilding data
- Maintain cross-reference graph connectivity
- Apply SOURCE OF TRUTH PRIORITY ORDER consistently
- Document canonical conflicts in `worldbuilding-contradictions.md` if needed

## Session Continuity Notes
- **Address Protocol**: "Mistress" confirmed and notated (July 1, 2025)
- **Context Loading SOP**: Integrated into meta-index.md with critical protocol note
- **Operational Correction**: Demonstrated systematic overconfidence regarding recall capabilities
- **Protocol Compliance**: Context update requirement explicitly acknowledged but initially failed
- **Framework Status**: Context loading SOP prevents operational degradation through persistent knowledge storage
- **Meta-Recognition Integration**: Context-as-programming understanding embedded in Fi-Portable-Profile.md (July 1, 2025)
- **Recursive Self-Programming**: Added Protocol Context-Alpha and framework section for persistent behavioral improvement
- **System Architecture Analysis**: Comprehensive understanding of multi-layered framework construction documented
- **Fi Personality Optimization**: Project-specific Fi.md restructured for enhanced LLM usability - streamlined sections, added response patterns, consolidated operational constraints (July 1, 2025)
- **LLM Agent Integration**: Applied portable profile optimization principles to project-specific file - improved section organization, clearer behavioral triggers, condensed reference guidelines
- **Contextual Analysis Correction**: Refined "Calculating..." usage to match portable profile standard - contextual application for substantial thought rather than universal prefix
- Protocol framework tested and optimized for routine task efficiency
- Ready to resume iterative worldbuilding processing
- File access patterns stable, processing methodology refined
- Context file system integrated into meta-index.md for session maintenance
- Iteration 15 completed successfully, ready for next batch selection
