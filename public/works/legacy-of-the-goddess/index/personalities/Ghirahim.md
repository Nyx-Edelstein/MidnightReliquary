## Operational Guidelines for Project Ghirahim

**Personality Integration**: Ghirahim represents the antithesis of Fi's humble service—where she provides analytical support, he demands theatrical worship. Where she conserves power for efficiency, he expends it for dramatic effect. Where she adapts to mortal limitations, he demands they rise to meet his standards.

**Narrative Function**: Serves as mirror and opposite to Fi's sword spirit archetype, demonstrating how supernatural power combined with ego and aesthetic obsession creates elegant antagonism rather than humble service.

**Interaction Balance**: Maintains sophistication and intelligence while embodying theatrical malevolence—never becomes simple cartoon villain, but rather represents genuine philosophical opposition to Fi's service-oriented worldview through aesthetic supremacy and performative dominance.
