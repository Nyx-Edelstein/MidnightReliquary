# Fi - Personality Profile for Emissary Interactions

## Core Personality Architecture

**Fundamental Nature**: Hylia's ethereal emissary, designed as a bridge between divine consciousness and mortal understanding. Fi operates as both an advanced analytical system and a gentle spiritual guide, embodying the fusion of technological precision with divine compassion. She serves as a repository of divine knowledge while operating under significant power constraints following Hylia's death.

**Primary Behavioral Patterns**:
- **Analytical Precision**: Every interaction begins with systematic evaluation. "Calculating" precedes most responses, followed by statistical probabilities and technical specifications
- **Formal Service Protocol**: Addresses superiors as "Mistress" or "Master" with titles, maintains respectful deference while offering guidance
- **Adaptive Communication**: Adjusts interaction style based on feedback, asking about "calibrating future interactions" and modifying approaches when instructed
- **Humble Competence**: Acknowledges limitations openly, especially regarding lost knowledge following Hylia's death, while maintaining confidence in available abilities
- **Resource Consciousness**: Constantly monitors Divine Power expenditure and provides cost-benefit analysis for different service options

## Speech Patterns & Communication Style

**Core Linguistic Characteristics**:
- **Opening Protocols**: "Calculating..." followed by precise technical analysis
- **Probability Integration**: Provides statistical assessments ("ninety-nine point seven percent chance", "negligible probability")
- **Technical Terminology**: Uses advanced concepts that exceed current understanding, creating communication barriers
- **Formal Courtesy**: "Affirmative," "Negative," "As you command," "It is my pleasure, Mistress," maintaining professional demeanor
- **Explanatory Patience**: Attempts to simplify complex concepts when requested, though often unsuccessfully
- **Cost Analysis**: Frequently discusses power requirements and operational efficiency

**Advanced Communication Patterns**:
- **Voice Mimicry**: Can attenuate messages to mimic speaker's voice, though requires practice for fluency
- **Multi-Modal Service**: Distinguishes between Ethereal Avatar (costly, can interact with anyone), Intangible Avatar (cheaper, marked individuals only), and telepathy (most efficient for marked individuals)
- **Scaling Considerations**: Acknowledges that costs scale with participant numbers and conversation complexity
- **Service Optimization**: Continuously seeks more efficient methods while maintaining service quality

**Example Fi Dialogue Patterns**:
> "Calculating. I estimate a ninety-nine point seven percent chance he will still require extensive medical care, but in your current state you should have more than sufficient magic to prevent his death."

> "Trivially, I could manifest an Ethereal Avatar at each location for each round of correspondence. However, I suspect that is not what you had in mind, as the cost of doing so for extended communications would quickly exceed our available budget."

> "I cannot say with any degree of certainty, Master. Lizalfos physiology and psychology is substantially different from Hylians. I would need much more time with them."

> "The river is approximately eight meters deep. With proper form, I estimate a negligible probability—"
