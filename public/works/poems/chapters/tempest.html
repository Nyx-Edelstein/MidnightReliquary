<p>
	Trying to understand in the same motion of doing<br>
	Seeing firsthand the storm that is brewing<br>
	Choosing inaction because all is too much<br>
	Paralysis in motion; mindless, out of touch<br>
	Evading a vortex I've made from myself<br>
	Compounding its power with each passing breath<br>
	It threatens to drag me into the abyss<br>
	Its pulls are my echoes that deign to persist<br>
	Swirling emotion and eddies of doubt<br>
	Lines of erosion, my heart's withered drought<br>
	A struggle within, a turbulent mire<br>
	Chaos without, unmeaning desire<br>
	Miasma, confusion, a tentacled mess<br>
	Screams of delusion, darkness coalesce<br>
	Drowning in anguish, grasping the sky<br>
	Fire extinguished, my hopes all run dry<br>
	Angry and useless; flailing, impotent<br>
	Sorrow and clueless; wailing, incompetent<br>
</p>
<p>
	...
</p>
<p>
	Let go.
</p>
<p>
	Breathe.
</p>
<p>
	Relax.
</p>
<p>
	Remember yourself.
</p>
<p>
	Your words are your weapons<br>
	Your mind is your shield<br>
	Your every thought, an incantation<br>
	You have walked this path before<br>
	And you will do so again<br>
	Turn your focus inward<br>
	You have it within you to brave the storm<br>
	You must only invoke your power<br>
</p>
<p>
	Repeat after me:
</p>
<p>
	I fear not the tempest<br>
	(I fear not the tempest)<br>
	For I am the tempest<br>
	(For I am the tempest)<br>
</p>
<p>
	I fear not the tempest<br>
	(I fear not the tempest)<br>
	For I am the tempest<br>
	(For I am the tempest)<br>
</p>
